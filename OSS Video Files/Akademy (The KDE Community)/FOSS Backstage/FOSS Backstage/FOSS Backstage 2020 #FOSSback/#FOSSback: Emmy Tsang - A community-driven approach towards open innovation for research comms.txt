	More info: https://20.foss-backstage.de/session/community-driven-approach-towards-open-innovation-research-communication

The advancement of web technologies has created an opportunity for developing tools for real-time collaborations, text-mining, interactive data visualisations, sharing reproducible compute environments, etc. These tools can change the ways researchers share, discover, consume and evaluate research and help promote open science and encourage responsible research behaviours. 

Through its Innovation Initiative, eLife invests heavily in software development, new product design, collaboration and outreach so that the potential for improvements in the digital communication of new research can start to be realised. 

In particular, we support exclusively the development of open-source tools, with extensible capabilities, that can be used, adopted and modified by any interested party and actively engage the community of open innovators. In this talk, we will introduce the following projects: 
* Fostering collaboration and innovation through hacking: eLife Innovation Sprint (https://elifesci.org/Sprint) 
* Mentoring and empowering a generation of open innovators: eLife Innovation Leaders (https://elifesci.org/InnovationLeaders) 

We believe that openness is crucial to the future of research, and by supporting the community and promoting open-source research software, we can help build a culture towards integral, collaborative, open and reusable research. We hope to share some of our visions and learnings, and invite feedback and contributions from the wider open-source community on the next steps forward.

	                              yeah starting in this quote we have                               failed the internet the internet was                               built by scientists for scientists so                               that they can share their results with                               more people faster and easier the                               internet I think all of you would agree                               has changed the way that we communicate                               a lot of informations so I'll give you                               some examples and I'm gonna spend some                                time elaborating them so later you'll                                see you know sort of the contrast that                                exists between other types of                                information and research so for example                                looking at how you can find out about                                the scores of a football match a hundred                                years ago you probably have to wait                                until the match is over                                you read the newspaper the next day                                there'll be like a static photo some                                text and you get the score nowadays I                                just found out when I was preparing for                                this you actually get these sort of live                                streams on YouTube which is called                                    degrees video so while their matches                                playing life you could pan around the                                stadium and see whatever bit you want to                                you want to see from whatever angle you                                want so I think we can all agree that                                that's sort of a huge improvement from                                from that static image another example                                so I just arrived at this new city and I                                want to find out good restaurants to eat                                                                                                 guidebook there will be like a limited                                list of restaurants I'd be relying on                                the comments from this author of the                                book and then there will be an address                                and now I have to check another map and                                go there nowadays within a couple of                                seconds you can use your GPS and with                                the maps you can get all the restaurants                                around you you can get crowdsource                                reviews and ratings real-time you can                                filter the results by your you know                                dietary requirements or preferences and                                with another click you get instantaneous                                directions of the fastest way to get to                                that restaurant and that's that's really                                again a big change and what I'm about to                                tell you is the situation                                in how we communicate research so first                                to sort of step back you have to first                                understand how research is communicated                                nowadays so let's say I'm a PhD student                                working in the lab I do my research I                                spent hours and hours slaving over my                                experiments and then finally after like                                three four years I have some results I                                write them into the form of a manuscript                                I submit the manuscript to the journal                                the journal then has these editors that                                reach the manuscript sends it to what we                                call peer reviewers so these are sort of                                experts in my research fields who will                                be able to read my work critically and                                to give me comments so it will come back                                to me with revisions so these are                                comments on how you can improve those                                the work that I've done so I either I                                have to rewrite something I have to do                                some analysis again or some new                                experiments and then send it back to the                                reviewers and this happened a couple of                                times before we're happy that the work                                is worthwhile for publishing so then it                                appears on sort of this journal which is                                now a website used to be in print like a                                physical book I'm gonna point out some                                problems with this process at the moment                                in in a moment so that there are four                                main problems the first the first                                problem is that is extremely long so the                                average time from research submission so                                the the writing and submitting not                                counting the time for the research to                                actual publication on average at the                                moment it's nine months it isn't sound                                long but think think about a very                                relevant situation at the moment so the                                coronavirus that we've all been talking                                about the outbreak was discovered what                                was publicized in January so let's say                                for some miraculous reason the research                                was done in there within one day and the                                the researchers wrote everything up in                                one day as well and then they submitted                                to the journal and on that average time                                we would not have seen anything coming                                out from the research at this point and                                 we would not see it for another four or                                 five months and that's a big problem                                 because it means that this process is                                 stopping the communication                                 research in timely manner and it's also                                 a very very stressful process for the                                 people who are involved so an average                                 PhD student has about four years to                                 finish their research otherwise the                                 grant money runs out or you cannot                                 graduate etc etc and to think that you                                 know this while on average it takes nine                                 months for this submission process to go                                 through it can take anywhere between                                 sort of nine months to two years three                                 years I've heard and in the current sort                                 of research environment a publication is                                 crucial for their career progression                                 without a publication they cannot get to                                 the next step                                 to the next job and so this creates a                                 lot of stress it's called the publish                                 and publish or perish mentality which is                                 very unhealthy I used to be a researcher                                 that was the primary reason why I left                                 the third problem is that it's closed                                 what I mean by that is there's a lot of                                 discourse during that peer review and                                 revision process pretty much like if you                                 have that discussion over a pool                                 Crossland github that happens during                                 that process but in the end the only                                 thing the scientific community sees most                                 of the time is the published paper you                                 never see that discussion that happened                                 you never understand why a paper was                                 rejected or revised at any point you                                 just see the results so everything looks                                 perfect on the paper because you don't                                 see the the mistakes or anything and the                                 worst things the worst thing is                                 sometimes you don't even see the                                 publication because journals hold the                                 copyright over the publication and they                                 impose these things called paywalls so                                 institutions and libraries have to pay a                                 massive sum of subscription fees to                                 journals to be able to see those to be                                 further researchers to access those                                 publications even if it's their own and                                 imagine that if you are from an                                 institute without                                 much money you're basically barred from                                 that knowledge and that leads me to my                                 final point this process is extremely                                 expensive and it's extremely profitable                                 so the one of the biggest publishing                                 companies called Elsevier they're                                 operating margin last year was                                        put that in perspective the operating                                 profit margin for Google last year was                                                                                                         profits so much because it's so                                 profitable because you have to do the                                 journal doesn't pay the scientist to do                                 the research they don't pay the peer                                 reviewers to do the reviewing and                                 they're getting money from scientists                                 and institutions for reading the                                 research and for publishing and it's                                 ridiculous                                 and just to sum it all up I love this                                 analogy so it takes about nine months to                                 send a rover from Earth to Mars and so                                 what you can imagine if I'm PhD student                                 I would print out my manuscript attach                                 it to this Rover get it sent to Mars                                 have it like put the physical sheets of                                 paper on the surface of Mars use though                                 camera thingies on the top of the rover                                 to take images of the paper beam it back                                 to earth and that would still be faster                                 than publishing in the journal it was it                                 would be open because this is supposedly                                 government-funded and all the data that                                 comes back from those cameras can be                                 accessed on the Internet and it will be                                 cheaper and so you would have thought                                 that after all that money and time and                                 effort the way that the output of this                                 must be Stella must be something amazing                                 and the thing is that it's not so the                                 research itself is good but the way that                                 we communicate research hasn't changed                                 for like a hundred years okay yeah I I                                 have to admit that you know you there's                                 like links that you can click now and                                 like some resources theater set so you                                 can download for example but it's not                                 like we now have amazing interactive                                 figures                                 you can spin around in                                                 reviews that you can look at the ratings                                 of the reviewers so there's a lot of                                 room for research communication to be                                 faster to be more cost effective to be                                 more open to be more user friendly and                                 that is sort of the reason why my                                 organization exists so I'm the                                 innovation community manager Elife this                                 is our mission is on the wall of our                                 office we like to help scientists                                 accelerate discovery by operating a                                 platform for research communication that                                 encourages and recognizes responsible                                 behaviors in science we do this we're                                 funded by some of the biggest research                                 funders in the world so the Max Planck                                 Institute the Wellcome Trust Hughes                                 Medical Institute and the Wallenberg                                 foundation we do this by publishing some                                 of the best works in the life sciences                                 working with an editorial community that                                 allows us to do that fully open access                                 and online we do that by working very                                 closely with early career researchers to                                 and involve them in our governance to                                 involve them in the peer-review process                                 and to make sure that they can build a                                 research ecosystem that works for them                                 and we also do that by what I'm gonna                                 introduce next which is called the e                                 life innovation initiative so I leave                                 this initiative                                 it's a separately funded effort and our                                 mission is to drive open innovation for                                 open science so the belief the                                 fundamental belief here is that                                 technology can change our behavior and I                                 don't think I need to convince a lot of                                 people here that that's true I mean look                                 at the way that we've been using you                                 know our phones and Google Maps and                                 other types of innovation have changed                                 the ways that we've gone around doing                                 day to day life so our sort of                                 fundamental assumption and what we're                                 hoping is that by developing tools that                                 makes it easy to do the right things                                 when you communicate research it will                                 help drive more people to it                                 route so I've explained why innovation                                 is the is the approach that we're taking                                 but why open innovation what is open                                 innovation so I sort of want to contrast                                 two slightly different concepts here                                 which I think previous speakers have                                 also touched on something called opened                                 by default and open by the sign so I                                 learned a lot of these concepts from                                 Mozilla open leaders they're great and I                                 think a lot of this talk is borrowed                                 from various different places so just                                 bear with me so open by default is for                                 example if you sort of just put all your                                 code online without any explanation                                 without any descriptions or ways to                                 facilitate people start contributions                                 it's chaotic it's not easy to follow                                 open by design is that it's very                                 intentional                                 it's very strategic and the idea is that                                 it should be inclusive and open for                                 revision so if I'm a newcomer to the                                 field I should be able to find very                                 quickly and effectively how to                                 contribute how to get help and how to                                 recognize other people's and the people                                 in the contribution so what we're                                 striving for a tee life is open by                                 design type open innovation why do we                                 think this is important so if we forget                                 about the openness part and we just say                                 we want to make good tech that will                                 change behavior we can just ask the                                 publishers who you know already know                                 research communication super well and                                 can easily you know build tools that                                 will change behaviors and make life                                 people's life easier and in fact they're                                 already doing this so this is Elsevier                                 the                                                                     mentioned earlier this is their map of                                 how their tools and api's are linking                                 together some of the information systems                                 that are supporting research the problem                                 with this map is other than everything                                 other than the some of the bubbles on                                 the outside everything in the middle is                                 owned by Elsevier                                 and so we're basically by you know                                 looping researchers and trying to get                                 them to use this we're giving control to                                 this company and our user data and are                                 we sure that we want to you know hand                                 over this open the the chance to you                                 know change research to a company that                                 is making that much profit I'm not                                 entirely sure and the other thing is                                 that you know the way the reason why                                 research works this way at the moment                                 there's a big underlying cultural                                 problem and the current system is                                 facilitating it and so by using the same                                 actors to make to recreate the system                                 even with better technology those biases                                 are gonna persist and so I don't know                                 how many of you have seen this soap                                 dispenser video it's basically the point                                 I'm trying to make here is we need to                                 think about who is owning our knowledge                                 structure and who should own it we need                                 to put users and everyone a diverse                                 community behind the design of these                                 tools so that we are not propagating                                 biases that we don't want and another                                 sort of I think this generally applies                                 to a lot of tools open tools but                                 probably more specific to research tools                                 it's the reason that if a research tool                                 is not open it leads to the least to                                 people not being able to reproduce that                                 research so the example is let's say I                                 take as an image of a tissue with a                                 microscope if I don't own that                                 microscope I don't have money to buy it                                 I don't have access to it then I can't                                 read I can't take that image again so I                                 can't really reproduce or trust that                                 result because I don't manage to do it                                 myself                                 so this applies                                 to software if its proprietary a lot of                                 the processes and maybe data analysis or                                 data collection cannot be reproduced and                                 that is that that is an issue that's                                 specific to research itself so recap our                                 vision is to create open inclusive user                                 centric research communication tools                                 together with the community so how do we                                 do that I'm gonna sort of talk about two                                 things that we're doing at the moment                                 and constantly revising as we go through                                 and learn from the community so one idea                                 that we had at the very beginning in                                                                      was okay we have the researchers who                                 know this problem really well and are                                 very passionate about it but at the same                                 time they may not necessarily have those                                 tool development or software development                                 skills we need to put them together in a                                 room and give them time with people who                                 know how to develop products how to code                                 how to design etc and this gave birth to                                 the                                                                      took place in Cambridge UK we brought                                    people together for two days and let                                 them work on prototypes so going back to                                 my point about open by design the goal                                 of this is specifically to create                                 prototypes that are open inclusive and                                 user centric we needed to build                                 processes that would facilitate that and                                 so the whole sort of promotion of this                                 event and the the application process is                                 very deliberately designed so that we                                 could balance out the people who get to                                 get there this was last year                                             people coming from                                                       a lot of time getting sponsors to try                                 and get them to pay for people to come                                 from all over the world                                 we had a gender quota to make sure that                                 we achieved sort of                                 their goals and yeah we had a good mix                                 of researchers and in every one we we                                 only had two days so we need to get them                                 to know each other superfast so we had                                 lightning talks at the beginning we had                                 stickers to help them identify each                                 other we had a document before the                                 actual sprint where people pitch their                                 ideas and get a discourse going around                                 it we also used a document to ask people                                 if they need datasets for the for them                                 to create those prototypes and we load                                 those datasets into our AWS cloud                                 beforehand                                 we had a slight channel during the event                                 which we was projecting on the screen so                                 that people can see where what what the                                 projects needs help and where projects                                 are we provided everyone with sort of a                                 lean canvas to give them an idea of how                                 they could potentially structure                                 thinking about solution problem user fit                                 for their specific projects and then and                                 then there's any design sprints not                                 short of post-its so yeah so so that's                                 sort of like I'm sharing these thoughts                                 as we learnt a lot of those in the                                 community from the other community                                 events and I think we're not unique but                                 I hope that if you happen to be                                 organizing a hackathon or a sprint you                                 will be able to take some of our ideas -                                 so what did we create we really realized                                 that the best ideas come from the                                 community I'm not going to go through                                 every one of them I'm just gonna                                 highlight one particular one that is                                 very relevant at the moment but yeah                                 check them out they are you know                                 prototypes a lot of them got further                                 funding because of the prototypes that                                 they created at this hackathon with they                                 were able to demonstrate to potential                                 funders how what their visions are and                                 that they have put in some sufficient                                 work to develop a road map and a                                 wireframe and yeah                                 a lot of them are still in development                                 so the one that I want to highlight is                                 pre review it's a crowdsourced reviewing                                 platform for pre prints which are                                 basically on peer-reviewed manuscripts                                 so this was the coronavirus problem that                                 I was talking about preprints allow                                 these papers to get out before they are                                 peer reviewed so when I'm ready when I'm                                 ready to submit I can prep it my paper                                 and that instantaneously gets shared                                 with the world so pre review is recently                                 partnered with another open source                                 project called outbreak science and                                 basically this this particular project                                 came I mean they literally was so timely                                 it was that they partnered and then one                                 month later there was the corona virus                                 and so they really need help now so this                                 is a platform that they have developed                                 to get people to try and review some of                                 the pre prints coming out from corona                                 virus research and so if you do know any                                 scientists who can help like fill out                                    easy questions on how valid the research                                 is and how good it is please direct them                                 there and they also are hiring a                                 software development team to try and                                 help them out with platform development                                 so if you're interested just let me know                                 I can put you in touch ok that's all                                 great we developed a lot of prototypes                                 but everyone knows the problem with                                 hackathons the prototypes most of them                                 sort of just end there because people                                 don't have time because people even if                                 one person is super passionate they                                 don't the skills maybe they don't have                                 time and then it just sort of never gets                                 followed up on so I sort of spotted this                                 problem from the Sprint last year and I                                 was like is there anything I can do                                 about that how can we really empower                                 people to develop sustainable prototypes                                 and this led to the birth of another                                 program called alive innovation leaders                                 it's a                                                             mentorship training program for                                 developers developing opening prototypes                                 for research it's ongoing it's not                                 in February so it will end in May we                                 have                                                                     way from I think it's Melbourne                                 Australia to the west coast of the US is                                 all online what we do is we pair them                                 one-to-one with a mentor and we also                                 build a curriculum that covers arrive                                 for a wide variety of projects that are                                 needed to yeah be empower people to                                 create those sustainable prototypes so                                 I'm just gonna go in to that a bit more                                 so you start with sort of talking about                                 some of the things that we talked about                                 today value exchanges within the                                 community why are you equipped as an                                 open leader you move on to road mapping                                 and understanding users and                                 understanding problems and prototyping                                 processes and finally towards the end                                 we'll probably talk about sustaining the                                 project beyond the initial prototype and                                 getting that funding and marketing                                 efforts together so the we we do we do                                 cohort calls every single week because                                 of the time zone ahead to do two calls                                 every single week and it's a lot of fun                                 but we really learn a lot                                 so the whole pedagogy or the whole learn                                 idea of learning behind this program is                                 that there's a lot of discussions so                                 everyone sort of just goes into breakout                                 rooms this is all done by zoom so you                                 can sort people into rooms and then they                                 can have discussions and then they                                 report back and you write on the Google                                 Doc what you've you've talked about and                                 what you find interesting the amazing                                 thing I find is that you know after a                                 couple of weeks you thought like okay                                 it's just discussion and nothing                                 concrete's coming out but the sharing of                                 experience and the fact that you're                                 putting words down on paper essentially                                 means you're creating knowledge on the                                 go so we find that people are going back                                 to these documents when they're actually                                 working on maybe building user personas                                 or roadmaps                                 and looking at what other people are                                 saying and then using that as a                                 friends and so it it just works it's                                 it's pretty it's pretty empowering                                 because you once you realize that you're                                 actually in this part of the process you                                 realize that you may have the capability                                 to create something it's just a longer                                 explanation of sort of our how we make                                 sure that everyone can learn from each                                 other and apply that knowledge by                                 completing some assignments yeah so all                                 of this we're learning ourselves as well                                 as we're we're building this program                                 from our participants and what they want                                 and I think the flexibility that we've                                 designed and that the program is key for                                 its growth and for the participants                                 growth so two ongoing things what's next                                 here I'm sharing sort of some thoughts                                 that may be interesting to folks who are                                 thinking about developing communities                                 and yeah how to do it what are we trying                                 to achieve basically because this is not                                 your normal community you realize that                                 it's a bit different we're not trying to                                 get everyone to use a certain product                                 we're building what we're calling a                                 community of practice which essentially                                 means we're united by the goal a shared                                 goal of making research open and                                 inclusive this was when we asked people                                 on the survey on from the sprint about                                 what was the most valuable outcome when                                 they came to the Sprint and                                 unsurprisingly and surprisingly because                                 we we were so focused on wanting those                                 products but what people actually value                                 were other people so the connections                                 were way more important than what they                                 actually created again borrowing this                                 from what sale I don't know how many of                                 you have seen this it's really shaped                                 the way the mountain of engagement is                                 really shaped the way that I thought                                 about things so there's a sort of hit                                 word at the moment on Twitter but it's                                 called the architecture of participation                                 so how do you build an architecture                                 which allows different people coming in                                 with different expertise and skills to                                 be able to participate in the project                                 so what you want to think about is how                                 they would first discover your project                                 and then how they would build up their                                 initial interest to go step over that                                 over that barrier of the first comment                                 or the first issue or the first commit                                 through to you know sustaining that                                 participation and energy and then                                 finally having them being able to take                                 up that leadership role so the way that                                 at least for my vision for a life                                 innovation is that we support them                                 through the different stages of their                                 project building so they will maybe join                                 at the Sprint or when they follow us on                                 Twitter they will see the ideas of other                                 people they get interested they will                                 discover that there's a ecosystem out                                 there trying to change things they come                                 to the Sprint they will contribute their                                 little ideas and realize that it                                 actually can become prototype then they                                 may say okay maybe I can actually lead                                 this project now but what do I do                                 then they were join us at innovation                                 leaders and we will give them those                                 skills and values those skills and                                 connections that they may need to be                                 able to launch the v                                                     of that particular product so we're sort                                 of there at the moment and having gone                                 through the rest of it yet so this is                                 the next challenge is to think about how                                 do we reward people beyond just them                                 learning from each other and the                                 network's that they built is there a way                                 to tie what they're doing so researchers                                 if they're contributing to open research                                 software development is there a way to                                 give them credit in terms of their                                 career can we capture how much those                                 software are being used so that that                                 could somehow be reflected in whatever                                 grant application they're making next I                                 know this sound this all sounds like I                                 really love that to happen and I'm very                                 very glad that there are communities of                                 people who are sort of supporting us and                                 learning we're learning from each other                                 in that way so if you don't know already                                 check them out sustained                                 OSs working on sustainability of open                                 source software and chaos working on                                 measuring the health of open source                                 software communities so yeah                                 just learning and interacting with the                                 community and hoping to learn from the                                 bigger open source community because                                 you've existed for a longer time and I'm                                 sure that there are lessons that we can                                 take from there as well so thank you for                                 listening to this very long wine about                                 research and communication but I hope                                 you get an overview of what the problem                                 is and what a potential solution may be                                 if you'd like to join us at the next                                 print we are about to go out with an                                 announcement not now in about two weeks                                 time so that's link to stay updated same                                 for innovation leaders but later in the                                 year probably and I'm on Twitter and                                 email if you have any questions beyond                                 now but I'm happy to take it any                                 questions now thank you hi thanks for                                 your talk he talked about research                                 software and often IV in the examples of                                 stuff it was software which you need to                                 like peer review or something like so it                                 would be for me it's like software you                                 need to run the concept or the whole                                 process of research in general but often                                 research software is also like                                 simulation tools and stuff like that my                                 question now is are you interested Mayer                                 for the software which like supports                                 research in like the research process or                                 also like research software which                                 supports the research itself like                                 simulations and whatever yeah that's a                                 really good question Thanks um our                                 primary but our primary interest was in                                 research communication software so tools                                 that would change the way that we share                                 discovery evaluate and consume research                                 that being said when we open up for                                 example for the Sprint and also for                                 innovation the                                 we realized that a lot of people                                 actually wanted to use those locations                                 to develop open research tools so you                                 know very tied to data processing for                                 example very specific to a particular                                 part of the research pipeline and we say                                 why not because you know they benefit                                 from the same types of interactions and                                 architectures of participation and                                 expertise and so we've not say no and I                                 love personally to support that                                 community of research software                                 developers which is really growing and I                                 think it's really important that they                                 get recognized for the work that they do                                 which doesn't isn't happening now I                                 think I should comment that yeah exactly                                 there's a whole community rze it's                                 called and we also have that one in                                 Germany here I'm helping running that                                 also here in Berlin so yeah if                                 somebody's interested sorry for yeah no                                 I complete and all that so if someone is                                 interested RC communities are growing                                 they're also in the UK I think the                                 German conference is August                                             not wrong                                 yeah and then there's also the UK one so                                 this growing community is recognizing                                 that you know we need software for                                 research and hence we need people to                                 develop those software's and it's better                                 if they're done by people who know how                                 to develop your software                                 yeah and it's they have overlapping                                 goals like open sourcing stuff but also                                 making the whole process faster and more                                 transparent so I think it's really good                                 good join yeah exactly thank you yeah                                 great talk kind of a slightly sarcastic                                 comment but I'm guessing also fear must                                 not be a big fan of you know we're                                 friendly                                 well ish I mean they like yeah their                                 hope is model how are they dealing with                                 that are they what do you mean how                                 they're dealing with it well I don't                                 know if I were a big company making lots                                 of money and a group of people starts to                                 do something that undermines my pretty                                 much whole business and certainly my                                     in saying you know monopoly profits I                                 only hire some lawyers and start looking                                 at how to I don't know get rid of those                                 people somehow yeah are you saying now                                 I'm gonna get sued of this I mean I love                                 the thing that they are scared of the                                 things that are coming unfortunately                                 that's not really the case they still                                 have a huge Buy in from the research                                 community you think that after all the                                 stress and all the turmoil of you know                                 researchers going through this                                 publication process nobody will want to                                 publish without Sofia ever again                                 that's completely not true researchers                                 because because academic prestige is                                 everything and they've done such a good                                 job at establishing themselves at the at                                 the top of the hierarchy researchers                                 would kill to get a paper in Elsevier                                 journals it's a sad reality and that's                                 why you know technology as much as I                                 love it to change all the behaviors it's                                 sort of the facilitation platform for                                 all the cultural changes that can happen                                 on top it just needs to be sort of yeah                                 we are doing a lot of sort of community                                 work and understanding what can drive                                 people to get rid of that escape from                                 that status quo and do something                                 different despite the fact that you know                                 you may not be able to see the return of                                 that in a long time and it's again yeah                                 I'd really love for Elsevier to think                                 that you know we're a threat but in the                                 end we are really an egg hitting a wall                                 so we need more people in this basic                                 actually that was a very good way for me                                 to bring my question which was basically                                 okay so yes I think most people who'd                                 acknowledge what you say about Elsa                                 Viren                                 you know organizations like Elsevier                                 let's not make it specific but there is                                 a certain besides you know being the                                 gatekeepers they actually got to be the                                 gatekeepers for a reason which was you                                 know there is the kind of value in peer                                 review which is basically you know you                                 get qualified people to give you input                                 and so on and so forth so my question is                                 so how can you attract qualified people                                 to contribute in your platform and how                                 can you vet them that's a really good                                 question I agree with you                                             that peer review has value my question                                 is always why does it have to be closed                                 why can't this be in the open and why                                 can't more people participate in it so                                 think think reviewing a restaurant on                                 Google right you're not only asking                                 foodies to do that you're asking                                 everyone to do that and they're gonna be                                 spammers that are gonna be people who                                 are paid to do the reviews but in one                                 way or another we sort of manage and can                                 the same be applied to research maybe                                 maybe not                                 it is an experiment we are I think                                 different communities are sort of coming                                 to settling on different levels of sort                                 of vetting or accreditation for                                 editorial communities beside editors                                 themselves ultimately I can tell you                                 because research is so specific to a                                 specific field if I'm a PhD student in                                 looking at this particular part of the                                 brain in this particular animal I'm the                                 expert in that and not that many other                                 people are and so even if I'm junior in                                 my research career                                 I actually know quite a lot about what I                                 know specifically probably more than                                 someone who is working on a different                                 area of the brain in a different animal                                 so the question that we can never settle                                 on is what is a qualified reviewer and                                 then                                 if we can all settle on that does it                                 make sense to then make a barrier to                                 stop other people or the wider wider                                 research community from participating in                                 this peer-review process I don't I don't                                 see I personally don't see it I don't                                 think the barrier is fair my PhD program                                 I need to publish so can you explain                                 [Music]                                 yeah we have an impact factor we don't                                 like to talk about it but you can always                                 google it in fact if you type e life                                 into Google it automatically gives you                                 the impact factor which again is why                                 tools can really encourage bad behaviors                                 while we should really be moving away                                 from impact factors yeah so I think the                                 problem is that you have to start                                 somewhere where people trust you so                                 people need to believe that we're we're                                 serious and it's helped by the fact that                                 we're backed by serious people and you                                 know we publish high quality research                                 which the community generally agrees                                 that is high quality so this is all sort                                 of vague but it's true                                 and then we can start changing things                                 from that the problem is that if you                                 start from a grassroot process project                                 and you don't have that trust nobody is                                 going to take you seriously I mean it's                                 just a sad fact in in sort of the                                 research community and Beyond yeah so so                                 it's still very important we recognize                                 the value of our editorial community the                                 editors that we have our scientists and                                 they're all very well regarded in their                                 field so people believe what they say                                 are good papers but again going back to                                 that question I think this should change                                 because                                 you know the fact that someone Allah if                                 you know the peer-review process you                                 know that most of the time it sort of                                 just editors asking people they know to                                 review those papers and it's all based                                 on this nebulous cloud of knowledge in                                 the editors head which then it becomes                                 extremely subjective and so there's                                 definitely technology that we can use                                 especially with the web and all the                                 researchers profile most researchers                                 profile being available on the web the                                 technology that we can use to make that                                 a bit fairer and more inclusive and more                                 open I guess we're working on that as                                 well so yeah it's it's a tricky question                                 but the short answer is we're starting                                 with we're starting with sort of the old                                 ways of establishing trust but we're                                 hoping to change that using that trust                                 any more questions you're operating kind                                 of at the intersection of science and                                 research product development but also                                 just open source open communities and                                 I'm just curious to hear like what are                                 some maybe unexpected challenges you ran                                 into and like you know fusing these                                 communities or surprises or maybe like                                 positive stories that you would like to                                 share Thanks Oh positive stories yeah we                                 realized that people learn a lot when                                 they work on intersections so academics                                 don't or the academic developers they                                 don't necessarily have those design or                                 product backgrounds and so whenever we                                 put them together it's sort of just so I                                 remember the first time I heard about                                 design thinking and this echoes with a                                 few other people that I've worked with                                 as well is you know why didn't I                                 approach problems like this before it's                                 just a new sort of realization and then                                 yeah moving from an academic background                                 myself into a sort of more product and                                 software oriented company there are                                 things that you then immediately                                 realized that if only the academia took                                 out some of these learnings from                                 other communities they would have done                                 so much better and rather than using you                                 know papers to measure their output you                                 would you know use other outcomes that                                 you could define from the very beginning                                 and you would manage you would learn how                                 the time box your projects and things                                 like that and so so yeah so there was                                 another thing that I wanted to say yeah                                 so the other thing is that we also                                 realized that because researchers are so                                 prone to do like they don't like we                                 don't like to change so it's really                                 about making it super easy and sometimes                                 the metrics that you measure your UX                                 efforts against are not the immediate                                 outputs but rather the long-term                                 outcomes of what happens at the end so                                 this is like sort of an ongoing                                 discussion that I was literally just                                 having yesterday but yeah it's sort of                                 realizing what's special about research                                 software or soft open open source                                 research software and being able to                                 transfer some of those knowledge from                                 the border software development open                                 source space and make sure that we can                                 we can be informed as we develop these                                 products                                 [Applause]
