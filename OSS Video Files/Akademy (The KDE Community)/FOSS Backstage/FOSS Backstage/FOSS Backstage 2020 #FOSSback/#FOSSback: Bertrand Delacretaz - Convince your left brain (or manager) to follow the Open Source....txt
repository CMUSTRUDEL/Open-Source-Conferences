People are often motivated to contribute to Open Source projects by their "right brain" creative and “artistic” side, more than on a financial rewards or career ambition basis.

However, the “left brain” financial and career rewards of being involved in Open Source are tangible in many cases, benefitting both employer and employee, especially when taking a mid-term or long-term view.

Programmers become better by learning new tools, techniques and programming style from brilliant community members. Communication and organizational skills are also greatly improved by being involved in multi-cultural remote communities, where decisions are made asynchronously and most often in writing. Being exposed to quality software all the time, which is common in projects that build the foundation of the Web, also helps us raise the bar on what we consider good software.

All this translates to greater efficiency on the job, greater software quality as well as improved soft skills and team efficiency.

The benefits of contributing to Open Source are demonstrated in many startups and companies, for both employee and employer. If your boss is not convinced of that yet, this talk will help change that!

	                              hello so this talk is about how to                               convince your left brain to follow the                               open source path that you write for in                               desires and left-brain might also mean                               someone else like your manager will see                               that my name is Bethel ricotta                               I'm with Adobe in Switzerland I'm a                               principal scientist in the adobe                               experience manager team and I'm also                                very much involved in open source I've                                been on the board of directors of the                                Apache Software Foundation for a number                                of years and quite active in several                                projects and at the foundation level                                let's start by you know what's exactly                                this left right brain thing you probably                                aware of it but just to be clear the                                left brain is what's commonly thought as                                being the logic you know the rational                                part of our brain of our thinking and                                the right brain is more artistic for the                                creativity the the you know the only the                                impulses that the unclassified                                vague things that's the the right brain                                and we'll see how how both can work                                together and how open source addresses                                both actually open source contributions                                I would say let me start by by a story                                more than                                                        musicians Institute in Hollywood                                California a fantastic music school with                                great teachers but that was a one-year                                full-time program I did I was studying                                drums you can see me on the and there                                this yellow circle here at the                                graduation ceremony and there's four                                things that that I noticed about this                                experience that are pretty similar to                                what's haven't been happening to me an                                open source in this school there were                                there was a very friendly competition                                between players no you look at the                                others Oh today he played better than me                                and maybe tomorrow I can play better                                than him and it was all very friendly                                but you were always measuring your                                progress against the others and it was                                very you know very good incentive to get                                better and try to do try to do your best                                the second thing was making mistakes in                                public I did some very interesting ones                                in front of the whole cafeteria where                                people start looking at you what's this                                guy doing it's very interesting for your                                ego and then you also learn to accept                                that and fix them and there's a lot of                                Latino man sauce as well and the most                                striking thing for me about this school                                is how my my hearing improved I would                                listen to things that I recorded before                                school when I finished the school and                                and the mistakes were jumped in would                                jump in my face you know and before I                                might not even have heard them and just                                by listening to great players for one                                year my hearing my musical hearing                                improved immensely and that that's an                                interesting also parallel with open                                source and this also gave me an                                opportunity to travel the world you know                                move to California have a baby there                                those are interesting experience and and                                where you learn a lot and we'll see that                                there's a number of parallels between                                that and my experience in open source                                coming back to the to the brain thing my                                right brain wants autonomy mastery and                                purpose really you know I want to be                                able to decide what I want to do and                                must do things that I master that I'm                                comfortable doing and for a purpose I                                think that's pretty common aspirations                                it's not you know there's a great book                                about that it's not nice for me but I                                think that that's a that that match is                                my way of thinking about that the left                                brain wants food clothing shelter a few                                extras maybe but that's that's the basic                                thing you know it's more it's the                                rational aspects of the thing and can we                                demonstrate benefits to both sides from                                open source contributions I think we can                                and we see you know I'm thinking about                                my own left right brain but if you're in                                an organization like a company or an                                organization also has a right brain side                                more creative and a left brain side what                                we sometimes call the bean counters you                                know there are all the money aspects of                                 the company you need to make a living as                                 a company you cannot just do only fun                                 stuff so the left right brain analogy I                                 think applies pretty well to companies                                 or organizations                                 and I think yes we can demonstrate                                 benefits to both sides of this brain                                 either human brain or the corporate                                 brain the first thing that I that I                                 think happens in you know when you                                 contribute to open source projects it                                 fosters better programmers I have been                                 contributing to open source since the                                 early                                                                  and I think I've better big become a                                 better programmer through that and                                 really I didn't take any formal courses                                 or very few I learned by osmosis by                                 Lewin you know seeing what others are                                 doing seeing red code reading code that                                 have been writing learning in                                 discussions and you know when you when                                 you discuss how you're going to solve an                                 issue in an open-source project and that                                 that's been immensely beneficial for me                                 and I think it can work for others as                                 well there are several reasons to that                                 the first is that when you contribute to                                 open source it's often pretty serious or                                 critical projects I'm taking the example                                 of the Apache Software Foundation which                                 is the the organization that are know                                 best in this space which has about                                     projects today many of those are                                 industry changing or critical you know                                 if I could mention Hadoop for example or                                 Lusine or spark or the you know the HTTP                                 webserver which which powers a large                                 part of the internet all of these                                 projects are industry standards they're                                 critical they are very important and                                 contributing to that means you need to                                 do a good job plus it's in public you                                 know your your contributions are visible                                 by everybody so you want them to be good                                 and I think this Foster's you know put                                 the quality of the code and also the                                 there's the the same kind of friendly                                 competition that that I saw at my music                                 school well you know you're competing                                 against others to to write good code not                                 to be better than them but to do a great                                 job overall you know to make sure the                                 project is in really good shape and and                                 by seeing all these contributions fly by                                 with different styles with different                                 techniques you                                 not and and if you do mistakes in public                                 if you're in a healthy community they                                 will help you fix them you know they say                                 this code could be better please how you                                 could approve them and then you learn to                                 improve it and you become better so yes                                 I think definitely contributing to open                                 source makes you a better programmer                                 you're exposed to high quality code you                                 you know you you you refine it                                 collaboratively with others who might                                 have different ideas different                                 techniques and often you're exposed to                                 above-average programmers there's a lot                                 of excellent people you know CTO level                                 folks or people who have been doing the                                 complex things for many years so I think                                 that that's really that's really                                 applause as well and also I think makes                                 you happier because you get great                                 results you can see the impact of what                                 you're doing and that's the you know                                 that's the purpose part of the autonomy                                 mastery and purpose so yes I think                                 definitely contributing to open source                                 makes people better programmers I think                                 it also makes people better                                 communicators you know when you work in                                 an open source project it's a                                 multicultural environment it's remote                                 its distributed people are different                                 time zones different bosses different                                 cultures different mother tongues                                 there's a lot of diversity which makes                                 it harder to communicate and collaborate                                 and especially the asynchronous                                 collaboration techniques using                                 open-source projects are extremely                                 useful and an extremely valuable skill                                 to learn for a programmer you know in                                 today's distributing my work                                 environments that's something that you                                 need to have many companies today's                                 today are working in a distributed way                                 and you learn to express your programs                                 clearly and work in small manageable                                 units you know you have to break down                                 the problems in things that you can                                 explain to the community and that                                 someone can understand or validate it                                 and work with you on it                                 so that that's really that's very very                                 useful skills to learn these                                 asynchronous collaboration techniques                                 which are widespread and which have been                                 in a large pot invented in open source                                 projects I think I have another talk                                 about that which goes into more detail I                                 have a link at the end of this                                 this presentation if you're interested                                 so yes I think definitely contributing                                 to open source projects makes you better                                 communicators because you learn to                                 collaborate asynchronously in this I                                 call that low emotional bandwidth                                 environments you know when you                                 communicating in writing in email                                 mailing lists or in in tickets it's it's                                 hard to convey your emotions you can use                                 a few Smiley's but it's it's pretty hard                                 it makes the communication harder and it                                 sometimes leads to misunderstandings but                                 you have to you know you'll be learning                                 to work through that and that that's                                 very useful then if you later                                 communicating in them in a higher                                 bandwidth environment like in the                                 company you can use these skills and you                                 know take advantage of them to to to                                 more look serious I would say or more                                 efficient communication environments and                                 this again this also makes you happier                                 because it's efficient you get concrete                                 results so it will you know it's a it's                                 good for your for your happiness as well                                 which is an important part of this you                                 are in the more in the right way inside                                 but even if you think about left brain                                 you know manager or company wants to                                 have happy employees that's how you keep                                 people that's how you keep them                                 motivated that that's how you keep them                                 engaged so I think happiness is also a                                 very important aspect of these things                                 the third element that that I think                                 people benefit from in in open-source                                 settings is traveling we say we often                                 say that travel is the best education I                                 think it is it's it's you learn a lot of                                 things by traveling you don't                                 necessarily travel physically when you                                 do open source contributions you know                                 but your interactive interacting with                                 multicultural communities also have                                 another talk on this which goes in more                                 detail but briefly you know it's harder                                 to contribute within multicultural                                 communities if you come from a certain                                 place you're used to certain idioms                                 certain ways of saying things certain                                 jokes which might not work in a                                 different culture                                 so you have to adapt to that and it's                                 often harder to understand each other                                 when you when you're in a multicultural                                 environment especially with this low                                 bandwidth channels that we mentioned                                 before                                 so learning to do that will make you you                                 know more efficient in your work it's                                 kind of travelling without moving                                 because you you might be staying at your                                 desk but talking to many people from                                 different different cultures and                                 different countries different places                                 different companies which also have                                 their own cultures and I think it's very                                 it's very rich it's very enriching to                                 work in these in these environments so                                 yes travelling is great education and                                 working in multicultural environments is                                 a format of travel even if you don't                                 travel physically and then you can also                                 travel physically you know open-source                                 communities often they have meetups                                 which might be in your hometown so you                                 don't might not need to travel far but                                 still meeting new people or maybe these                                 the next town or maybe even the world                                 you might go to a faraway place - an                                 open-source conference and then it's                                 proper travel of course and you will                                 you'll learn from from that as well of                                 course this can be expensive not                                 everybody has resolved financial                                 resources to do that                                 but many organizations have helped can                                 help you do that like coming back again                                 - to Apache the Apache Software                                 Foundation Apache as a travel assistance                                 committee which is meant just for that                                 so if you have demonstrated merit in in                                 an Apache project you can apply to this                                 committee to have financial help for for                                 the Apache conferences not everybody can                                 be accepted there's a limited budget of                                 course but that's a great way to to                                 travel and you know be help you be more                                 efficient be more productive in this                                 organization so you will certainly also                                 get to actually travel with your through                                 your contributions so yes I think travel                                 is the best education as we say and I                                 think you will you can become a better                                 and again happier person by travelling                                 either actually to conferences or                                 virtually by just meeting these these                                 people in for multicultural                                 groans so I'm already at the the                                 conclusion which are called coda you                                 know based on my musical background and                                 I think yes contributing to open source                                 communities leads to better programmers                                 because you refine critical software                                 collaboratively with friendly                                 competition in open environments so                                 that's really a recipe for becoming a                                 better programmer again by seeing code                                 that's that's different from what you                                 will have written gives you new ideas                                 seeing tools that you might not be used                                 to and that you will learn these                                 environments and so on contributing to                                 open source also leads to better                                 communicators because you will learn to                                 collaborate asynchronously in                                 environments which are low bandwidth and                                 harder to communicate                                 than then in you know with physical                                 direct face-to-face environments so                                 that's very very useful skills and I                                 think it also can make you a better                                 person by this travel that we mentioned                                 working in multicultural environments                                 and traveling the world either virtually                                 or actually so I think that's three very                                 important points that you can hopefully                                 quantify for the left brain you know the                                 left side of your brain or for your                                 manager as we said so these are                                 important skills that can have an actual                                 concrete impact on the quality of your                                 work so thank you for listening if                                 you're if you're at first backstage I'll                                 be available for questions in the video                                 conference after this otherwise thank                                 you and there's a link here two more                                 talks about the topics that I mentioned                                 which are in my virtual press book thank                                 you                                 thank you now for any questions and                                 answers and I hope this works                                 hello hello can you hear us yes yes very                                 good and thank you for your talk                                 it was very good I'm gonna open it up to                                 questions so does anyone have any                                 questions for which one yep got one here                                 [Music]                                 thanks for the talk and do me at least                                 you touched upon some very obvious let's                                 say side side effects of contribution                                 contributing to open source my question                                 to you is I think most of the people who                                 are involved in one way or another in                                 open source would agree that these are                                 actually true the question is do you                                 think that there could or should be a                                 way to somehow measure those and                                 quantify those or I can think of a                                 number of reasons why that could be                                 useful but I wanted to hear what your                                 opinion is it is it's a difficult                                 measure you know you know asking people                                 how much do you think and you take like                                 I was saying like my eighties I haven't                                 I've taken very few courses but I think                                 that don't be one way quantify either                                 people indicated where they think people                                 think you have justice                                 I agree okay and we have any more                                 questions                                 yeah we have one Hey you talked about                                 this autonomy mastery purpose which are                                 these nice ingredients of intrinsic                                 motivation so we are seeing sauce                                 happening a lot not only in this kind of                                 volunteer context where you decide to                                 open a sauce but also in the company                                 context where it might be just part of                                 your job to do almond sauce so how do                                 you but what's your view on how you keep                                 this intrinsic motivation when not                                 working in a volunteer environment but                                 more in a corporate environment okay of                                 course which Canada can take and then                                 they have different phrases we're going                                 to technical and tactical mode where you                                 know you go to employ water                                 and the writings in the technical point                                 of view I think then that that has                                 helped me pretty clearly if you would                                 spend money could be okay and we sexy                                 one would like but we have and then they                                 have a different phrase if you want to                                 avoid any tactical dead and it's good to                                 have we Disney ironic thanks thank you                                 for the talk by the way can you see us                                 yes yes so but I have to look there to                                 see you                                 so talked about source or convincing                                 your manager in the sense that open                                 source makes you a better programmer                                 better communicator but how about the                                 argument that maybe open source also you                                 know helps the business itself like to                                 to reach their goals faster and to save                                 costs because yeah when you get involved                                 actively in your project that you might                                 actually have to like employ fewer                                 employees we can use you could just                                 influence the influence the direction of                                 a project with that be also a good                                 argument for the left side brain it's so                                 much no it cannot                                 I used the honey                                                         and it gave us reputation so I stole a                                 look at Kelly at the road                                 yeah so my what I was saying is really                                 focused on people poor people people
