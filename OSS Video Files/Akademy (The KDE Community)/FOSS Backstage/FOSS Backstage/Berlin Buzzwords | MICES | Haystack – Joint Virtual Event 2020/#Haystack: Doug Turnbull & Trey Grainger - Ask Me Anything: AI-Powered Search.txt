	                              hello good afternoon good morning good                               evening wherever you are we are now                               about to have a fantastic session and                               ask me anything on a I powered search my                               name is Charlie hull from open source                               connections and I'm also one the                               organizers of the haystack conference                               we're going to firstly I'm going to                               introduce our two speakers tonight's we                                have firstly Doug Turnbull who is the                                CTO of open source connections you may                                know him from being the author of the                                relevant search it was a wonderful book                                I even have it on my desk here and Doug                                pushes the boundary on what's possible                                with search irrelevance and works with                                many clients to really figure out how to                                help them best to achieve fantastic                                serger and I know Doug's been looking                                into the future of search and is                                contributing to a new book that's coming                                out soon from Manning called a I powered                                search and we also have trade Ranger                                Trey is used to be up until I think                                literally last week the chief algorithms                                officer at lucid works trey is a long                                and distinguished history in search and                                relevance and Trey's leading the charge                                on the AI powered search book I                                mentioned earlier and Trey Trey just                                before we get into this you've got some                                news on your your new direction don't                                you yeah hey Charlie you as you                                mentioned been Lucy worked for a little                                over four years and actually just left                                to start a new company called search                                colonel that is a search relevance a                                high-power search sort of consultancy                                and software development company got                                some exciting news coming up in the                                coming weeks or about that as well but                                but yeah it's gonna be a fun new                                adventure for me so looking forward to                                it okay so yeah I just wanted to I am                                afraid of having some trouble accessing                                the slack at the moment so don't do it                                do you want to give me a quick                                introduction perhaps as to                                well where you think the next the next                                big thing is with search where I mean it                                vectors what what's the next thing oh                                yeah we had a lengthy conversation about                                this open source connections retreat                                about where we think the future is going                                and I think it's an interesting                                conversation and I think you could talk                                about it in a couple of different ways                                one is the evolution of search itself                                and ranking so machine learning coming                                more to the front as opposed to being                                this sort of thing off in the distance                                that is often aspirational for a lot of                                teams and along with that I think comes                                a lot of sort of vector-based approaches                                to search the inspector specifically the                                voice search engine has always been                                sparse vector based indexes and how the                                two systems interplay in a single system                                I think is an interesting question and                                one that we're solving I think to                                another sort of direction is the extent                                to which the search UI is changing and                                how people want to interact with search                                results so in I think a lot of you see                                this with Google and I blogged about                                this recently if you search for                                something like the neverending story on                                Google you'll get a search results page                                with all kinds of different question                                boxes some of them are answering                                specific questions some of them are                                asking you if you want to watch the                                movie never ending story some of them                                are giving you an overview of the movie                                and I think it's interesting how the UI                                is evolving to almost solve anticipate                                the many possible intentions of the user                                and provide you many different search                                user interface and ranking experiences                                based on based on possible information                                needs you have and then finally I think                                another thing that we talked about was                                sort of related                                to the search becoming increasingly                                specialized so you have like things like                                question-answering where transformer                                models have been really transformative                                and you have ecommerce is being                                increasingly specialized in its own                                 right                                 you have many subdomains in search                                 ranging from conversational based                                 approaches to search to things that                                 verge on personalization and                                 recommendation systems and I think that                                 combined with the UI changes and                                 combined with how we're rethinking                                 ranking and search engines is really                                 gonna make the next five years a really                                 sort of revolutionary time in this sort                                 of AI powered search world so thanks                                 Doug                                 Trey how's the book going to cover this                                 and what's your approach with writing a                                 book and covering what's what's next in                                 the world a third yeah it's a good                                 question so you know I like oh you know                                 everything Doug just said the I've got a                                 slightly different take just in the                                 sense of how everything fits together                                 and I think the book will hopefully lay                                 that out nicely but you know                                 historically search engines have been                                 very much keyword-based like Doug                                 mentioned with the inverted index over                                 the last handful of years especially the                                 last five years there's been just an                                 explosion of innovation happening in the                                 NLP space specifically with the rise of                                 you know language models transformers                                 the stuff Doug just mentioned and in a                                 lot of ways most people are starting to                                 see that as the future of search just in                                 the sense that you know hey keyword                                 search is dead but you know these these                                 new models are better and they're going                                 to completely replace keyword search and                                 I I think it's a lot more nuanced than                                 that I think that essentially if you                                 think of the intelligent ways that you                                 can sort of piece together a search                                 engine and a high-powered search engine                                 you know keyword search is a key piece                                 of that and you especially need that in                                 the long tail but also                                 you know things like knowledge graphs                                 which have been used for years                                 you know sometimes auto-generated using                                 machine learning sometimes manually                                 generated really have a really important                                 place I think as well and in that                                 picture and the transformer models and                                 and and the density vector search                                 capabilities layer on top of that the                                 ability to understand language and                                 semantically understand a domain better                                 than some of those other approaches and                                 so I really think that it's about                                 piecing all those together as well as                                 taking both you know traditional content                                 understanding the understanding of users                                 and their behaviors and their actions in                                 terms of signals and also a really rich                                 understanding of the domain of the                                 business that your search engine is                                 serving going back to the the                                 specialization as Douglas missioning and                                 so in the book we sort of have it broken                                 up into sections and we're gonna walk                                 through each of those topics and one of                                 my real goals with the book is being                                 able to not just talk about these things                                 independently but to try to paint a                                 picture of how they all can interrelate                                 and be used together to overall build a                                 better systems that'll be the goal we're                                 still fairly early in on the book but                                 you know and and obviously the space is                                 evolving especially in terms of what's                                 happening on the the inspector and                                 neural search side of things but by the                                 time we get to the end of it I think we                                 will have that piece all reasonably                                 figured out and then you know within two                                 months of publishing the book I'm sure                                 the book will be outdated but that's not                                 a bad thing right thanks Trey I won't                                 embarrass you both by asking what the                                 book is going to be available I'm sure                                 it'll be available when it's ready it                                 will available as soon as it's ready yep                                 as soon as it's ready fantastic okay so                                 we've actually got a couple of questions                                 from the slack I'm just going to hop                                 over there we have a question from Tom                                 Bergman's thank you Tom who asks can a I                                 powered search replace for a part                                 traditionally tuned relevance or will it                                 only be effective after the traditional                                 tuning is maximized and maybe dark you'd                                 like to start answering that one yeah                                 sure so I actually think they are                                 you know I'm work I'm a queer consultant                                 so we like to think about pyramids and                                 maturity models and stuff I actually                                 think that one of the a lot of the                                 things that go into AI PowerSearch you                                 actually build by doing manual relevance                                 tuning a lot of the practices involving                                 building probably the most the hardest                                 problem that you do is how do you                                 measure search quality and so when you                                 even when you're doing a manual solution                                 and you kind of start simple right you                                 start with how am I going to like this                                 is a practice we go through with clients                                 here I've done nothing with their search                                 we say okay give me one area of search                                 that you think is terrible let's go and                                 gather some queries and just just start                                 I mean just start with some a dozen                                 couple dozen queries see what's good see                                 what's bad and then develop what we call                                 a judgement list so judgment lists is                                 basically you know which results are                                 good and bad for for queries and then we                                 tune those up manually I mean that's                                 always the starting point we tune this                                 up a bit manually we kind of go about                                 iterating on that and just seeing how                                 things evolve and what you find is if                                 you go through that process enough                                 you're gonna start to ask yourself the                                 question shouldn't I be using machine                                 learning to optimize this and you're as                                 you're going through this process you're                                 gonna ask a lot of questions you're                                 gonna ask okay so I started out by just                                 gathering maybe what my product person                                 or the marketing person thought were                                 good search results you really should                                 start to question that really early                                 probably and to say well maybe we should                                 go out and see how users are interacting                                 with search results bringing behavioral                                 signals they can bring in different                                 things like that and start to ask how                                 could we use this what other ways could                                 be used to measure and sort of make                                 those judgments more accurate how can we                                 our crease our maturity in that level                                 and then you might continue to tune                                 things manually but then you might say                                 this is a bit labor-intensive you know                                 I'm sitting here and we use Cupid for                                 this which many people may know about                                 I'm sitting here in Cupid I'm                                 I've got                                                                these I'm trying to improve relevance                                 and how can I do this let emission light                                 a machine take this over and I think                                 there's sort of two paths to go down                                 there I think you have you have the                                 foundation now now you can go in a                                 direction of within the search engine                                 maybe thinking about something like                                 Lauren's rank but I also think very                                 important is around the search engine                                 things like a lot of the work that you                                 may have done manually so basically do                                 some rudimentary intent detection or to                                 build rudimentary taxonomy and knowledge                                 graphs and then you can start looking at                                 building that out with some more machine                                 learning based approaches so all to say                                 I think they go hand-in-hand actually                                 and I think one sort of set you up for                                 success for the other fantastic thanks                                 Doug                                 try to do you have anything to add um                                 yeah so I I tend to start with the idea                                 so so like Doug was saying you uh what                                 often happens is people start they                                 install a search engine you know or                                 elasticsearch whatever it is they they                                 get it in production and realize that                                 they've accomplished a major feat but                                 the quality of the search results                                 doesn't look that good you know they                                 start having all these pet queries that                                 just don't work and then essentially                                 start one one at a time knocking out                                 tasks adding synonyms you know maybe                                 doing with stock words overly and doing                                 tuning of fields and boosts and all that                                 kind of stuff and then you sort of over                                 the course of several years eventually                                 meander two ways of doing all of that                                 with machine learning and automating it                                 often by that point the size of the                                 search team has gotten excessively large                                 and a lot of people are doing really                                 hard work that is hard to maintain so I                                 I actually tend to start with the idea                                 that some of these things should be                                 automated from the beginning because                                 there's now well-established patterns                                 for how to automate those things and                                 that way you can focus on the adding                                 domain expertise obviously not                                 everything can be automated but I tend                                 to start with you know there's always a                                 build versus by                                 aspect you know there's some commercial                                 software that can do this stuff                                 automatically there's you know like our                                 book that we're working on shows you how                                 to do it there's lots of tools and                                 techniques out there but I do think more                                 and more so that we're gonna see a world                                 where a lot of the automation of these                                 things is actually becoming commoditized                                 and much easier to do therefore people                                 don't start manually tuning they start                                 with at least some level of automated                                 tuning and then they go in and fix                                 wherever that you know machine based                                 tuning was off the mark great thank you                                 I know that we're quite there yet but I                                 think that's the direction we'll be                                 heading fantastic ok so we've got                                 another question from from the virtual                                 floor                                 Torsten has a question                                 when onboarding onto a high-powered                                 search how can I ensure that I don't                                 just optimize my local maximum for                                 example when judgments are based on                                 recent clicks so trade you want to kick                                 us off with that one oh boy it's a it's                                 a fun question so going to the example                                 you gave Charlie about the results and                                 clicks so let's say you're doing                                 something like learning to rank where                                 you are you know taking search results                                 learning from a judgments list which                                 results are good for any particular                                 query and then trying to optimize the                                 the tuning of your boost and whatever                                 fundamental algorithm or classify are                                 using to to rank the results if you do                                 something naive like you know take all                                 of the documents that were clicked on                                 and use those as an indication of a good                                 result and then start optimizing for                                 that essentially be the documents that                                 were clicked to become your your                                 positive ratings for learning to rank                                 you're going to get in a giant mess                                 because you do have inherent bias for                                 example people tend to click on things                                 in the top of the list even if they're                                 not the best results people and                                 documents that we're never seen you know                                 we'll never get any boosts and so sort                                 of manually creating those lists what                                 some people do                                 I'm going the ops the opposite end of                                 the spectrum where you are just taking                                 the results that people actually saw and                                 clicked on a is very problematic and so                                 that's where things like click models                                 come into play where you know instead of                                 just looking at what people did click on                                 you know there's lots of ways to take                                 the the click streams to actually figure                                 out of the clicks or even the documents                                 that were skipped over you know how can                                 you understand what the user was                                 actually intending and what they and                                 what they meant so like for is one                                 example a very common click model is                                 that this notion of using kind of a                                 click skip graph so instead of just                                 looking at which document somebody                                 clicked on you also look at the                                 documents that they skipped over for                                 example if they click on the first                                 document and they went to the you know                                 third document you know several things                                 you know they click the first one and                                 they kept looking you know that they saw                                 the second one and skipped over and went                                 to the third one and then you know that                                 they click on the third one and so                                 depending upon your domain and the kind                                 of search you're doing you might                                 interpret those actions slightly                                 differently but in general you know for                                 a common search use case you might infer                                 that result number three may have been                                 the final answer result number two                                 looked bad and result number one you                                 know was interesting enough to click on                                 but not where the user ended up and                                 based upon that you can use a model to                                 then train the learning to rank                                 algorithm I know you know there's lots                                 of other pieces of search in terms of a                                 local maximum that you might have to                                 look at because there's there's lots of                                 different AI power search techniques to                                 do everything from automatically                                 learning synonyms detecting                                 domain-specific phrases building a                                 ranking classifier for learning to rank                                 doing sort of semantic or statistical                                 query parsing to determine phrases and                                 to incur expansion through things like                                 the semantic knowledge graph but in                                 general if you're talking about click                                 signals and how you leverage those it's                                 really important to add some nuance in                                 terms of your understanding of what                                 those signals actually mean relative to                                 all of the other behaviors and actions                                 and I know Doug has studied a lot and                                 Todd and build a lot with with click                                 models as well I know Doug if you've you                                 want to add                                 more there yeah click bottles are great                                 because they overcome physician bias so                                 they're it's really one of their goals                                 is if you're if they know that there's a                                 sort of modeling of whether or not users                                 are examining results and if they're                                 examining how what proportion of them                                 are potentially clicking them and                                 examining is not just was the thing                                 rendered on the page is did this seem to                                 is this seeming to gather someone's                                 attention because many things can be on                                 my screen and I have many times missed                                 the button someone is yelling at me to                                 click right and so that that can help a                                 lot I think thinking about Orson's                                 question to there's also this other bias                                 which is presentation bias and this is                                 where you can get to it like a vicious                                 negative feedback loop with sort of                                 machine learning based search where you                                 know basically what you said right                                 people click on what they see they                                 continue to interact with those results                                 because that's what's who had shown to                                 them and our models learn that that's                                 those are the best results because those                                 are clicked on and this cycle just                                 perpetuates and this great result on the                                 thousandth page is never seen or                                 interacted with I think there's a lot of                                 really interesting ways to measure and                                 get at that and I actually think the                                 biggest silver bullet any search team                                 has or can conferring to bear is                                 measurement and I know what open source                                 connections the most mature search teams                                 that we work with they actually spend                                 about I would say                                                     resources actually on measurement and                                 maybe the rest on solutioning and it's                                 probably because they can have such                                 confidence and measurement that they can                                 then turn those that fantastic                                 foundation of training data into an                                 amazing machine learning based solutions                                 to search and what they what the best                                 teams I've seen do the most mature teams                                 they don't just have one way of                                 gathering say we use the term implicit                                 judgments that osc                                  distinguish between the explicit                                 judgments that you get into                                 they searched like truck-based relevance                                 challenges they don't just get like one                                 view of a click model and how its how                                 certain accuracy of different the                                 relevance different search results they                                 look at many sources of truth so you                                 might have a sense of what's relevant                                 for keyword based on another training                                 set or knowledge graph out there you                                 might have your a be testing as another                                 way of doing that you another you might                                 have some people will differentiate                                 between you do level of human relevance                                 testing or human SERP evaluation where                                 they're actually evaluating search                                 results page to say is this good or is                                 this bad in a lab setting and then                                 finally I'm really interested in the                                 field of active learning for this so for                                 those who don't know active learning is                                 basically the modeling basically imagine                                 your machine learning algorithms could                                 have a research question about their                                 training data so I have all of these                                 documents and all of these queries and I                                 have these you know we have all these                                 examples where when someone searches for                                 a movie there's a strong title match but                                 I have no examples of a weak title match                                 but a strong body match in this specific                                 context so maybe if I you know insert                                 into my search results in the third                                 result or something something of that                                 nature that would be an area I could get                                 a tremendous amount of gain on in my                                 training data with instead of just                                 randomly drawing something or throwing                                 it in there or trying to guess at Lasha                                 throw in there                                 I should really see where my training                                 data is weak and where I can get more                                 sort of signal on what's relevant what's                                 rel not relevant as another way to serve                                 combat that it's sort of basically work                                 on the biases in the data itself                                 directly yeah if if I could piggyback on                                 that a little bit the you sort of                                 introduced the notion of diversity in                                 search results a little bit I think that                                 you know I've spent a lot of time                                 working on with various customers and                                 problems on the Samana                                 take search and really trying to                                 interpret the intent of users in terms                                 of the words they're using and the                                 context in which they're using them and                                 I I get the question oftentimes and this                                 refers back to the original question of                                 hey so words can have different meanings                                 you know like I like to use the word                                 driver for example you know depending                                 upon the context a driver could be you                                 know a person who drives a car an uber                                 driver a truck driver it could be a kind                                 of golf club it could be you know                                 something that you need to install on                                 your computer for your printer to work                                 and so if you look at sort of the word                                 driver within the context of you know                                 C++ or embedded it takes on a very                                 different meaning than if you look at                                 the ever in the context of you know golf                                 or in the context of you know shipping                                 for example and so what's often the case                                 is if you go just run a keyword search                                 without having this semantic or sort of                                 knowledge graph based understanding you                                 end up with a set of search results                                 where result number one is a VM CDL                                 driver for a trucking company and result                                 number two is a golf club and result                                 number three is an uber driver and the                                 problem is that most people when they                                 type in driver they have a specific                                 meaning that they're thinking at the                                 time when you show results like that                                 they think you're an idiot                                 they look at the search results they're                                 all over the place and they they think                                 your search engine absolutely has no                                 clue what it's doing and the reality is                                 because you're doing a keyword match                                 those results all match the text but                                 it's much more important to match the                                 meaning so the question is how do you                                 display that to an end user and and                                 oftentimes if you think of you know                                 field collapsing or grouping kind of                                 capabilities you can actually if you can                                 hone in on those disambiguated meanings                                 and actually kind of group the results                                 based upon those and show the end user                                 either one hey we've chosen a specific                                 meaning and here's here it is and if you                                 want other meanings click here and we'll                                 show them to you or even in the search                                 results just show you know sort of a                                 couple of buckets or groups with the                                 different meanings so the user can                                 clearly see what you're doing there and                                 then                                 realize that there's multiple meanings                                 and they can either filter their search                                 results to get get at one or they can                                 just click on one of them and dive in I                                 think that you know that also gets to                                 what you're saying about being able to                                 take to be able to take other results                                 maybe further down in the list like                                 result number                                                         that it actually gets some visibility                                 when you've got multiple meanings often                                 one of those meanings will be shoved way                                 down the list and so if you can still                                 find the best result that takes on that                                 interpretation and show it I think                                 there's a lot of ways to both teach your                                 customers what you have available while                                 showing that your engine actually is                                 intelligent and understanding them and I                                 think that that's another way to kind of                                 end up boosting things that otherwise                                 might remain hidden                                 fantastic Thanks actually how do you                                 mention diversity there and I know                                 there's a panel later this week                                 I think Doug you're part of all on                                 diversity esse olds which we thought was                                 such an important subject we should get                                 lots of people talking about it so                                 looking forward to that so we've we've                                 got a another question from Mia when                                 when do you feel that neural search I                                 power search were whatever we want to                                 call it versus traditional keyword                                 search it's most useful and in which use                                 cases in particular do they solve who                                 would like to pick up that one right                                 thank you go ahead you want to go first                                 sir so I kind of mentioned a leader to                                 this earlier but if you think root three                                 essentially three different major ways                                 of interpreting a keyword that was typed                                 in you know one being just traditional                                 keyword search let me max match the text                                 one being more of a knowledge graph                                 based approach where you you take the                                 text you have some pre-existing domain                                 graph you know an ontology knowledge                                 graph where you can go look that thing                                 up and understand what it relates to and                                 how it relates to your domain and then                                 the third being this this neural search                                 or you know an embedding language model                                 approach you know                                 say I have a query like let's say                                 fast-food restaurants near Berlin                                 buzzwords or near Berlin let's say you                                 know traditional keyword search is                                 probably not going to do great with that                                 because it's going to try to look up                                 each of those individual words it's only                                 going to match documents to have the                                 word near in them and and it's not it's                                 not really understanding the logical                                 connection between the things in the                                 query a neural search approach is going                                 to understand what NIR means is going to                                 potentially understand what the                                 restaurant is and it's going to                                 understand Berlin but it's not                                 necessarily you know and it might be                                 able to solve a surface level question                                 like that but it may not necessarily                                 completely draw that inference if the                                 query gets much more complex than that                                 where you've got you know something like                                 you know hamburger restaurants near my                                 hotel at Berlin buzzwords there's no way                                 that the engine is going to naturally                                 understand the relationship between                                 those things from from a language model                                 so if you had a knowledge graph that                                 could actually pull in those pieces of                                 information and actually traverse the                                 graph you can draw a lot more relational                                 type inferences much simpler than you                                 would with a neural model which would                                 have to be trained in multiple there's                                 deep and really be able to do that and                                 so I would say that relational type                                 queries really need more of a knowledge                                 graph based approach more general                                 language queries so question-answer                                 systems or something that needs to                                 interpret and understand the the                                 semantic meaning of language or even                                 domain-specific language those are going                                 to do better with a neural approach and                                 then of course people just type in                                 random keywords or even you know lists                                 of things that are very specific and                                 their keys or IDs or things that are                                 really really far down the long tail                                 neither or boolean operators or any of                                 that kind of stuff neither the knowledge                                 graph based approach nor the neural                                 approach are really going to tackle                                 those very well and so I tend to think                                 that those are three different                                 ways of solving problems where you know                                 traditional keyword search is really                                 good with the long tail and does okay                                 with the rest knowledge graph is really                                 good with relational queries and                                 understanding domain-specific                                 relationships and then the neural                                 approach is really good with just                                 general language understanding and if                                 trained appropriately through transfer                                 learning or what have you also able to                                 dig into the semantics of domain but I                                 think you really need to combine them                                 even like Google when they released the                                 the the Bert's and they're released bert                                 into their search results i think they                                 correct me if I'm wrong Doug but I think                                 that it's only being used is it                                        queries actually leverage it it's                                 whatever query is over certain keywords                                 they said they said this is the largest                                 impact and they meant you said                                        our crews were impact but it was their                                 longest queries and so it was question                                 answering kind of queries yeah I've got                                 that news article here than me                                 politically doc what do you think that I                                 think it's I think it's interesting                                 because I have so many there's so many                                 dimensions to take this kind of question                                 one of the things you notice off the bat                                 when you look at any sort of trek                                 competition when it's getting started a                                 trek or one of these I our common                                 interface information with readable                                 competitions it's fascinating to me how                                 so many people will just start with try                                 be m                                                                pretty well and it's so interesting to                                 me how it's sort of like broadly above                                 average but not particularly amazing and                                 not particularly terrible and then                                 people try a bunch of things and they'll                                 struggle to beat be m                                                    for a given specific task they'll find                                 some model that is very tailored to that                                 task and it's very specific to that task                                 but it's not as generalizable or                                 something and as being like being pretty                                 bad I think that's really interesting so                                 people I think transformer models are                                 interesting because they seem to have                                 a niche in terms of being a bit more                                 generalizable but at the same time the                                 other thing I noticed is a lot of times                                 when you there was a really funny thing                                 on and this has been true my whole                                 career there's a really funny thing on                                 Hacker News which was like this word                                 does not exist calm and it was all                                 randomly generated the dictionary                                 definitions and I remember                                              people would generate research papers                                 with Markov models it's like you know                                 this will generate your term paper for                                 you just type in the subject and we'll                                 use a Markov model to generate some                                 gibberish and occasionally you would get                                 some interesting sounding sentences out                                 of it and I'm pretty sure the the                                 quality of the model                                 I'm sure the quality of the models has                                 improved since then but we do a lot of                                 cherry-picking of these things so when                                 you look at something like this word                                 does not exist calm you might see that                                 if you I don't know what the I haven't                                 done a measurement                                                      the terms are interesting but the rest                                 of them that are just like oh that was                                 weird let me just hit refresh so I get                                 something else that's interesting it's                                 hard to know why and it's hard to debug                                 why and I find like when you do search                                 relevance work or any kind of even                                 machine learning based work you often                                 want to know why things aren't working                                 and when you have a deeply complex model                                 that understanding that like ok we have                                 this class you might you know this                                 happens every time we work with the                                 client this happens it's like we have                                 this class of query that's extremely                                 challenging we don't understand why it's                                 not working how do we treat this kind of                                 query and if they all they had was like                                 a Bert based approach and they might say                                 oh trying to debug that would just you                                 know be a nightmare because people are                                 have a hard time sort of getting under                                 the hoods how these things work and so I                                 think I think we're gonna be in this                                 place where there's gonna be an ensemble                                 of techniques and just like the                                 diverse set of there's a diverse set of                                 information needs there's going to be a                                 diverse set of treatments for those the                                 information needs on the other hand                                 where I'm not sure and this is where the                                 future is hard to define is you know we                                 talk about a question because there's                                 lots of languages being appropriate for                                 a transformer model and this this might                                 segue into a privacy discussion that                                 Trey has a lot of thoughts on but what                                 if instead of just the question and we                                 move beyond keyword search and we think                                 about the whole everything we know about                                 the user their location their history                                 and we think about that as the input to                                 a deep learning model that I'm not sure                                 why a kind of complex you know deep                                 learning model wouldn't be appropriate                                 and then my final thought on the topic                                 is one reason that a keyword searches                                 it's still prevalent and most popular is                                 the technology is so commoditized it's                                 fast its super reliable we can scale it                                 to petabytes of data we can build on top                                 of these farce indexes all kinds of                                 sophisticated things like knowledge                                 graphs that get really close to solving                                 the problem Jimmy Lin had who is a                                 academic from the University of Waterloo                                 had a great paper it was you know sort                                 of I'm taking apart the neural hype and                                 saying house and she's a classic query                                 expansion gets pretty close to two Burt                                 based approaches he's since written an                                 article that says you know neural hype                                 maybe is is real at the same time if I                                 can have                                                                 on my boring solar elasticsearch cluster                                 why would I read and reinvent my soul                                 search system to be able to do sort of                                 an neural search based approach so                                 that's like many complex thoughts but                                 yeah the future is uncertain we will see                                 yeah any of that that leads into another                                 question I must apologize to a couple of                                 people whose questions I missed on slack                                 and I've caught                                 now but actually what you just said that                                 Doug you mentioned a couple of things                                 the yen's or James asks how to deal with                                 the need of explanatory transparency on                                 machine learning PowerSearch for example                                 when the seller wants to understand the                                 ranking position of her products in                                 e-commerce so here we got is this stuff                                 explainable yeah what do you think                                 go ahead sure do you want to go first                                 sure yeah um real quick to close that                                 thread out I did look at the article                                 you're right it was ten percent so just                                 to put the transformer models in context                                 Google invested tons in this and rolled                                 it out is the the biggest innovation in                                 their their platform in years and only                                                                                                  actually using these these language                                 transformer models and even of those it                                 doesn't help all of them it actually                                 hurt some queries like I know personally                                 I've gone to Google and especially for                                 long tail searches like I was mentioning                                 I'll type things in and just be                                 incredibly frustrated that I can't just                                 find the keyword I'm looking for because                                 I know it exists and I just want to find                                 Doc's with that keyword but the model is                                 just reinterpreting what I'm saying so                                 there's a long way to go I do think that                                                                                                      significantly over time but I think it                                 just reinforces that it's an area that                                 helps solve a certain set of problems                                 but it's not the panacea for everything                                 and I I do think that coming back to                                 this notion of explainable mae-eye or                                 explainable algorithms here in search                                 that there's a lot you know deep                                 learning is amazing and we're seeing                                 leaps and bounds you know more                                 improvements and tons of innovation                                 there over the last couple of years and                                 then we've seen in a while but the                                 models are in general hard to interpret                                 hard to explain which is a big problem                                 in search and so I think that we're                                 gonna see even if you just go back to                                 what I was describing earlier about sort                                 of knowledge graphs versus these deep                                 learning models I very much believe that                                 it's possible to translate                                 between keywords and vectors that                                 represent those keywords semantically                                 and knowledge graphs which represent                                 those keywords and and their intent in                                 terms of graph relationships there                                 they're not all three separate things                                 they're just three different ways to                                 model information and to the degree that                                 we can actually generate all three of                                 them automatically it very much seems                                 reasonable to me to be able to be able                                 to take keywords auto-generate knowledge                                 graphs this is something I've worked on                                 before with the semantic knowledge graph                                 to auto-generate                                 vectors that represent the semantic                                 meaning what was typed in this is what                                 Bert and the other transform of models                                 are doing right now and if you can auto                                 generate all three of those you can also                                 take the documents that connect them and                                 use them to interpret one in the context                                 of the other so I haven't seen a ton of                                 research or even by practical examples                                 of this yet but I much expect this                                 notion of explainable models to probably                                 become easier over time because if you                                 can explain one in the context of                                 another and one of them is explainable                                 at least partially not not a perfect                                 match but you can approximate it it's                                 almost like you're building a classifier                                 for the deep learning model to tell you                                 what kinds of problems that solved is                                 the classification I very much think                                 that's a I don't call it an easily                                 solvable problem but a solvable problem                                 and that will allow us to potentially                                 use the deep learning models as the                                 really complicated model that                                 understands everything and then to be                                 able to generalize it into much simpler                                 models that can be readily deployed and                                 much more easily control of and                                 explained so I think that's probably                                 what we're going as a field all right                                 thanks great so talk what do you think                                 how we get it feel to explain to people                                 why these models why these high-powered                                 models have yeah I think I think so                                 there's I think there's a lot of layers                                 to this I think one of the most                                 important things a search engine can do                                 is to reflect back what it thinks your                                 intention is                                 or or the things it could be more than                                 one thing I think Trey used a good                                 example with driver of here are the many                                 senses of this I talked about sort of                                 just searching for the neverending story                                 that seems like a straightforward query                                 but there are many things you could do                                 with neverending story watch it watch                                 clips just get a nerve you learn about                                 it and I often think that sometimes when                                 people want explainable ranking that's                                 that sometimes what is coming out of                                 that and I actually think this is an                                 area that is possibly areas around                                 intent detection and I see it that                                 itself is a huge topic it's not just                                 easily put into a bucket but what senses                                 of a term people mean is an AI search                                 problem that helps to that might be                                 deeply complicated to solve and I may                                 you can see a situation where I may not                                 be able to tell you why I think you mean                                 this kind of driver because you're a                                 developer but I can at least show you                                 that I think you mean software driver                                 and you might infer that's because I'm a                                 developer and then it's not a terrible                                 thing in that situation to be you're                                 completely transparent with the user                                 it's better than doing that and and                                 being clear that's what you think they                                 mean and letting them refine then then                                 doing that and then just being infused                                 and then I think sometimes within that                                 and I think this is probably what Yin's                                 is getting at is this idea of well okay                                  that's that's perfectly fine we have                                  people that their products and people                                  have this with SEO and Google I mean                                  it'd be great if Google told B why my                                  blog article showed up high for certain                                  things and not high for other things                                  they won't quite do that but for                                  businesses we run if many of the                                  businesses we run our marketplaces and                                  we are often satisfying suppliers and                                  sometimes suppliers our customers in                                  their own right                                  job search this is a huge deal and                                  people will come in and if they know too                                  much about their how things work they                                  might actually try to game the system                                  that's a huge problem in a lot of search                                  systems some blackhat SEO on the other                                  hand there's a there is value in                                  demonstrating people you know here are                                  the things that you can do right so you                                  rank high in our search results and to                                  give them a lot of transparency sort of                                  in a white hat SEO place because I do                                  think that sometimes the secret sauce in                                  a search engine is not necessarily the                                  technology but the human human and                                  organizational dynamics around the                                  search engine we're all working really                                  hard to make our content rank high in                                  Google and Google gut it does give us                                  information on what we can do to rank                                  high in Google and they do punish us                                  when we try to abuse the system so what                                  can we do I mean we can probably set up                                  an established set of rules and                                  standards and then instead of                                  necessarily explaining how the model                                  works we could say here's how in this                                  context here's how you're doing against                                  these rules and standards and Tre and I                                  both have some experience in job search                                  but job search is front and center where                                  you're like is your job posting high                                  quality did you list these kinds of                                  salary requirements did you are you you                                  know listing the skills in a clean way                                  that is gonna make things more                                  discoverable sure you probably had some                                  thoughts on on that I know from your                                  career builders game yeah yeah you used                                  to run search over Careerbuilder yeah we                                  spam or you know job posters wanting to                                  game the system so they show up at the                                  top of the results was constantly a                                  problem so you know we we built some                                  custom similarities for for Lusine that                                  you know essentially you know if you                                  think of the m                                                          classical tf-idf where you know as the                                  number of times the term increases in                                  the document this                                  or increases even when diem                                             increases just slowly I can't get into                                  the specifics but we definitely you know                                  if you crossed a certain threshold your                                  illness would actually decrease I mean                                  sort of a spam think of it like a spam                                  penalize err built into the ranking                                  formula because it was necessary because                                  you know depending upon which domain and                                  context you know if I've got a sales job                                  and there's you know millions of sales                                  jobs and I would be on the first page                                  you just put sales in your document you                                  know five thousand times and you're                                  going to be at the top of the first page                                  and so you know that though things like                                  that are easy to come combat but there's                                  also keyword stuffing where you you just                                  want eyeballs it's the the some                                  recruiters it's it's butts and seats                                  they just they just need as many people                                  to apply as possible it doesn't matter                                  about the specialization so yeah there's                                  a lot of ways there we're you know                                  machine learning classifiers can't can                                  really help in some of the situations as                                  well okay so sometimes you want to                                  explain things and sometimes explaining                                  things may be a bad idea depending on                                  the audience yep so we've got another                                  question here from Tomas we have is                                  implicit feedback data enough to train a                                  semantic search model and if not what                                  else can be helpful if you want to                                  exceed the performance of the text-based                                  search engine I think I think yes but a                                  I'd be interested because you I know you                                  are a passion of yours is building                                  knowledge graphs automatically yeah he's                                  very semantic search related yeah yeah                                  so so I have this debate with people all                                  the time about what semantic search                                  means you know semantics is just this                                  meaning so any kind of search where                                  you're better understanding the meaning                                  or the intent the users really semantic                                  search historically there's been                                  knowledge graphs is a way to solve that                                  more recently the Transformers and                                  didn't inspector stuff but if you peel                                  it back there's lots of different                                  specific problems I think of them as                                  building blocks that go into making a                                  semantic search system for example you                                  need to understand specific phrases so                                  that you're not parsing every key word                                  out as an individual piece of text but                                  you're understanding when words                                  or phrases and so let's take that one                                  problem how am I tied identify phrases                                  well I could take all of my texts and I                                  could mine my text and try to use but                                  first this is the improbable phrases or                                  any number of techniques to identify                                  phrases from my text but I'm gonna have                                  a lot of noise there the other way I                                  could do is I could look at my query                                  logs so if somebody comes in they are                                  consistently typing software engineer                                  over and over as a phrase then I can                                  from mine and my query logs and realize                                  that that is a domain-specific phrase                                  that I need to learn the meaning of and                                  I can add it to a list and that list can                                  be then be used so that anytime somebody                                  comes into the future they type in that                                  phrase I can identify this a phrase the                                  implicit nature of that if you're                                  talking about you know user signals and                                  what the users are doing is certainly                                  enough to solve that problem it also saw                                  with documents or you could solve it                                  with both and then look at the                                  intersection of what is both in your                                  content and also your users are                                  searching for and then you get a really                                  nice clean list that matches both the                                  supply and the demand that's one problem                                  take another problem misspellings so if                                  I want identify misspellings and search                                  I can look at my documents which are                                  full of lots of words and if I recommend                                  spelling Corrections for my documents                                  they might look a little crazy but just                                  with a lot of noise I could do the same                                  thing I can by my query logs                                  anytime somebody typed in ma nger                                  and then you know ten seconds or five                                  seconds or two seconds later typed in in                                  a in a ger so correcting manger to                                  manager because they misspelled tit I                                  can use that and build a machine                                  learning model that can automatically                                  learn spelling Corrections from commonly                                  misspelled terms from that implicit data                                  form for my user signals and that tends                                  to generate some of the best                                  misspellings correct spelling correction                                  list for given domain assuming you have                                  enough signals and I can further go down                                  that list you can look at you know                                  automatic query rewrites you can look at                                  synonym expansion identifying synonyms                                  you like you could sort of go through                                  each of these I'll call them NLP                                  problems there they're search in LP                                  problems you go through each of them one                                  by one                                  most of the time you can solve them                                  either with your content or with your                                  sick user signals and optimally with                                  both and so the short answer to the                                  question I think it's yes you can                                  absolutely leverage implicit judgments                                  to automatically generate these building                                  blocks that are necessary to build out a                                  semantic search system the higher you                                  set your thresholds in terms of number                                  of users running the searches and                                  what-have-you the higher quality goes to                                  the point where if you go really really                                  high then you have almost no noise but                                  you're missing a lot of inputs so where                                  I think the the human element happens to                                  come in there is if you don't have                                  enough signals you're gonna have to                                  augment it with with your understanding                                  if you don't have enough content you                                  know the same kind of thing but you know                                  I absolutely believe you can build a                                  semantic search system without a lot of                                  manual input assuming you've got enough                                  traffic and assuming that you've got                                  enough data if you don't have enough                                  data and/or you don't have enough                                  traffic then you don't have a lot of                                  options yeah I think I think I think a                                  lot of people once I think there's like                                  this sweet spot where there's a                                  combination of sort of an unsupervised                                  data source like Wikipedia or you know                                  maybe that's what starters start a point                                  for your own corpus and semantics that                                  might whatever semantic search assets                                  that turns into whether it's a knowledge                                  graph or like some vector based model                                  like Berger word avec that can be off to                                  be a good starter point for a lot of                                  people but the the real magic happens                                  when you can combine that with your own                                  query logs and behavioral signals and                                  you can draw connections between this                                  phrase we saw an interaction between                                  this phrase or concept which I might                                  recognize from like Wikimedia but in                                  this context that's connected to this                                  kind of document which may be in some                                  kind of vector space it clusters over                                  here which is a little bit different                                  than Wikimedia so you learn these like                                  almost geometric relationships between                                  the phrases in your queries and your                                  specific purpose which may be a little                                  bit different                                  then might what might be in like a                                  wikipedia or some other starter server                                  set that's almost like thinking about it                                  maybe from how you might start with a                                  simple word defect or glove or or                                  something like that I also think about                                  semantic search in terms of the                                  hierarchy if I'm thinking about this                                  purely from a text-based point of view I                                  like to think about this as as a                                  hierarchy and you people always start                                  with keywords we have keywords right I                                  think the next level what can keywords                                  is phrase detection to phrase detection                                  being sort of basic collocations like I                                  can detect that I could do compounding D                                  compounding I can detect common phrases                                  I can see that a I powered search is a                                  phrase without necessarily tying it to                                  any conceptual relationships I just know                                  there is a thing called a I powered                                  search and then I think you move up from                                  that and people will start to think in                                  terms of taxonomy Zoar manage                                  vocabularies which tend to be in my mind                                  hierarchical and where that has a lot of                                  you can you can learn these things and                                  it's funny because you know what do you                                  call machine learning what do you call a                                  I you know AI is what you call machine                                  learning and PowerPoint right a lot of                                  these things are just statistics and you                                  can find statistical patterns both                                  inquiries and and your own corpus that                                  that point at these things when you move                                  up to management Cabul areas or taxonomy                                  x' and you're thinking about things                                  hierarchically there are algorithms that                                  could look at this - I gave a talk                                  leucine revolution many years ago I                                  think it's called it's a mouthful I                                  think it's called taxonomical magical                                  semantical search or something but it                                  was about this concept of sort of                                  automatically deriving hierarchical                                  taxonomy as out of a corpus and grier                                  logs and those are straightforward                                  tricks just more or less based on                                  statistical significance and set math                                  right you can do a lot with simple math                                  and what's nice about even there is that                                  before you get into any complicated sort                                  of relational things between concepts a                                  lot of how people search tends to be in                                  this hierarchical fashion I think it's                                  really interesting that if you go to a                                  medical search engine and none of us are                                  doctors and what are we going to search                                  for to see if their search is any good                                  we're probably gonna tech cancer we're                                  gonna type I don't know                                  Tylenol that's probably not what an                                  experienced user of that system searches                                  and so what happens is we often strike                                  out with very broad queries that tend to                                  say that this high level of semantical I                                  guess you would say broadness a lot of                                  head queries are this way and we're                                  gonna you know we talk to started                                  talking about diversity and I'm gonna do                                  the diversity panel later this week that                                  I hope everyone comes to this is going                                  to be awesome but when you do that                                  initial strikeout query something that's                                  hierarchical can say okay here all the                                  senses of what that intention might                                  relate to and there are many ways of                                  thinking about a hierarchy of intentions                                  maybe different actions maybe it's                                  different concepts but cancer oh we have                                  all this stuff on you know all these                                  different kinds of cancers and you might                                  start to register in your mind you're                                  learning the vocabulary that the system                                  understands as you're searching these                                  broad terms and then you refine people                                  often refine more narrowly into more                                  refined narrower and narrower concepts                                  and as you get narrower and narrower it                                  becomes less of a let me show you all                                  that the possible intentions that you                                  might have and more about truly like                                  relevance ranking where it's like let me                                  try to get you close as possible to what                                  you're actually saying has that you've                                  seemed to really strongly knowing what                                  you want and then I think the next layer                                  in the hierarchy is the knowledge graphs                                  that you know trace sort of alluded to                                  before where you get into relational                                  inferences between different concepts                                  and all of these things I think the best                                  way to do them is a combination of                                  implicit data and I would say or                                  implicit data from your query logs and I                                  would say probably two sources of                                  of unsupervised text corpus data which                                  is something outside this your search                                  system because that might represent more                                  what the naive searcher is doing and                                  something related to your corpus because                                  that's going to get at what your at                                  least what the people who produce your                                  content think your search system is                                  about it's sort of the intersection of                                  the three things are often helping most                                  helpful or getting at at that most                                  common sense yeah I would say the                                  depending on the domain and how                                  specialized it is the referencing                                  something like you know the Wikipedia                                  corpus or you know any sort of external                                  knowledge based can either be incredibly                                  useful or incredibly non useful under                                  good point it yeah because the the words                                  can take on entirely different meanings                                  to depending upon the specialization so                                  if if you you know and I would even tie                                  this back to the transformer models in                                  some ways but when I think of the                                  vectors that come out of those models                                  they're essentially modeling two kinds                                  of things they're modeling the ability                                  to understand language generally and                                  then they're modeling the an                                  understanding of the relationships                                  between the text and the items that are                                  in the domain that the model was trained                                  on and so you take out of the box and                                  throw it in your search engine and it's                                  gonna do a really good job at in                                  understanding questions understanding                                  people places things general kinds of                                  linguistic relationships between things                                  let's call them but if you're dealing                                  with a you know you know if you're                                  dealing with bio you know biomed if                                  you're dealing with you know careers if                                  you're dealing with medical I get any                                  very specific domain if if the bird                                  model was trained on a general corpus                                  it's not going to do well at all in                                  terms of those things unless you do some                                  transfer learning on content from the                                  domains so I think that general rule                                  applies regardless of what kind of                                  technique you're using if you're                                  building a web search engine then                                  Wikipedia is going to be awesome                                  if you're building a very specific                                  finance vertical website it's gonna                                  probably be very misleading I think we                                  saw that just what quick comment on that                                  we saw that my colleague max Irwin built                                  a search engine using open source                                  connections blog and I forget what it                                  was that he searched for maybe you know                                  maybe it was solar I don't know if this                                  is it but you typed in solar and there                                  is definitely a bias towards light and                                  light based things because Solar Sol are                                  you know seem to be slightly tie to                                  solar panels and you know Solar is a                                  fairly unique term in our domain that                                  means nothing that the in the general                                  sense oh I thought that was there's all                                  kinds of stories like that that every                                  time it's funny yet we have the same                                  exact stories ten years ago when we were                                  playing with latent semantic indexing                                  sort of naively trained on a general                                  purpose - so it's it's gotten better but                                  it's sort of the same lessons                                  Frank's good thanks so I just wanted to                                  move on to another question here and                                  there may be a short answer to this one                                  there may be a lot of answers so a                                  teacher asks no matter of search is                                  powered by a I machine learning or                                  normal search isn't it true that the                                  data the source data that decides the                                  quality of your search so if the data's                                  not clean no matter what you invest in                                  you may never get your desired results                                  or do you think a high powered search                                  could could outsmart this do you want                                  take that dog would you want me to well                                  yeah if by data we mean training data                                  that's that's absolutely true I mean                                  it's very much garbage in garbage out if                                  we're supervised problems if we mean the                                  corpus itself well maybe I mean I I                                  think about basically the semantic                                  search conversation we were just having                                  and let's say I'm searching I'm                                  searching music by mood now you could                                  say is the are the songs bad because you                                  know Spotify                                  whoever didn't label them all by mood                                  and that is a bad data problem or is it                                  that we have to find the vector space                                  that maps between the query of the mood                                  queries and the in the audio and there                                  is some way to learn that a sad song                                  look that a sad song if we if someone                                  searches for sad and they click on                                  certain songs then we can you know sort                                  of get an association between that                                  concept of sad and a certain kind of                                  song that there seems to be some                                  commonality and then we have we solved a                                  data quality problem I mean you could                                  extend that to like really terrible data                                  that someone's put I mean another place                                  where people have data equality                                  challenges might the enterprise search                                  because enterprise search is kind of                                  always unloved by everyone who wants to                                  use it it's it's a place where people                                  will just write content they're not even                                  caring about it being searchable and                                  it's the same kind of thing where it's                                  like when someone searches for TPS                                  report okay what kinds of things are                                  they interacting with and can we learn                                  almost a relationship between a set of                                  queries and what a TPS report or a                                  report might even mean                                  so yeah yeah completely agree the I                                  think of search in a lot of ways is                                  supply and demand right the the demand                                  is the queries coming in from end users                                  and the supply is the documents you have                                  it's entirely possible to build models                                  that interpret the users query based                                  upon what they meant and then when you                                  go to actually execute the search you                                  get no results so you get very few                                  results so the this is still important                                  that your content itself is I would use                                  the word clean I would just say it's                                  there and you can access it and you know                                  that your model can map into it in some                                  way but yeah if you can't train the                                  model to understand your users intent at                                  all then you end up with the I'm just                                  going to throw some keywords at a search                                  engine and hope the bag of words in                                  diem                                                                  which is not an invalid approach it's                                  just a bit data at this point oh yeah                                  like optimally your models are clean and                                  your data is clean and then everybody's                                  happy                                  but sometimes you have to take what you                                  can get thank you thank you so moving on                                  we have a question from Filipe how do                                  you feel ai powers a high-powered search                                  could impact personalized search duties                                  do you see search get even closer to                                  real-time recommendations you want to                                  take that tray first I'll take it so I                                  think of so the goal of the search                                  engines to you know I guess academically                                  to MA you know help the user with their                                  information need right I think of it as                                  you know we need to understand the users                                  intent and then we need to you know                                  return results that match that intent                                  and so I think of user intent in three                                  dimensions the the content understanding                                  the user understanding of domain                                  understanding on the user understanding                                  you know somebody comes to my website                                  let's say I'm like Best Buy for example                                  somebody comes to my website and they                                  search for a you know they search for a                                  refrigerator and then they start                                  clicking on results and they click on                                  three different refrigerators that are                                  all stainless steel                                  maybe they click on five you know four                                  of them are by samsung the other ones by                                  some other brand and then they come back                                  you know an hour later and they search                                  the website for microwave should I a                                  return them a generic microwave or B                                  return them a stainless steel microwave                                  made by Samsung maybe all of the results                                  are exactly the same it's just how you                                  rank them the ones you show at the top                                  of the list I would argue in most cases                                  as long as you're showing the same                                  results moving the ones at the top of                                  the list that we believe the users most                                  likely to be interested in probably                                  makes the most sense if you're trying to                                  you know land a sale now there's nuances                                  of that you don't want them to then go                                  search for                                  i phone and then you know get a samsung                                  you know i samsung phone coming up                                  instead because we've learned that they                                  prefer the brand samsung you know like                                  so there's things like that you have to                                  be very careful about but the it when                                  you say AI PowerSearch vs. personalized                                  search i would actually say that                                  personalized search is a key part of a I                                  powered search so in the book there                                  there's a whole you know chapter in                                  section we talk about collaborative                                  filtering and real-time recommendations                                  and and personalized search that that's                                  that's a key aspect of what we're                                  tackling in the book and and really                                  focusing on of course how you do it but                                  more so how do you do it in such a way                                  that you don't mess up the other search                                  results like the the phone example I                                  gave you where you know we don't want to                                  return a Samsung phone for an iPhone                                  search because out of all of the areas                                  of a I powered search I would say that                                  personalization is the one where you're                                  the most likely to really mess up and if                                  your users angry because you're                                  personalizing the results to them but                                  they may not want that and especially                                  given the context it may actually make                                  the results worse and so so yeah it's                                  it's I think you should do it in a very                                  nuanced way that can help the user see                                  at the top of the list the things that                                  they are definitely the most interested                                  in while not overstepping to essentially                                  become recommendations that override                                  with users actually telling you yeah I I                                  couldn't agree more I think it's it's a                                  tricky area and I think especially as we                                  get into this world of being conscious                                  about privacy which I know Trey is an                                  area you're passionate about but I think                                  yeah I think I think a lot about the I                                  think a lot about it's nice when I see a                                  recommendation system and it's very                                  transparently a recommendation system                                  and it's it's this we have we have based                                  on your browsing history or similar to                                  this specific item or items like this                                  that we think you specifically would                                  like then it's like okay I'm logged in                                  to this website it has my history I know                                  it it what it knows about me and I have                                  a sense for what this piece of the UI is                                  is based on when I use search that's a                                  different proposition you                                  is what I it's like when I walk into I                                  mean every people use this metaphor a                                  lot but when you walk into a store and                                  you see the clerk and you say I kind of                                  want to know what you're you know show                                  me your washing machines or or what                                  maybe a better example to be fashioned                                  like I want to buy a sports jacket now                                  it's super important that they take you                                  to the sports jacket aisle and they show                                  you the I'm showing you this because                                  their sports jackets sort of a little                                  you know the gravy on top as if the                                  salesperson might somehow remember you                                  and and you have a relationship with                                  this person and they are able to sort of                                  maybe make some suggestions but you                                  wonder if a that should be called out                                  explicitly in the search somehow or B                                  that should almost be it like off to the                                  side as like a sidebar UI as like you                                  know as we were saying search your eyes                                  are evolving pretty rapidly right now                                  it's not just a                                                          like here's                                                             four hot links or whatever here's a grid                                  of sports jackets over to the side                                  sports jackets based on your browsing                                  history and I think a lot about if we're                                  reflecting back to the user that's sort                                  of an interpretation of their intent and                                  making that conversation very                                  transparent about here's what I put in                                  and I am I getting out what I want and                                  are they showing me are they explaining                                  why they're showing me what they're                                  showing me and if they start doing                                  something crazy then I'm gonna become                                  sort of increasingly distrustful of the                                  of the system not only from a relevance                                  perspective but also just from a trust                                  perspective Thanks                                  I love a question here that I think doc                                  maybe you would have made one for you                                  but John asked John Reith asks where                                  should a team starts in trying to get a                                  high-powered                                  what is the best point of entry and the                                  greatest value for the efforts where                                  should a team start yeah I think that's                                  a great obviously by your book                                  yeah by all the books you know I think                                  the for me I think one of the the                                  biggest things there's a lot of things                                  there's a lot of places you could start                                  I think one of the biggest things you                                  should be doing is thinking about the                                  pipeline between our users your users                                  interactions with search results and                                  translating that into sort of a ground                                  through set that's a great place to                                  start because you know that is going to                                  be the that is going to be the source                                  sort of the foundation of anything you                                  do a search you're gonna be able to                                  evaluate offline whatever crazy ideas                                  you have I think you're organism and if                                  you do that you can also another area                                  that I see people start that's not super                                  heavyweight and not super heavyweight                                  analytics is with really simple intent                                  detection and detection like I said can                                  be a broad broad category but simple                                  things like I know you want things in                                  this category because I see that people                                  often click this facet where when                                  prompted to do this thing they take this                                  action so I'm just gonna take that                                  action for you like that's like a really                                  simple training set for a pretty I mean                                  that's a pretty well solved NLP problem                                  for a long time we don't need                                  transformers even for that and I think                                  those are like those are almost like                                    bits if you started with those two                                  things then you'd have sort of the                                  foundation for with the with the sort of                                  the judgments and everything you'd have                                  the foundation for doing learning to                                  rank basically and then with the other                                  side you're starting to get the                                  foundation for doing more complex things                                  understanding queries and sort of the                                  sort of than semantic search side of                                  things almost and                                  that what you want that that's a great                                  place to get started the hardest thing                                  that you'll you'll find is when you get                                  to this place of thinking about machine                                  learning I often think when an executive                                  thinks about machine learning or you                                  know someone in a high-level role what                                  they really are thinking about is I want                                  to be extremely data-driven                                  in our company's thinking and machine                                  learning is sort of like by a definition                                  data-driven but I think as you get                                  started and start having successes you                                  can actually start to steer some of the                                  things that get in the way of machine                                  learning based search which is the                                  culture of the organization with some of                                  these things and this has been true of                                  search relevance not just is she                                  learning you know a high-powered search                                  you've you kind of have to get the                                  organization in this mindset of being                                  very experimentally driven because                                  you're going to find that you're going                                  to try some things you're gonna work                                  your you try some things you're not                                  going to work and it's got to be okay to                                  have the foundation for her trying and                                  experimenting and and failing and then                                  learning from your failures and then                                  moving on the next thing you want to do                                  that quickly and not spend six months                                  you know building something and then                                  getting into production realizing it you                                  know it failed at AP test yeah makes                                  sense and it obviously say to the you                                  know where should you start we obviously                                  you know as they said by the book and                                  for my marketing had on for a second I                                  think actually Manning that's a couple                                  of free ebook codes for the book so                                  maybe afterwards we can go through all                                  the questions and the slack channel and                                  you know give a couple of those out to                                  people so there's an incentive to post                                  some more good questions everybody but I                                  do think the other piece of it is with                                  any technology decision you you do have                                  a build purses by decision so you know                                  if you've got an internal search team                                  that's really good and you've got a                                  bunch of data scientists and they're                                  ready to go then you know look at the                                  book look at the techniques they're                                  develop your own techniques and hit the                                  ground running a lot of organizations                                  there's a small search team they don't                                  have the                                  the internal expertise and it's it's                                  hard to come by so you know I would say                                  reach out to somebody you know like an                                  open source connections or like a search                                  kernel or like you know whoever and they                                  can probably help you build you know the                                  third option is you know there's lots of                                  vendors out there building enterprise                                  software that does a lot of these things                                  already you know I I just came from                                  lucid works and you know they're their                                  fusion product does it you know there's                                  other competitors as well so you kind of                                  have to figure out what's best for your                                  business if you just want to put your                                  toe in the water and get started you                                  know we can definitely help with that                                  that the book I think we'll walk you                                  through that there's lots of resources                                  out there but uh but yeah it's um it's a                                  lot of fun and a lot of investment but I                                  usually in the end you come out much                                  better off by automating this stuff and                                  making your systems more intelligent                                  then by you know manually tuning and                                  building large teams of manual tuners                                  for years so in my experience I will                                  have actually just an additional comment                                  that I think when you have started your                                  journey talk about it talk about it I                                  suppose it's you know even if you're                                  starting the very beginning document                                  your mistakes                                  tell the rest of us how you're getting                                  on and come back to an event like this                                  perhaps and tell us all your successes                                  and failures because I mean that's a                                  hugely important thing that people need                                  to share their experiences so we can all                                  learn yeah yeah I'm sure both Doug and I                                  would would say that we've learned a lot                                  more from other people trying things and                                  failing and succeeding then you know                                  from our own failures and successes we                                  want to learn from you and also the                                  people who are best equipped often to                                  talk or write about something are the                                  people doing it in for the first time                                  and because after you've done it were                                  twenty years or however long you sort of                                  like it's become second nature to you                                  and it's like try and do I once I                                  recently had to explain some long                                  division to my son or something and it's                                  like oh I can know how to do this but I                                  don't know how to explain it but yeah                                  well it's a challenge a lot of us are                                  facing at the moment certainly yes you                                  know uh next question we have a question                                  a young man called Nathan day you may                                  have heard of he he says how do you see                                  the increased compute required for these                                  dense vector operations impacting search                                  and an interesting one is it a case that                                  small company might be left behind                                  because you'll need a certain scale or                                  budget before you can actually revise                                  the benefits yeah that's a I think                                  that's really interesting I think that                                  speaks to the you know the compute                                  question it's really there's a pretty                                  you know if I had maybe a good fun                                  interview question that I thought about                                  is telling someone to design a                                  nearest-neighbor data structure from                                  scratch if you want like one of those                                  sort of like half a day Google                                  whiteboard wake board interview                                  questions because it's a really                                  interesting question and what what that                                  problem is is I can like if we might                                  have a billion documents in our index                                  each of those billion documents might be                                  represented by a                                                         or something now if I wanted to take a                                  query                                                                     get the Billy the top ten documents out                                  of those billion that are closest that's                                  going to involve like if I just directly                                  computed that that is a direct scan of a                                  billion documents to do vector like a                                  cosine similarity or something or                                  Euclidean distance just to get like the                                  the closest things and then return those                                  now many of you may have seen many                                  people may know that there are sort of                                  re-ranking approaches where people will                                  first they'll search with like the m                                    and they'll say okay well maybe I have                                  some stuff in the ballpark I'm gonna do                                  this I'm gonna scan the top thousand                                  much like you might do with learning to                                  rank model that's very common and I'm                                  gonna bring up to the top of the best                                  stuff in there now I sort of think we                                  have that backwards I sort of feel like                                  we might the best solution is probably                                  first                                  to do something in that vector-based                                  world and pull back the candidates                                  because like I said ever since I've been                                  doing anything that's in this dense                                  vector space you can cherry-pick really                                  interesting good smart stuff but you can                                  also find like complete failures and                                  you're not entirely sure why sometimes                                  but you you almost like get this good                                  first set that's you know maybe                                  maximizes the recall of good stuff the                                  text based approach wouldn't get because                                  text search is too strict and wants                                  exact text message even even maybe even                                  after we apply our knowledge graphs and                                  our taxonomy and stuff and I sort of am                                  wondering if we have these switched and                                  so what a lot of people have been                                  working on for a while and they're you                                  know what Spotify has enjoy which is one                                  approach there's a hierarchical herckel                                  navigable what is it there's a lot of                                  graph based models are you know the name                                  of the algorithm transitive                                  I think it's NSF doing that net medical                                  hire in H naviga                                                       that has a very small world graph or so                                  each MSW yeah oh yeah well I'll go look                                  it up oh yeah yeah yeah yeah and                                  basically the idea is you know much in                                  the same way that for years we've had                                  this inverted index data structure that                                  could tokenize a document with the terms                                  and basically take a term and point out                                  every document that term occurs ax and                                  we can do that blazing Li fast and we've                                  seen is you know really you know burning                                  you know cpos go Brewer whenever leucine                                  runs right and and so we don't have                                  we're still working on that with with                                  sort of the dense vector approaches how                                  do we take a                                                            sort of put in a data structure so that                                  if I take a query                                                         it will efficiently do kind of look up                                  in that space and pull back ten                                  documents or under documents whatever                                  that are close and then maybe you know                                  maybe maybe this isn't how the world                                  works but then maybe we think about BM                                                                                                           learning to rank model or maybe it's                                  it's something else entirely or maybe                                  that's infants some other deep learning                                  model for Arirang 'king but I sort of                                  think I sort of think search                                  technologies are gonna are at this sea                                  change in terms vector search that might                                  enable that kind of future yeah                                  and to piggyback on that just for for                                  anyone listening who's not familiar with                                  how this thins vector search works                                  essentially you you have a field in the                                  search engine a vector field that is                                  representing some number of dimensions                                  it's usually like as a float you maybe                                  have like Doug mentioned                                                 have a field in the search engine with                                                                                                         the                                                                       you essentially can take you can take a                                  query and map it into another                                      dimensional vector and essentially what                                  you're doing is you're doing a                                  similarity between that vector a query                                  time of                                                                   query and the vector on each document                                  are potentially multiple per document                                  representing the the meaning there and                                  you're doing a similarity so cosine                                  similarity is very common which are                                  essentially calculating how how similar                                  are the vectors that are in the document                                  versus the query vector on that process                                  like Doug mentioned is very expensive                                  because if say you've got                                             documents in your index                                  there's no way to you know like with an                                  inverted index readers literally looking                                  up that postings list that has been                                  preached ener ated there's no way with                                  the the dense vector similarity to do                                  that you have to do essentially a scan                                  of all the documents and so the way this                                  is usually solved in the search engine                                  is by doing a nearest-neighbor                                  filter before you do that similarity so                                  essentially you know maybe it's clusters                                  maybe it could be any number of ways                                  that you you generate these these let's                                  call them clusters these neighborhoods                                  you filter down to the documents or the                                  the closest and then you only do the                                  similarity of those vectors on a small                                  subset                                  of your overall documents that's the                                  rear ankang step Doug was mentioning so                                  that's the typical approach that's                                  followed h & SW hierarchical navigable                                  small world that's what it is is one                                  example that the intends to be near the                                  cutting edge where you can actually                                  encode those those neighborhoods into                                  the index itself that something is being                                  worked on in Lucien right now to make                                  that filtering and then the rear inking                                  just a much more seamless operation one                                  of our one of our wonderful colleagues                                  in the slack has just posted some                                  references to that so thank you so the                                  answer is yes it's going to be expensive                                  if you're smart you can probably reduce                                  the expense

                       elastic open distro as there a n n                                  algorithm approximate nearest neighbors                                  elastic has there x-pac edition

things there are                                  also things outside of the Lucene world                                  like Vespa I know I think hands out is                                  how you say his name is working on a                                  search engine koujina ji na which is                                  supposed to be neural first there this                                  is one of the reasons I'm sort of                                  fascinated we're at a pretty important                                  inflection point search engines and I                                  think we may have a broadening might get                                  a flowering of new search engines which                                  i think is is exciting and actually                                  really promising yeah I was going to say                                  two things one on I saw in the the slide                                  channel I think a shim that was asking                                  about the vector capabilities coming to                                  Toulouse seen sort of what they mean so                                  though I think those originally                                  were came from a lot the elasticsearch                                  implementation one thing I will say you                                  know they don't start like a flame war                                  here but the actually fundamentally I                                  don't like the notion that a document                                  like a field in a document just                                  represents one vector of meaning need                                  I'm working on a patch for solar I'm a                                  just with work transitions and stuff                                  haven't worked on it much in the last                                  month or so but hopefully I'll get back                                  to it at some point but the the approach                                  I'm taking is think of it more as a                                  multi value vector field so you know                                  when I'm representing a document as a                                  vector I'm essentially taking all of the                                  content in that document and generating                                  one vector of numbers that represents                                  the document but the reality is instead                                  of thinking of it as you know a document                                  vector you can think of it I just like                                  the generic term a thought vector and to                                  me a thought vector could be a vector                                  that represents the entire document it                                  could be one that represents you know a                                  paragraph or you know even a sentence or                                  individual words so if you think that                                  each word could be represented as a                                  vector maybe phrase reach paragraph if                                  you could have a multi value vector                                  field then that would allow you to when                                  you match from a query to documents not                                  have to match the entire document and                                  sort of its averaged meaning but to be                                  able to actually match specific parts of                                  documents that might matter more than                                  others and so the the implementation I'm                                  working on on the solar side right now                                  is essentially allowing multiple value                                  among multi valued vector field which I                                  think gives a lot more opportunities in                                  terms of the way that you can actually                                  represent the content so I hopefully                                  whatever is being built into we've seen                                  I'm sure it will start with you know one                                  vector per document like the elastic                                  implementation but I hope that as things                                  are being built out we can mentally                                  think of a model where they could                                  actually be multi valued fields and                                  that's that's not super hard at the                                  vector being represented and and scored                                  for the the rear ankle piece as                                  I've mentioned but when you start into                                  things like embedding like like H and SW                                  embedding in the core index structure                                  the way a vector is represented I think                                  it gets a lot harder if we don't think                                  about upfront being able to support                                  multiple values or multiple vectors I                                  should say in the field and if we get                                  sort of in a rigid model of thinking                                  that there's one vector per field within                                  a document I think that significantly                                  limits some of the things that as an                                  industry we need to be able to do in                                  this space in the coming years so just                                  throw that out there I'm not sure                                  that'll start hopefully some other                                  conversations but I think that's a                                  really well that makes me think of                                  almost makes me think of highlighting                                  like we could have highlighting snippet                                  ranking where we have a vector around a                                  paragraph and yeah like this pair okay                                  here's a score for maybe there's a score                                  for a document but there's also a score                                  for the paragraph of the document and                                  I'm now I'm imagining I don't know if                                  David smiley still working on                                  highlighters but his head might be                                  exploding thinking about how we gonna do                                  vector based highlighting but we'll have                                  to figure out how to rank snippets with                                  vectors potentially there's a lot of                                  really interesting applications and and                                  we without having multiple values per                                  field within the documents we cut off a                                  lot of them so just want to throw that                                  out there okay sounds very cool and I                                  can see going off inventing stuff so                                  yeah yes so I'm gonna just give you one                                  more question then is that there's                                  something we've got I know you want to                                  talk about as well but Daniel Daniel                                  asks when building personalized search                                  how do we assure the implicit user                                  context doesn't interfere too much or                                  too little with the intent of the search                                  that are specified in the query this                                  goes back to the personalized search                                  discussion from earlier probably Doug                                  you want to take that one yeah the the                                  how do you do it maybe that's that's                                  more that's more interesting in a way                                  because                                  if you have a lot of implicit                                  information about the query or about the                                  the user or the query that that might                                  actually I almost think about that                                  instead of changing how we might                                  interpret the query itself or how we                                  might rank documents itself it changes                                  how our understanding of their intention                                  and you know if we just had the query                                  and let's say the query is especially if                                  the queries a broad query we might show                                  a diverse set of search results and                                  similar to what we talked about with                                  driver before if all of a sudden its                                  driver plus I know it's Doug Turnbull                                  Doug is a software developer and you                                  know once wrote C code blah blah then it                                  might return Linux drivers or something                                  I may even know that I once read a Linux                                  driver book you know hopefully not ten                                  years ago or something and I I sort of                                  feel like it's it's in that it's in that                                  realm of like tweaking our confidence                                  and intentions where we make these                                  decisions and there are cases actually                                  where more context like that driver                                  example might really be strongly                                  influenced the M you know our                                  interpretation of the NB or the query                                  but then when we have very very specific                                  queries where it's like Linux driver                                  book O'Reilly it becomes really                                  challenging to you sort of have to scope                                  any interpretation of the intention to                                  that to that query and there's a lot                                  less ambiguity so in some ways                                  personalization how much value is there                                  in personalization in that place maybe                                  there's a little bit but you definitely                                  get in the spectrum of like I might do a                                  little bit of tiebreaking with                                  personalization but I have a really                                  strong understanding of what this user                                  means and it's almost fun it's it's                                  probably not going to be even worth                                  trying some oddball interpretation of                                  what                                  so yeah personalization is almost like                                  you're baking a cake and adding some                                  vanilla extract you know you want to be                                  very light with you know were you yeah                                  you add if you put too much you ruin the                                  whole thing okay okay I wanted to just                                  take a little diversion because it's a                                  subject close to your house which is                                  when we know that Google and other large                                  tech companies now collect a huge amount                                  of information about us and and to make                                  you know it makes our lives more                                  convenient and it has in personalization                                  but there's been a backlash against this                                  and not everyone's happy with the amount                                  of information that's collected and                                  these a lot of this information goes to                                  power could go to power a high-powered                                  search so how do we address this                                  conflict now how do we build a a I                                  powered search and still respect privacy                                  yeah don't you mind if I take that one                                  yeah go go for them so yeah it's it's a                                  it's a hard challenge so you know on the                                  one hand we've got content and you can                                  search on content but we've talked a lot                                  about user signals your user behaviors                                  what they're doing what they're clicking                                  on building models based upon that both                                  in the aggregate and even to some degree                                  on the personalization front and not                                  doing that not not interpreting user                                  behavior significantly handicaps your                                  ability to provide you know an                                  understanding of their intent and                                  ultimately the best search results that                                  being said most people don't like their                                  information being collected they want it                                  to be protected what have you so I've                                  actually been an advisor for several                                  years to a company called presearch it's                                  sort of in the blockchain space it's a                                  decentralized web search engine so the                                  idea essentially is you've got Google                                  and and I do and Bing and those search                                  engines and DuckDuckGo what we're trying                                  to do is build a decentralized search                                  platform where people can run nodes and                                  and there's no sort of there's no                                  centralized control of the platform one                                  of the key tenants and in my view is if                                  a you know nobody's going to be able to                                  go out                                  hire enough smart search engineers and                                  data scientists to ever be able to                                  compete with Google but what you can do                                  is you can try to open source and                                  democratize the ability to build out                                  search for the world and so I think of                                  it as you know it's still early phases a                                  lot of the technologies in early phases                                  being built still but the idea is that                                  eventually you have a platform where                                  people can be rewarded and incentivized                                  there's a whole token economy and what                                  have you I won't get into but it can be                                  rewarded and incentivize for their                                  contributions to the platform so people                                  who contribute code or new algorithms                                  the platform essentially becomes a place                                  to test how well those perform and                                  ultimately to be able to you know have                                  people be rewarded for the contributions                                  so in you guys so here's ok I'll just                                  keep talking I see so the so that's the                                  idea so I've been working with them and                                  one of the key tenants is this notion of                                  privacy and so how do you how do you                                  have a world where you know you can both                                  collect user information and be able to                                  personalize search results without that                                  information being collected by it you                                  know a single central authority and so                                  one of the ways that that I'm thinking                                  about it and we're you know still                                  working through this is you know imagine                                  if you went to let's just take Google                                  imagine if you went to Google and your                                  searches weren't logged by Google but                                  they were actually kept in your cookies                                  or you know somehow locally they were                                  encrypted using your own keys and they                                  could be used to help personalize the                                  search but without you know any you know                                  centralized party or other party you                                  know having access to them so there's                                  very much transient information and even                                  your IP address and all those kinds of                                  things are restricted so some of those                                  things were actually trying to solve on                                  pre search and I'm you know gonna be                                  able to spend a lot more time working                                  with them you know in the very near                                  future but yeah it's a really hard                                  problem because I you know some people                                  like DuckDuckGo you know they take the                                  perspective of hey we're not going to                                  log your searches and that's just how we                                  work and how we operate and great that's                                  great for privacy but you do handicap                                  yourselves in terms of your                                  to improve and so I I really am very                                  much thinking along the lines of how do                                  we keep the benefits of personalization                                  while removing the risks and downside                                  it's of some company or even government                                  having access to those things on an                                  ongoing basis so that I do really                                  control my data and can do whatever I                                  want with it and including not                                  collecting it at all yeah I almost I                                  almost wonder about you know Trey I                                  think you put a lot more thought into                                  this I have but I almost wonder if in                                  the spirit of like end-to-end encryption                                  is there a way that I truly can own my                                  data where I'm not an encryption person                                  we need to get an encryption person on                                  here but where my where the search                                  training data going to build whatever                                  machine learning model can somehow be                                  turned off by me at you know by clicking                                  a button and I can have some full                                  confidence and trust that that has                                  actually happened because I think as                                  organizations we're in a tricky position                                  because we do need a lot of implicit                                  information from our users and frankly                                  as much as we want to be privacy                                  obsessed I think almost everyone who's                                  not you know extremists about this is                                  wants the convenience of things being                                  personalized for them so it's you know                                  if I go on to some if I go to Netflix I                                  know what it's doing I know what it's                                  what I think I know what it's doing                                  which is part of the problem what I                                  think when I think there is especially                                  where it gets really tricky is I wonder                                  to what extent we have an ethical                                  obligation even when users don't ask for                                  it and even when users are can are sort                                  of convenience tie us not asking them to                                  put front and center like maybe I mean                                  I'm not I don't necessarily want to call                                  out Google that they are like the                                  billion dollar gorilla in the room                                  I'm almost imagining I wish there was a                                  checkbox under Google that was like                                  forget                                  you know I mean I know I can go to a                                  kognito mo to get this but eh I know and                                  I know I can dig into the settings and                                  probably do this and maybe trust that                                  Google is gonna do that do you like do                                  the right thing but literally a show me                                  everything you know about me that is                                  going into the search delete everything                                  you know about me forever or you know I                                  could just turn it on and off and be                                  able to sort of have some fine control                                  over that and I know that sounds                                  annoying and I know that like I'm not a                                  UI designer and I shouldn't come here                                  search UI so it was probably a better                                  way to do this but I sort of wonder if                                  we have an ethical obligation as search                                  teams to be thinking about that level of                                  transparency and I feel like I'm saying                                  this in everyone you know you might your                                  head you might think I'm crazy but I                                  sort of feel like as this these issues                                  are evolving I think a couple years from                                  now this is gonna be even more front and                                  center and people are going to be even                                  more aware of all the things like I just                                  think about all the things all the                                  things that Google might know about me                                  whether it's Google Docs I've written or                                  email or all the Google Analytics every                                  site I've owned or all that information                                  like how can I know and where is it                                  going and as much as I want us to have                                  this you know uninterpretable AiAi                                  powered search future I sort of think it                                  needs to be balanced this                                  interpretability question must need to                                  be balanced by like that okay what is                                  going into the search and how can I                                  control that yeah completely agreed I                                  mean it just this past week Google was                                  all in the news for tracking users in                                  incognito mode I don't know all the                                  details so I saw that that's right                                  probably blown out of proportion I                                  haven't really dug into it but I mean                                  even when you go into incognito mode you                                  know when you go to Google they still                                  collect your IP address they still                                  collect your search terms the only thing                                  you're doing is not persisting your                                  cookies and so you know it's essentially                                  up to us and this isn't thinking at                                  Google but you know anybody any search                                  engine this essentially you know you're                                  giving them all the information about                                  yourself and your queries and you're                                  trusting them to you know keep it in                                  confidence and you know not do anything                                  malicious with                                  but the reality is you don't have any                                  control over that and so I you know I do                                  think there's there some ethical                                  obligation on our part as people working                                  on search to not take advantage of our                                  customers and our end users and to                                  respect privacy and all those kinds of                                  things so but the reality is today it's                                  the user information and signals are                                  very important to delivering a good                                  search experience and it is way too hard                                  to collect them in a way that is easy                                  and a hundred percent and not going to                                  be abused it's just way too hard to do                                  that and so most companies don't have                                  commercial reasons to add those                                  protections in and less mandated by law                                  but I that doesn't mean we shouldn't be                                  thinking about it and trying to solve                                  the problem regardless of how hard it is                                  you know maybe we can come up with some                                  solutions that make it easier for                                  everybody it's related to another                                  ethical problem I think that a I powered                                  search or search in general basis and I                                  think grant talked about this a lot in                                  the keynote earlier today where we can                                  so easily get into our own echo chambers                                  and this is if we think about                                  information retrieval broad more broadly                                  than search and we think about things                                  like social media news feeds mm-hmm and                                  we think about things like you know even                                  search results I'm sure are this way                                  where I am so often I I was you know                                  I've been waking up I've been having                                  trouble sleeping in recently and instead                                  of googling the the objective what                                  impact does summer have on sleep or                                  something like that it was I wanted to                                  confirm my hypothesis I wanted someone                                  to write that early you know and I'm you                                  know this is probably true but early                                  morning light is definitely the cause of                                  why I was having sleep problems or                                  something like that and it's a lot of                                  people's searches are really about                                  confirming hypotheses mm-hmm and I think                                  the sort of the personalization of                                  search and all that sort of it really                                  forces that echo-chamber that that were                                  we're all in and especially when things                                  to I think grant said this really well                                  when things are very a session and                                  conversion based we lose that broader                                  perspective of the information need of                                  of you know Doug just needs to be a                                  well-informed sleeper or something like                                  that or Doug just needs a call as dr.                                  mine my doctor's phone number should                                  just pop up or something like that so                                  said our industry sort of faces these                                  and I do feel that if we're in this                                  industry world benefiting financially                                  from having these skills I think we need                                  to think about an advocate through the                                  piece needs to our employers agree                                  yeah really important and also if you                                  can ask Google to delete delete that                                  query of your yeah what we've got we've                                  got another question here from Daniel                                  we're running out of time for this one                                  Daniel says searches a lot about                                  educating the user with all this magic                                  happening or factors how much how might                                  serve still fulfill this promise yeah so                                  don't mentioned earlier let's take an                                  e-commerce example like when somebody                                  comes Doug mentioned the walking into a                                  department store and asking for a you                                  know a sports jacket or what-have-you                                  earlier um there's lots of different                                  kinds of intents that people have when                                  they come to run searches right so                                  sometimes there's more of a browse                                  intent where somebody's just looking to                                  see what you have available but not                                  looking for anything in particular                                  sometimes somebody might so so in that                                  case they might type in sports jacket in                                  other cases they might type in like a                                  UPC or your products you or even like                                  the specific name or ID of the product                                  that's that's more of an intent for them                                  to buy meaning they they either buy or                                  they know specifically what they're                                  looking for they don't want you to be                                  smart and do anything you know they                                  don't need neural search they really                                  need you to match an ID or a name and                                  bring them back the one thing they're                                  looking for you know in that case                                  they're probably looking to purchase or                                  they're you know maybe checking the                                  price or something but it's a very clear                                  intent of I don't need to educate them                                  right now on other related products                                  necessarily what I need to do is show                                  them this product and help them make a                                  decision about this product and in the                                  former case there's a huge incentive to                                  need to just generally educate them                                  about you know the topic in the latter                                  case it's more about trying to close the                                  sale and there's everything in between                                  you know the user might type in support                                  or you know like in a they might be                                  looking for like if it's in enterprise                                  search use case they might type in PTO                                  policy or something like that and so                                  sometimes and I would even go one step                                  further you know say it's a telecom                                  company like your mobile phone company                                  and somebody types in pay bill in that                                  case they're not looking for information                                  at all they're looking to actually take                                  an action and so that's where things                                  like chatbots start to get integrated                                  and so I think that the the notion of a                                  search engine as something that just                                  like brings me back a list of                                          links is very dated at this point I I                                  see the idea of search giving you access                                  to information sometimes you want                                  documents sometimes you want to bring                                  back a specific answer maybe a snippet                                  pulled out of a document sometimes you                                  want to redirect somebody to a chatbot                                  or to a customer support and so I think                                  search is really becoming the the center                                  the central point or focus of how we                                  interact with digital information and I                                  personally I see things like search                                  engines recommendation engines chat BOTS                                  like I see this whole spectrum actually                                  converging over the coming years as                                  opposed to those things being separate                                  systems I see hopefully from an end user                                  standpoint it's a seamless experience                                  and not naughty they're not even                                  thinking of it as search they're just                                  thinking of it as let me find                                  didn't do the things I need to do and so                                  you know go vector searches is a key                                  building block like all the other things                                  but I think that well at the end of the                                  day information retrieval is about                                  understanding the users intent                                  delivering on their information need and                                  information needs I think over the last                                  few years have just evolved to be much                                  more than ten blue links they've evolved                                  to be helped me learn find and act upon                                  whatever it is I'm trying to do right                                  now and so that's that's kind of where                                  my thoughts are Doug yeah it's really                                  hard to like answer that question                                  without a specific application in mind                                  like if you were a chatbot how you would                                  say that you understood what the user                                  needed and built trust with them you                                  might ask them oh is this what you mean                                  do you want to cancel your airplane                                  reservation something all of us may have                                  been through recently and or if you're a                                  question answering system literally like                                  Google Google will do this if it's this                                  is really interesting and I think this                                  is like a interesting baby step to                                  question answering where you see they'll                                  like quick answers you get question                                  answering you get quick answers and if                                  you type a question and you like scan                                  through the quick answers like oh I                                  recognize this question this is really                                  what I mean                                  that's built a link between your query                                  and that and so in the future when                                  enough people search for that and they                                  sort of clarify that's what they mean                                  then we a question answering and we will                                  know with some confidence that oh this                                  is actually the answer to the question                                  we've been able to measure that and                                  every - every one of these sort of UI                                  footprints is different important if                                  you're an e-commerce often it's very                                  much about comparing contrasting and                                  what are the factors that matter when                                  you search for television versus when                                  you search for shoes and can you show                                  that in the UI and can you know maybe                                  there's a little bit of personalization                                  to know this user is going to care a                                  little bit more about this factor so I'm                                  going to show that in the UI I almost                                  think it's independent of the underlying                                  solution                                  to some extent at the end of the day                                  it's sort of we it's it's the                                  intersection of sort of the product                                  expertise the engineering data science                                  and the and that in the UX of like user                                  asks a question and can we reflect back                                  to them the real understanding of what                                  they need and sort of the information                                  they need to take a further action okay                                  well I'm going to bring us to a close                                  there firstly I'd like to thank to the                                  Clara Clara's people I know working in                                  search today Trey Grainger and
