Imagine a shopper searches for "coffee". The search results mindlessly repeat brand name, ground coffee over and over. Technically relevant. But not very useful. Not mixed in are results appealing to a different kind of "coffee" searcher:  organic coffee, whole bean, espresso, or related coffee equipment. 

Beyond relevant results is Result Set Diversity: providing not just technically correct answers, but a diverse (though still relevant) view of what's possible in the search system. Showing our grocery searcher that we might, after all, have something they want.

In this panel, we'll discuss Result Set Diversity in search. We'll hear from teams working to summarize for users the diverse array of options available to them given their query. An ideal search experience helps provide next steps, broaden the user's understanding of the content related to keywords, and cover the user's possible, unspoken intent.

Join host Doug Turnbull and search practitioners, Andreas Wagner, Felipe Besson, and Lev Gershenzon, as we hear experiences measuring & solving Results Diversity, with a panel discussion on the Result Search Diversity problem.

	                              as I'm the first one in this barrel it                               will be an introduction                               talk and yeah well first of all a couple                               of words about myself and our company we                               are doing Product Search Search                               recommendations and catalog navigation                               solutions so as you can see we're quite                               a small company but still have a                               significant amount of queries in                                different domains and so this diversity                                issue is a challenge they have to take                                on so well I must confess that in my                                talk there will be more questions than                                answers but this is a list of questions                                the positions I I'd like to to touch and                                a bit to talk about and we'll start with                                the air with the question what's what's                                actually the problem and yeah with the                                diversity so well if we consider                                ourselves or our search engine as this                                dog so this is a simple situation where                                obviously I know the list is needed so                                we see how user the task is clear just                                go and fetch what you've been asked on                                but more often the situation can be like                                this then we should retrieve at least                                two sticks in different colors or even                                like this when not just well a number of                                different sticks I need it but maybe you                                can see a tennis ball can also be useful                                and sometimes when a query is brought we                                can you can retrieve like a huge pile of                                totally different different products and                                the question will try to answer or at                                least approach to is how to organize                                this pile and how to make it useful for                                our users so the first question is                                we are actually what are the sources of                                the of diversity so yeah and there are                                three main sources                                the first one is ambiguity and with the                                situation where same words can just be a                                different meanings and the question we                                have to ask is what what object was was                                meant when user typed in this query the                                second the second source is in                                incompleteness so well sometimes we can                                understand what what object is being                                meant but there are too many various                                types of objects for example if we are                                talking about coffee machine were vacuum                                cleaners there are different sorts of                                them and we may be not quite sure what                                what exactly kind of product the user                                meant and the another type of this and                                completeness may be that even if we                                understand quite clearly what object was                                meant we may be not sure about the                                intent so what about this object is                                interested it is interesting for for                                users and of course we have different                                people different users they may mean                                different things and even one person the                                same person we mean and were at                                different tasks using the same words so                                let's have a look at a Google search                                page for a broad query the Lima we can                                see here yeah we know that this this                                word can be can mean a donut it also can                                describe a resident of Berlin or also in                                German it can be an adjective referring                                to the city of bullet and as we can see                                on this page we have this three meanings                                represent                                doughnuts doughnuts we have even to                                Wikipedia definitions we have two                                sections about Berlin and one is the new                                section and another is it risk                                information and also one example                                referring to the president of book and                                in terms of intense we can see a                                dictionary definition new section                                recipes images                                yeah the statistic information queries                                and answers                                so quite quite wide range of different                                intents is coming on or only on this one                                page and yeah another thing is that                                Google isn't it isn't quite sure in what                                language you engage with me so we can                                see the results both in English and                                German but let's have a look at some                                examples in e-commerce and we choose for                                ya like our following users journey and                                teachers marketplace it's called Larimar                                plots it's the marketplace where                                teachers can sell the materials for                                others teach for other teachers to buy                                them and to use them in class yeah that                                 can help conducting their lessons so                                 let's have a look and let's try to find                                 out what one single word one query like                                 faster water may mean first of all we'll                                 try to see what other queries containing                                 this word are in our log yeah well on                                 this this light we can just notice that                                 it's a really huge really long tail but                                 we were interested in define were in                                 finding out the meaning or the meanings                                 and in terms of this first query so if                                 we have a look on the top most frequent                                 queries containing this word                                 it can identify at least four different                                 objects for different meanings for                                 different objects that are of interest                                 to users maybe for different users the                                 like what a cycle physical states of                                 weather water colors and something                                 having to do with saving water were                                 using water yeah and but when we think                                 about maintaining or automatically                                 identifying these objects we may take                                 into consideration that they Iraq a lot                                 of formally different ways of expressing                                 once a median so these are some examples                                 for the physical states of water                                 enjoyment                                 another question we're talking about is                                 about intent or in this case type of                                 material because well for different                                 lessons for different teachers may be                                 different types valuable and we can see                                 even in the top lists mentions of                                 experiments or some researchers books                                 and this types of materials can also be                                 found in the filters section we'll talk                                 about about it a bit more later and                                 there are some some other important for                                 making a choice parameters that are also                                 can be expressed explicitly expressed in                                 in this query so this is about the type                                 of schools like primary schools grades                                 and water were as a null Jean in some                                 other domains like grant can also be                                 directly demanded in in the queries by                                 the users so we just had a quick look on                                 the text of queries that we and                                 simplifying the situation consider as                                 formulations and this source of                                 information about where we can find some                                 perfect                                 patience for the meaning of the words it                                 corresponds to the query box and query                                 suggestions section section but it's his                                 source it's it's a tool that users use                                 when they are somehow very disconnected                                 and satisfied with the results and they                                 just decide to reformulate to ask                                 another question another source is                                 filters I would describe the situation a                                 bit different when the user when users                                 are somehow satisfied with the results                                 but they have they see too many noise                                 and they just simply by clicking on some                                 facets of filters want to refine the                                 results but the most may be valuable or                                 and even very difficult source of                                 information is just the dispersive                                 interactions or so called passive                                 interactions of users with search                                 results like quick said to cards and                                 purchases and of course every a commerce                                 project aims to increase the purchases                                 and purchase or transaction is some sign                                 of a successful session but well know                                 some problems with the source like this                                 data is very biased by the current                                 search engine and it's maybe sometimes                                 hard to properly norwich these three                                 types of interaction interactions but                                 still we can't miss it because well it                                 adds a lot to just looking at the text                                 of the queries and we can see here some                                 distributions of most important for                                 making a choice in this domain and                                 characters so here are some subjects                                 tags and also material types and waters                                 and what if we had a bit more time what                                 we could notice that                                 this lists the stop lists of parental                                 values different here in the search                                 results distributions from the list that                                 we saw analyzing the text of the queries                                 the reformulations and there's no                                 surprising here because well as we                                 already mentioned the nature of this                                 data is is is different but now if we                                 phrase this complicated task to merge                                 the information about the possible                                 meanings or intents from all the                                 available sources sources we may have a                                 kind of profile with the weights or                                 maybe even probabilities for a                                 successful for immediate result document                                 to have this this values or this                                 properties and yeah let's now try to                                 compare two search result pages in terms                                 of diversity and also relevance what we                                 can see here that the search result on                                 the right is nearly                                                      more results oh well we could we could                                 assume that the recall of the right                                 search result page is                                                 but if we remember some some values that                                 we saw on previous slides we can see                                 that we can notice here different                                 authors on the left that we already                                 mentioned and so on our distributions                                 that the subjects on top of the left                                 section corresponds to the list of off                                 school subject so there and on the right                                 we have four out of six results from one                                 author or one publishing house and yes                                 oh well we can say that the left pages                                 is more                                 diversified than the right one and the                                 performance some conversions also                                 happened to be better with the left page                                 so after this                                 well example let's try to propose a goal                                 setting for diversifying search results                                 this is my proposal and I highlighted                                 that in in my opinion the goal is to                                 yeah to focus on users and taking                                 accounts they interests it's about                                 understanding them and it's also                                 important not just to aim to on their                                 own the first result page to provide the                                 users with their desired products it                                 would be perfect but at least to show                                 something that looks like what they                                 wanted to find and to purchase for                                 example and now well having this in mind                                 I'll look at some of the of these                                 opposition's                                 and try to yeah say couple of words                                 about them if they're if they're real                                 conflict here or not so well speaking                                 about this diversity versus relevance we                                 shouldn't mean that relevance is                                 important relevance is necessary but                                 relevance is also maybe an ambiguous                                 word because well we were notion we can                                 talk about relevance in terms of words                                 and text relevance warrant if we are                                 lucky to be able to deconstruct the                                 users tasks the relevance to this                                 precise task may be even more important                                 and there may be such situations when in                                 terms of text relevance less relevant                                 results can be more relevant or more                                 useful to solve this user test                                 another connected the previous one                                 opposition is between these two                                 strategies like do we as a search engine                                 have to only exploit to provide what we                                 asked to or can we instead or maybe not                                 instead understand the real task and to                                 make some recommendations maybe to                                 provide some results that can be also                                 useful                                 additionally useful some some some                                 additional results to what user                                 explicitly asked for or maybe can we                                 even suggest that there are some better                                 results some results that may be even                                 more useful more important for users of                                 course this second strategy looks more                                 dangerous but we believe that some                                 combination whereas also possible there                                 is a threat that adding personalization                                 can lead to less diversity in search                                 results maybe everyone among us at this                                 bad experience with personalization when                                 we once bought something or even just                                 click on some product and then being                                 chased turn earlier with these products                                 on different sides and so on but from                                 our perspective it's only a question of                                 implementation because as more                                 information as we can get about the user                                 we should get and we should use it to                                 make these results that we are offering                                 him more vailable for him well in our                                 terms in our example with the teachers                                 if we know for example that teacher is a                                 chemistry teacher and                                 she works in the primary school we can                                 illuminate or we can show more results                                 corresponding to these parameters but                                 still since we can't be                                                we know everything about the user there                                 is still space and should be left and                                 space for diversity and for some other                                 intense means or possible information                                 about the user well this is a really                                 hard question I have no direct answers                                 with how to measure diversity but we can                                 also consider a number of variants                                 number of ways first of all taking well                                 our goal setting I think it's useful                                 it's worth considering this first result                                 page is a one-hole product and try to                                 measure or to assess it and to judge it                                 like one message one answer to the user                                 and if we do this we can see that maybe                                 the diversity measurement is something                                 similar to a recall if we have if we                                 define already one dimension or maybe                                 some dimensions like the focus the                                 object or intense we can measure how                                 many or in what percentage the possible                                 intents have been covered by this first                                 result page yeah we only should should                                 admit that this is much more difficult                                 for with human judgments because well if                                 we have one intent it's much easier for                                 a mm Assessor for a writer to understand                                 its intention to assess the results but                                 it's really difficult or maybe even                                 impossible to get this impression of all                                 possible and intense                                 - somehow weighed them yeah I have five                                 minutes left and I'll I'll try I'll try                                 to be a little more faster yeah well the                                 last were almost last scene is about                                 user interface I'm not an expert at all                                 in this area but from the developers                                 side I would demand I would be happy if                                 user interface could help solve this                                 same task like if we already have a                                 really good relevant diversified search                                 result page it's worth our user                                 interface should help us or help users                                 to solve two main tasks first of all                                 quite quickly understand we are                                 potentially relevant results is of your                                 tasks and secondly for some similar                                 results to highlight the differences                                 because that's also important for making                                 a choice even where to click                                 now all just just a couple of examples                                 it's not to shame or to blame just to to                                 mark that the the problem we are trying                                 to solve is really existing and maybe                                 yeah quite relevant and timely so well                                 this is an example set set aside yeah                                 the relevance of the results for a                                 vacuum cleaner we can see - almost                                 similar or identical results and it's                                 yeah it's a problem to choose well                                 another example with iPhones we can                                 understand that the iPhone                                               is quite a popular and a good match for                                 many users but what's the difference in                                 in in this to precise variants and is it                                 worth like Dublin repeating the whole                                 information when it's only about the                                 difference                                 in the color maybe the last the last                                 example and it touches quite briefly                                 this conflict between its possible                                 contribution users interests and                                 retailers interest and undress we'll                                 talk more about it in detail hopefully                                 but what I want to say I as a user can                                 get the message that Amazon delivered                                 for me that Amazon really wants that I                                 bought this first item this first model                                 but I don't think and I hope you'll                                 agree with me that it's not a good idea                                 it's not a good idea                                 something that's important to you to                                 just repeat twice maybe there are some                                 other ways to bring deliver this                                 information and so well the last slide                                 what I want to say that from our                                 perspective search diversity is about                                 understanding is about better                                 communication it's about taking into                                 account minority interests and the                                 tricky thing here and an interesting                                 test is how not to damage the majorities                                 were not to significantly damage the                                 majorities user experience while taking                                 an account this minorities interests                                 thank you thank you very much                                 oh now like what                                 appreciate it so that was a great talk                                 and lift thanks for framing the problem                                 for us and I think you know the r                                       thing I want to point out as are the                                 three talks are from the e-commerce                                 domain but one thing I want to point out                                 is I think this is a problem regardless                                 of the specific domain it's a problem                                 and research getting different points of                                 view                                 I mentioned job search before the users                                 are increasingly less expressive                                 sometimes you know it's interesting we                                 are both solving for very expressive                                 queries with things involving natural                                 language using Bert and that kind of                                 thing but also users are extremely                                 unexpressive and sometimes I think                                 searches playing chess with with lazy                                 users it's like your intelligence is                                 competing with their laziness and I                                 think that's that's a fun aspect of this                                 diversity problem                                 you
