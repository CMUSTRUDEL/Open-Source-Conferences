A crisis of critical thinking - what Wikipedia can teach us about the future of information and technology’s role

Over time, we have all become avid consumers of information. Yet that information is increasingly fragmented and partisan, based on isolated effort instead of consensus. As we look to the future of information production, how can we build solutions that incentivize people to learn from each other, to understand the full complexity and nuance behind an issue instead of just their own perspective?

For the past two decades, Wikipedia has been helping humans and machines process the entire spectrum of information, from lengthy research and graduate level dissertations at one end to soundbites and trivia questions dictated to voice assistants at the other. We can provide a valuable model for how technology can help the next generation of knowledge-seekers decode, decipher and analyze information. This talk will focus on knowledge in the next evolution of the internet, and how we must enable not just more access to information, but also critical thinking at global scale.

you for                               showing up in support of this conference                               this is of course a very different                               experience from the very first Berlin                               was were noted                                                         regardless as to whether it is in person                               in one of my favorite cities in the                                world Berlin or done virtually as we are                                now I'm really excited to have the                                opportunity to kick things off with you                                all today before we dive into the next                                                                                                   acknowledge what's happening all around                                us even while we still show up here and                                are trying to learn and improve                                ourselves whether you are from the                                United States or not or personally                                affected by current events whether that                                is systemic racism in your home country                                the ongoing global pandemic the                                worldwide protests or simply are just                                deeply concerned about your ability to                                earn a living I hope you and your loved                                ones are safe and I hope we can all come                                to these really tough questions facing                                us as a world with an open mind and an                                open heart that is focused on making                                this conference our collective shared                                interest in technology and our broader                                world welcoming to all to that end I                                want to explore with you a question that                                is the inspiration for why I joined the                                Wikimedia Foundation as CTO                                          ago or so one that I think is very much                                relevant to this group and the topics                                that we all think about daily as someone                                with a background in search discovery                                and information seeking it's a question                                that has plagued me for years never more                                so than now given current events the                                rise of disinformation and gratification                                culture I want to explore this question                                how can we use tech to help people                                think more critically ideally Aztecas                                want to do with less work or at least                                less time put another way I want to ask                                the question how do we shrink the time                                it takes for each of us to get to that                                personal augment                                especially when we are considering                                deeply difficult topics that often                                require our multiple points of view and                                engagement over time now when I first                                submitted this talk way back in what                                seems like ancient times of I think                                January I originally thought I would                                explore this idea of critical thinking                                through the lens of a current event but                                I ultimately came to the conclusion to                                start with a lighter subject and show                                how I quickly it can lead to very deep                                and thoughtful reflection on a subject                                so I hope you will indulge me as I want                                to explore these questions of critical                                thinking by using a personal hobby of                                mine cycling both road and mountain bike                                for the record as well as of course our                                most well known project here at the                                wikimedia foundation wikipedia don't                                worry you don't need to read the slide                                in case you aren't familiar with us here                                at the foundation some quick fun facts                                about our little slice of the world we                                serve up over                                                         across some                                                             you're listening to this there is a                                wikipedia in your language in april                                alone we had                                                                                                    edits from around the globe and all of                                those are of course really cool stats                                perhaps but perhaps the most amazing                                thing about us from a tech standpoint is                                as a top                                                      incredibly efficient at doing this                                requiring just                                                         data centers and trust me now that I've                                seen                                behind the hood here that is incredibly                                efficient even though it feels like a                                big number but enough about us let's get                                back to our question on critical                                thinking                                to explore this question by going back                                to our cycling English Wikipedia page                                despite this being a topic that is                                relatively straightforward on the                                 surface after all it's a bicycle the                                 page itself covers everything from the                                 basic to the incredibly rich as one                                 might expect if you've ever perused                                 Wikipedia it covers different bikes like                                 the unicycle which I've always wanted to                                 learn to ride hey fun for the whole                                 family to recumbents which combined two                                 of my favorite things                                 biking and reclining it even has a                                 disambiguation link to my favorite team                                 sport                                 ice hockey no surprise when you dig into                                 this the community engagement is also                                 incredibly robust this page has been                                 edited nearly                                                         even anywhere near the top of our most                                 edited pages and it's been edited by                                 approximately                                                            edit happening just last week where it                                 gets a bit more interesting with just a                                 few clicks we can get into some of our                                 world's most pressing concerns topics                                 like air pollution or medical topics                                 like arthritis and cycling's effects on                                 it of course we                                 also touch on social and political                                 movements like critical mass and a                                 cyclist right to be on the road which of                                 course leads to much deeper reading on                                 strategies for political activism in                                 some ways we've now come full circle to                                 my opening reflection on where we are in                                 the world but in reality you're probably                                 wondering so what all I really did there                                 was demonstrate we as Hugh's Tim                                 berners-lee magical little invention we                                 called the Wow we clicked a few links we                                 browsed through some pages in essence                                 most of the critical thinking here was                                 done by the contributors up front as                                 they decided what links to include as                                 they decided what's relevant to a topic                                 and how to organize it well I wasn't                                 completely passive and that I chose what                                 to click based on my own personal                                 curiosity I'd have to do a lot of                                 additional work to inject my own                                 critical thinking into the process                                 perhaps by asking questions like what                                 else should I be thinking about related                                 to a mass what are the pros and cons of                                 direct action political activism what do                                 experts say about the physics of a bike                                 or about air pollution and then of                                 course I would have to go do the                                 requisite searching browsing refining                                 that is all too familiar to all of us as                                 users of Wikipedia and search engines                                 like Google but of course                                 bore through this story a lot more I                                 want to dig in on what's going on behind                                 the scenes a little bit with you both                                 from a contributors point of view and                                 from errs                                 how does Wikipedia do this work puts                                 together the millions of articles that                                 you and others read every single article                                 on our site is written by individual                                 volunteers working alone or together                                 each contribution involves summarizing                                 sources and evaluating different                                 perspectives in order to present the                                 most comprehensive and neutral                                 perspective on any topic whether that's                                 celebrity biographies or current affairs                                 or historical events by its very nature                                 collaborative editing encourages people                                 to consider other viewpoints Wikipedia                                 is better because of the fact that                                 editors disagree I'll touch on this more                                 later it forces us to question why we                                 think a topic should be represented in a                                 certain way of course our editors rely                                 on things like secondary sources they                                 cite open access journals they work with                                 libraries to add more references as they                                 improve and build articles from a                                 Wikipedia article you can click to                                 navigate the citations to great                                 journalism the collections of some of                                 the world's leading museums and archives                                 and of course you can access the latest                                 research in open access science because                                 Wikipedia is written by the world we are                                 also of course a reflection of its                                 biases we have a ton of articles about                                 Europe about military history and about                                 man that is reflective not only of the                                 interests of people who currently edit                                 Wikipedia but it's also the sort of                                 information historically considered                                 worthy and I emphasize historic                                 considered worthy of being Ingo pedia we                                 also still struggle with finding and                                 rooting out actors with malicious intent                                 or who are out for personal corporate or                                 political gain Wikipedia is by no means                                 perfect in fact the more we know what is                                 in Wikipedia the more we know what is                                 missing so that's a little bit about the                                 content on Wikipedia and the people                                 behind it what about the users all of                                 you in the audience the people who read                                 pedia who check it as their main source                                 of information on any given topic here's                                 the thing perhaps it's not all that                                 surprising but despite all of the work                                 our editors do to organize that content                                 users often have their own agenda on our                                 site just as I'm sure they do on your                                 site our users we routinely create their                                 own desire paths their own herd pass                                 their own navigation through our content                                 whether we want them to or not it's                                 almost as if our users know something                                 that we as curators don't know we see                                 this behavior throughout our experience                                 here for example one of the things we've                                 been working on on our research team                                 here at the foundation is mapping out                                 our topic spaces and then overlaying it                                 with our anonymized yes I'll repeat                                 anonymized user session behavior one of                                 the things you quickly see is there are                                 both very focused browsing sessions and                                 less focused browsing sessions                                 additionally many of our users also go                                 back out to our search or to sites like                                 Google or                                 go and come back in as well to re-engage                                 with topics along different vectors                                 different lines of thinking interesting                                 enough this type of behavior also                                 depends on the topics that users are                                 searching for for instance our team has                                 also found that users reading stem                                 articles science technology engineering                                 and math are often very much gonna get                                 in get your information and get out mode                                 where as users reading us about culture                                 based topics spread out more to cover a                                 variety of different topics guess what                                 and I'm not bursting your bubble here                                 but I think this user behavior is also                                 spilling over at the societal level we                                 see this in the rise of privacy first                                 search engines like go for chat apps                                 like telegram we see it in new laws like                                 GD P R or even the greater awareness of                                 things like end-to-end encryption in the                                 context of applications like zoom and                                 slack in our messaging platforms and of                                 course we see these same questions in                                 the neverending debate around Facebook's                                 use of data it all begs the question in                                 my mind what is our responsibility here                                 as technologists I'd like to share with                                 you for a moment how my thinking has                                 evolved on this subject and then how it                                 leads to the crux of this idea around                                 critical thinking like many of you I                                 suspect I got into tech because it was a                                 ton of fun to work and solve really hard                                 problems on this infinite landscape that                                 is a computer and the Internet                                 and of course I'd be lying if I didn't                                 say the pay is pretty good too once I                                 discover                                 search and open-source and distributed                                 systems it only further amplified that                                 joy I got from problem-solving as my                                 career grew alongside the growth of the                                 Internet                                 throwing natural language processing and                                 machine learning and I felt like it was                                 in engineering heaven perhaps you all                                 can relate until the doubt started it                                 first creeped in at the dawn of the big                                 data era and the explosion of ad tech                                 intra ad tracking tech and it grew                                 louder the more I engaged with it don't                                 get me wrong I fully participated in                                 this movement I've stood on stages like                                 this one in fact I've done it when                                 buzzwords mean about the opportunity is                                 through of applications and the handing                                 of users and their desires through datum                                 I mean natural language processing and                                 of course the big buzzword of all                                 artificial intelligence but I could                                 never quite shake the doubt that there                                 has to be more to it is waged that doubt                                 by telling myself I wouldn't work in                                 industries that don't align with my                                 values but the doubt persisted there has                                 to be something more the thing is I                                 still believe in the incredible                                 opportunity we have in front of us to                                 use computers and data to progress                                 ourselves and I still believe private                                 companies have the right to collect data                                 as long as their terms of use are clear                                 well understood and respect our privacy                                 but had to ask myself some pretty hard                                 questions many of them centered around                                 is there a way to bring these seemingly                                 competing things together and I think                                 there is I think we                                 opportunity you might even say a                                 critical opportunity in front of us we                                 have chance to raise the discourse and                                 understanding online while still selling                                 our wares in our eyeballs doing our                                 searches all of the things that we as                                 technologists like to do I believe we                                 have a chance to enable more critical                                 thinking online we are at a point in our                                 time as technologists scratch that as                                 humans help people make better use of                                 our information to understand the                                 nuances of information to make more                                 informed decisions and more informed                                 opinions not just whatever comes to mind                                 in the moment I believe our users are                                 already telling us that they want this                                 their behavior shows it and yet most                                 sites do little to encourage it well I                                 think it can often be attributed simply                                 to lack of awareness I do also think                                 it's often due to our desire to funnel                                 people in to specific actions this leads                                 me to believe we need a new paradigm for                                 content creation curation and readership                                 we need one that aligns with matching                                 all of the information needs of users                                 and for those of you and your out in the                                 audience especially you have studied                                 search I think you really know what I'm                                 talking here about when you really think                                 about all of the information needs we                                 have not just those that are very                                 tactical in the moment not just those                                 that are designed for QA systems like                                 Alexa our search systems like Google we                                 have to find ways to get beyond that                                 quick snackable content we need to                                 recognize that are you spending a lot                                 more time than we give them credit for                                 looking for information trying to dice                                 to understand we have to get past the                                 session based on analytics that drive so                                 much of our behavior and look beyond we                                 have to recognize that our users want to                                 build a deeper understanding and they                                 want to do it faster we reflect back                                 you'll also come to the conclusion that                                 we as humans over a thousands of years                                 have built many constructs for critical                                 thinking maybe not always in the most                                 inclusive way but a help but feel like                                 we're here are letting those gains slip                                 away online as we push people to find                                 their tribe or we funnel them to meet                                 our analytics goals or our sales goals                                 we recognize that we as builders of                                 these large tech platforms have                                 forgotten about the social constructs                                 that encourage critical thinking the                                 Wikipedia movement has built many of                                 these constructs into the movement                                 stum through software but most through                                 people policies assisi's per se with                                 ideas like trying to achieve a neutral                                 point of view or fact-based reasoning or                                 consensus building or verifiability                                 or perhaps our most cherished that                                 everyone has the right to knowledge                                 here's the really cool thing about these                                 social constructs the community here at                                 Wikipedia has built and by the way keep                                 in mind and honor to this movement I'm                                 still learning there's so much to learn                                 and knowing knows how this                                             meant by Del's and Larry Sanger it works                                 but there are a few engine bits I want                                 to have you take away first there was a                                 recent study publisher Business Review                                 that showed that when people with skins                                 contribute to Wikipedia their                                 contributions and perhaps I like to                                 think hopefully I like to think their                                 views get more neutral over time Pete                                 that they get more neutral over time a                                 second study attempted to quantify just                                 how much diverse there's coming to the                                 conclusion that the site's most dead                                 much of verdicts tend to also be of much                                 higher quality                                 when was the last time you heard either                                 of those kinds of said about behaviors                                 online in                                                                impossible dream                                 and yet it's happening in fact I think                                 it's just the opposite of an Impala                                 dream I think we as a group actually                                 have many of the tools and skills in                                 place to enable this deeper and richer                                 engagement with our content and each                                 other and I believe we can do right by                                 all the social constructs developed over                                 all the years that encourage critical                                 thinking while putting a modern spin on                                 them that also makes room for so many of                                 the voices that have been traditionally                                 shut out                                 think about it we have tools like search                                 and recommendation engines for servicing                                 content to users what would it look like                                 if we tweaked our scoring algorithms for                                 diversity of results when we detected                                 exploratory invent intense on                                 controversial topics we also have                                 natural language processing models for                                 identifying related topics as well as                                 topic bringing different perspectives                                 what if we fed those into our feeds                                 piece by piece instead of the usual                                 fodder that reinforces our belief                                 systems we also have crawlers that can                                 harvest the entire web and build                                 authoritative algorithms like PageRank                                 and of course we have analytics                                 capabilities oh do we have analytics                                 capabilities for identifying all these                                 user journeys and testing out these                                 hypotheses yet there are still many open                                 questions especially on the social                                 construct side but here's where I think                                 some of the Wikipedia values can                                 actually help us on the technology side                                 for start we might ask ourselves how                                 might we use this no Valatie on our                                 platforms first off I do want to note                                 here that for us a neutral point of view                                 doesn't mean our community of volunteers                                 don't try to understand and represent                                 multiple sides of the story nor do I                                 want to represent that even some of                                 those feel very strongly about of                                 particular one of those sides but it                                 does mean they have a commitment to try                                 to present those sides in a neutral                                 unbiased way how might we use this on                                 other platforms I might we use things                                 like text classification to recognize                                 content that would benefit from other                                 viewpoints how might we use it to help                                 people better flesh out their side of an                                 argument                                 how am I                                 we use it to help people see the other                                 aspects of a problem perhaps most                                 importantly how do we do this without                                 taking away our users creativity and                                 freedom of expression neutrality feeds                                 on consensus one of the interesting                                 aspects of Wikipedia one that I didn't                                 quite get at first is that everyone sees                                 the same article on any given topic                                 there's some nuance there there's no                                 customized content for someone who's a                                 fan of bikes from track versus giant for                                 example because there is only one                                 article our editors have an incentive to                                 come to consensus they must edit this                                 one article on a topic therefore they                                 must find a way to reconcile their                                 different perspectives emphasize a                                 neutral point of view and to decide what                                 information to include in the article                                 for many of you coming here from open                                 source this perhaps is nothing new at a                                 social level probably isn't something                                 you've thought about building into your                                 tack other than perhaps at the really                                 low level of things like consensus                                 algorithms like Paxos in our distributed                                 systems where we have to build consensus                                 in order to make sure the machines are                                 up let me ask the question what might it                                 look like for you to build in your                                 system using tools like collaborative                                 filtering or other recommendation                                 engines to devise consensus on your                                 platform maybe it's not obvious at first                                 depending on where what your platform                                 does but I bet there are ways that you                                 can do it                                 right now a lot of work goes into                                 verifying content on sites not just what                                 I'm sure yours or the fact-checking                                 politicians or figure out whether                                 something is this some shin or                                 disinformation in fact active                                 disinformation campaigns are making it                                 even different                                 for us to know is true we as                                 technologists we need to find a way to                                 build verifiability into our user                                 generated content systems we need a ways                                 to customs can mark content as                                 unverified and on top of that we need a                                 way that our users accept and try to do                                 something about and not just try to                                 legislate it away I wish I answer for                                 this one but I asked the question how                                 might we use all of our content                                 harvesting systems like our fancy                                 crawlers and our deepening model even                                 sites like Wikipedia and we to better                                 know what is credible                                 what is verifiable and what is trust                                 work now all of these ice in my mind                                 really point to a need for a better set                                 of open transparent verifiable                                 moderation tools it's interesting when I                                 talk to my peers at other user-generated                                 content sites they to express this same                                 need for better moderation tools how do                                 we help our users better care for our                                 sites they want tools that can be used                                 across platforms so that we'd all don't                                 have to reinvent the wheel we want tools                                 that build in like spam control some of                                 the most features we've taught today                                 tools that allow communities to easily

              their heart most of all we need tools                                 that enable critical thinking encourage                                 us to be better forms of ourselves one                                 such way we are doing this here at the                                 foundation and in the community is                                 through the creation of a system we                                 called Jade I'll link it up at the end                                 for you all that is designed to capture                                 the label data that we all know is so                                 important Xin learning algorithms but                                 we're doing it at a very Wikipedia way                                 not only does it allow us to capture the                                 usual annotations that many of you in                                 the audience are familiar with when                                 building training and test sets for our                                 machine learning algorithms but it also                                 allows our community to register                                 disagreements to decide on a best label                                 and to make improvements over time just                                 do when improving articles through pages                                 revisions and reverts our hope is that                                 Jade will play a critical role in                                 helping our community track the trends                                 and biases in the machine learning                                 models we host for them by making sure                                 that Wikipedians have the final say over                                 the data we use to train and evaluate                                 models in many ways we are giving them a                                 powerful tool to govern the algorithm                                 manage on their behalf why does this                                 ability to enable critical thinking                                 matter perhaps it feels                                 just too hard but beyond I think beyond                                 the obvious societal gains more informed                                 decision makers and a more informed                                 electorate electorate practically                                 speaking I think it leads to deeper                                 engagement and loyalty as users are able                                 to make more informed decisions whether                                 they are those are in what they buy                                 spend their time or who they vote for we                                 had a lot of work ahead of us and it                                 won't be easy but I trust we can go                                 further and faster                                 the sooner we burst our bubbles and get                                 our users out of their bubbles due to                                 leave you with a few resources on how we                                 might engage on this and then of course                                 I'm happy to answer a few questions of                                 course make sure we have these links                                 available beyond that I want to thank                                 you for your time and I hope you enjoy                                 the rest of your comp rest of the                                 conference a grant I'm Josh I'm here in                                 Berlin with buzzwords crew and I have a                                 few questions and comments on the slack                                 channel so the first one comes from                                 Matteo and he asks is no bias equal to                                 neutrality so he's further asks also to                                 see some changes in society is in some                                 degree of polarity necessary that's a                                 great question and a very deep enriched                                 topic I don't the Wikipedia community                                 tries to get rid of bias completely in                                 or or think through that there are                                 multiple points of view I think in fact                                 if you just bring back up our resources                                 here and we share that I think if you                                 read like so under the Jade a neutral                                 point of view bullets towards the ends                                 of this it's interesting they've                                 actually codified quite a bit what                                 neutral point of view mean                                 and it it does not mean that we try to                                 get everything to just be this one                                 perfect no biased view what they try to                                 then do instead is represent all of the                                 different views or at least many of them                                 and so to be able to compare and                                 contrast it's interesting they've also                                 developed kind of subtlety and nuance                                 that is designed to give way to ones                                 that are more commonly accepted so as to                                 not you know necessarily be by a school                                 the Fringe ideas or what some people                                 interview or not am by no means an                                 expert here but I I do think you know to                                 the to the the first of the question                                 there isn't need to have some of that                                 tension the real question then and the                                 critical thinking approach is how do we                                 then resolve those tensions how do we                                 get past those how do we build up                                 constructs that allow us to have more                                 constructive debates as opposed to just                                 everybody going into their camp like now                                 so it's a great question on a related                                 subject and so this question for me how                                 do you deal with not only biases and                                 communities but communities that really                                 gang up on each other in a way and we                                 see this right now and a lot of the                                 political debates and is there a way you                                 know when we think about bias and                                 machine learning biases effectively the                                 the information that is not knowable by                                 the machine so how do we deal with this                                 being able to detect this how do we                                 trust certain communities communities of                                 editors how are you thinking about these                                 types of topics at Wikipedia yeah is a                                 hard problem I think you know there's a                                 lot of work in the communities around                                 governance it certainly does                                 individuals biases and of course as I                                 mentioned earlier on one of the earlier                                 slides it stood up yeah very real ways                                 there's been another number of studies                                 around things like the gender gap on                                 Wikipedia and representation for                                 traditionally been underrepresented it                                 because history hasn't told their                                 stories there's therefore                                 a sizable references but there's a lot                                 of working forward those stories and                                 make them sizable and and bowling                                 encyclopedia way gone for instance the                                 main way most articles that get                                 discussed you could go to any Wikipedia                                 page you'll see a discussion tab or                                 what's called page internally some of                                 those talk pages in fact can be quite                                 enlightening they can also be quite                                 toxic and so I think you know we have to                                 recognize as all points that we have to                                 make space to listen for them and then                                 come to our own opinions and and own                                 hopefully informed opinions I do think                                 you know perhaps Wikipedia is has some                                 things going for it like I mentioned                                 here and that at the end of the day                                 there's one page right it's not somebody                                 spins off and says here other that has                                 my right like the community will cease                                 that building it consists in the                                 volunteer community and have been                                 thoroughly debated for a year or so I                                 think you know we have to find ways to                                 to provide that governance as we go                                 forward and I suspect there's ways                                 machine learning can help I don't fully                                 know if they can we have enough evidence                                 that we recognize when it's happening it                                 reminds me I think SuperFlow I believe                                 published a blog post on one of the                                 things they did on stood back over but                                 the unfriendly PBOT I think you can just                                 search for that Stack Overflow and                                 unfriendly bought what they did was they                                 trained a machine learning by to                                 recognize in users comments weren't                                 particularly helpful for solving a                                 problem found pretty quickly that when                                 the people making the comments were told                                 by the hey you probably could improve                                 this you could probably make this more                                 opening and welcome that the users                                 actually did so I think                                 could start with some of these more                                 simple things and build and learn from                                 those so maybe a good related question                                 is Peter s is one of Wikimedia as goal                                 is to become the barometer of opinion                                 versus balance yeah I don't think we're                                 well I I of course can't speak for the                                 community there are a lot of people with                                 a lot of opinions so are we meant to be                                 the barometer of a pin oh I think our                                 goal is to make sure that we have people                                 have the right to free and open access                                 to knowledge right and so I think our                                 our goal is to make sure that it is                                 properly represented and served gets                                 properly I'm not even sure if that's the                                 right word but that knowledge has a                                 place to live and is free and open to                                 anyone in the world so there's a not so                                 much of a question more of a comment                                 from Sarah she says I agree with grant                                 that it should be a goal to enable                                 critical thinking at the same time there                                 seems to be this almost unsolvable                                 problem that we have masses of                                 information available which is                                 constantly coming in making it very hard                                 to stay on top of an in-depth                                 understanding of facts this is why we                                 came up with text summarization for                                 example if these methods though take                                 away depth in favor of making the masses                                 readable critical thinking could suffer                                 what are your thoughts on that yeah for                                 sure Sarah I think that's spot-on and I                                 mean I think that's why you know I                                 talked about like if you study                                 information theory information retrieval                                 etc you know there's often this bias                                 towards the short the ten blue links the                                 question-answering systems but if you                                 actually you know and I've had this                                 experience in Prior jobs you know as you                                 actually dig into people's search                                 behavior for instance you see them                                 routinely coming back to a site around                                 different you know viewpoints on a topic                                 you even you know you see this at the                                 e-commerce layer people search one day                                 for a specific thing they forget about                                 it they come back a week later again may                                 different things they're doing that                                 in gathering they're looking for                                 alternatives they're looking for cheaper                                 prices whatever it is right and I think                                 you know it's recognizing that people                                 have this need over time you know one of                                 the fields in search that does this and                                 sees this firsthand is ediscovery if                                 you've ever spent any time in the                                 ediscovery space you know that lawyers                                 and legal scholars etc are often looking                                 to gather all of the things that are on                                 topic and they have to wade through                                 thousands these days millions of pieces                                 of content to find you know the smoking                                 gun the defense whatever it is that                                 helps serve their case and so they have                                 to think across time same goes for                                 things like PhD students etc and I saw                                 part of my challenge here for all of us                                 is like how do we think about better                                 ways to capture and learn from our users                                 over time beyond just the very tactical                                                                                                       session and the query rewriting that                                 many of us are so focused on right those                                 are of course valid we still need those                                 very quick snackable to settle a bet or                                 I'll find out what the price of a widget                                 is we also have these broader needs                                 across time and I think we are doing a                                 disservice if we don't spend at least                                 some time on those types of problems so                                 Peter is hosting I believe a talk later                                 this week on Thursday about diversifying                                 search results and this was brought up                                 in this talk so if anyone's interested                                 feel free to check out that talk as well                                 there was another question about search                                 relevancy at Wikipedia so effectively                                 how is it handled so especially given                                 that users are usually not logged in to                                 Wikipedia itself and there's no tracking                                 no personal data involved how at a high                                 level if you can in a nutshell how does                                 relevance work media                                 no I share on its flight it is funny for                                 being somebody who's coming from the                                 search space to the interesting thing                                 for me was I think I've been here just                                 now and search is probably the area I've                                 I've spent my my take was that hey it's                                 pretty well there certainly are some                                 areas of improvement that we are working                                 on surround image search and things like                                 that but for the most part it's been                                 working especially for the more popular                                 sites so we sought a time on some of the                                 underserved search communities our                                 search team has blogged fairly                                 extensively about search in fact one of                                 our computational linguists just put up                                 a post about processing income here as a                                 language for search so all that to say                                 digging in a little bit the things I do                                 know about and certainly half provides                                 some links we have a fairly large                                 elasticsearch cluster across multiple                                 nodes we are using learning to rank                                 plugins quite extensively a number of                                 the sites we use anonymous user behavior                                 queries logging all that kind of stuff                                 to get at the the best relevance for our                                 topics we don't have a query intent in                                 place yet we let's see what else we do                                 some light session analysis again on on                                 an anonymized behavior we do have a be                                 testing capabilities in our search                                 engine so if you've ever heard me talk                                 about things like learning to rank or a                                 be testing we do have many of those                                 things in place let's see what else like                                 I said over at the blog post yeah we can                                 do as I said earlier too we we do have                                 in support search across some                                     languages so and we have contributed a                                 number I believe of improvements back to                                 leucine                                 or they are at least available our                                 analysis are available in our open                                 source repositories so yeah I wish I                                 could say more there there's a lot to                                 dig
