	                              Netta separated from the apps that did                               she use and and we want to make this a                               little bit more personal so we consider                               your personal data as a digital                               expression of your yourself and the apps                               and services that you use those are a                               digital expression of the brand or the                               company behind these these apps and that                               brings us to our vision or mission                                statement and that is that we want to                                enable people to take back their online                                autonomy by creating balanced                                relationships I underlined autonomy that                                basically means that we want to give                                people back control of their data and                                balance is that if you connect with the                                brand there are two entities that                                connect and they all should they brought                                you to the FSA in in this relationship                                if we consider a relation and not just a                                connection there are several things we                                can consider first of all is when you                                enter a relationship the other entity                                becomes part of your own identity and                                the second thing is that a relationship                                goes through different phases you get to                                know each other or the brand you go the                                relation gets deeper and and sometimes                                it will end as well                                and the last thing about relations is                                that each relationship is unique that's                                because of two things one is that you                                and I can both look at the same brand or                                the same person but see something                                different but also it's when the context                                change the way we interact in a                                relationship will also change                                so with Luke we try to use these                                different aspects of a relation and try                                to translate that into a product that                                you that a user can use in e-commerce                                and and I would like to show you some                                examples that we made and hopefully it                                gives you an idea of like what we wanted                                to do so the first concept is the defeat                                basically the feed is that you can                                connect a brand to your own personal                                data account so at this point you don't                                have a relationship yet you don't have                                bought anything else but you can add the                                brand to your personal identity if you                                do this the brand doesn't know anything                                about you yet you don't share data with                                brand yes and another thing is that if                                you shop with different brands you can                                all collect them in in your personal                                account you can have an overview of all                                the brand's you connected with the                                purchases you made and and also you can                                go into the details of each brand and                                see how you are connected with them you                                can adjust these connections or you can                                even remove the brand altogether and                                last thing I want to show you is the                                Express Checkout so with your data in                                your own account you instead of filling                                out a form you can just have all your                                settings ready                                wherever you go and just do the purchase                                so this is almost done you can make some                                quick attachment adjustments and just                                quickly go to payment and so these are                                just a few                                I think basic things based on the                                customer journey in e-commerce as it is                                today but we see many new opportunities                                that we can do if we will approach the                                way we if we approach it in this way so                                hope it's the best clear thank you for                                your attention and interest any                                questions please let me know                                you
