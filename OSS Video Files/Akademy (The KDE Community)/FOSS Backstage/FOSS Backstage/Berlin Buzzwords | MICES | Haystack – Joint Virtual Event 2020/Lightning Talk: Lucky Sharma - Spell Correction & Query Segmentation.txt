	                              I think we move on further we have next                               talk from again from lucky he would be                               talking about the sim-based                               spell correctly welcome back lucky one                               so now so this one I'm going to talk                               about the spell the spell correction and                               the quiz segmentation part which is like                               the one of the basic things which we                               need to encounter and e-commerce search                                searches so the idea which we so we                                created a simple based customized Java                                elimination of that the Simpsons                                basically written personally by will                                draw a MC shop so we have adopted that                                and right it's Java port but add on to                                that we added some custom customizations                                to that also                                so basically what simple comprises of is                                basically comprises of the single word                                spelling correction the compound the                                will manatee with spelling Corrections                                like the word breaking and the word                                joining part for an example nut free                                chocolates without space and with space                                and we added the quality distance to                                that so if someone is like typing slice                                and in the index we have slices and                                olives so if I look at the Edit distance                                both have their distance one in the                                beginning but if I look at the keyboard                                I see that compared to slack slice                                compared to olives the s in the word                                basically a poles apart they're on the                                opposite side of the keyboard but if I                                see at the VNC of slides and slices that                                basically absent so this gives a major                                weight eight that this is more closer to                                the original word so in that case the                                qwerty distance will help us the other                                part is we have integrated this simple                                two solar or we have cried one component                                on that simple so that can be easily                                used so which leverages us to use search                                engine data as a dictionary so what                                happens with any spell caption is like                                you need to provide a text when you do                                that so if I am writing a dictionary and                                I'm having a new planet                                Dan at all                                and if someone misspelled it it will not                                get autocorrected ante unless we have                                that word in your dictionary and our                                spell character knows about it so with                                the leverage of the integration we get a                                part where we can read the index data                                and create that dictionary on either on                                on every commit operation or any reload                                operation so that's what we did and                                there is one more idea on base of spell                                is like a context-based spelling                                correction so context is Ella                                Christensen like if I have if I type the                                MA                                LK right which could be milk or want                                so basically which one would be                                appropriate so if a person is like                                browsing the beverages and if I if he                                types no mal k then it surely means mud                                but if it's like browsing the groceries                                and it I am al k then it means milk so                                what we are currently doing is that we                                are creating kinetic space we are Bank                                approach and count encounter this                                problem of kinetics misspelling                                Corrections using the simple so as I                                mentioned right there examples like not                                free without space and strong milk and                                let's say we don't even even find to see                                the skimmed minute result because it                                basically correcting of one word ants                                miss Kelly splitting over so also but                                semi spell is basically a symmetry                                delete spelling correction algorithm                                which basically reduces the complexity                                of added Canada technician it basically                                much faster and language independent so                                basically we have also created along                                with QWERTY we have created the codes                                the keyboard for German and it is much                                faster                                because it basically creates the delete                                dictionary so that it all Italy added                                distance as a time while reading the                                dictionary itself so here are some                                matrices so compared to knowledge                                bigotry Lin spell see misspell performs                                much better on a five hundred thousand                                word dictionary when such time for                                     words so this is what the quotation                                 symmetric matrix we use so we see that                                 we                                 is connecting to both C F G and B so we                                 made them on the business of like                                 directly connectivity and the diagonal                                 connectivity so direct connectivity has                                 a very short windage and background                                 connectivity is slightly higher with                                 this compared direct connectivity and we                                 use the these weights in the                                 dominologist GN calculation where we                                 basically multiplies it with the replace                                 distance so double all that this chain                                 is nothing but the added basically are                                 what you should I say it's a basically a                                 it's a around two levenshtein distance                                 which also calculates it transpositions                                 other words of the captives in this one                                 we basically added add on to it like we                                 added that you can also add weights with                                 specific operations like you can add                                 weights to insert operation delete                                 operation so by default it's on one but                                 if you want to say that it could be                                 delete provable so you can reduce the                                 delete weight and you can basically play                                 with these weights to find out what                                 could be the possible best approach for                                 you for your echo system                                 so this is our accuracy summary so when                                 we index like three thousand                                             and did eight thousand sixty searches                                 with leucine was giving a lot of false                                 negatives which was                                                  tried with vanilla same spill it gives                                                                                                          with QWERTY P is vanilla semi spelled to                                 us                                                    similarly the true positives also                                 increased compared to losing and that's                                 why we plan it to Sola to move it to                                 Sola so that we can leverage the more                                 accuracy comes what we're getting from                                 sipping so that's all this is the github                                 link for the customized a misspelled I'm                                 open source that it's available in maven                                 central so you can let me use it few                                 companies are already trying to use it                                 and he is Melanie and thank you everyone                                 that's all I have any questions great                                 super talk I think I was looking forward                                 to for to this one please graph it                                 tonight yes we have questions there are                                 few questions that I actually can add                                 but I think you answered all of them I                                 was wanting to see if we compared it                                 existing solar spellchecker I think you                                 covered that plus the plan to                                 incorporate that in solar as well I                                 think you've covered that to me so both                                 of my questions are answered but we have                                 one question from Ian's and he asks you                                 that is there a way to combine Keeper                                 and D for distance measures combine                                 keyboard I didn't get that so like                                 combining even and D for distance                                 measures thousand if I I'm getting the                                 question correct it's like you are                                 trying to put a default distance                                 measures along with the what the                                 distance is it yeah I think yes yes so                                 another question coming in from Senate                                 he says that you mentioned compounds he                                 and it handle compounds of three more                                 words or compounds that have in fixes                                 yeah definitely so that's what yeah it                                 can handle that so suppose I am writing                                 like I am a force going to market                                 without special air in the jungle and                                 without with spaces like in it you know                                 accommodate for Foreman it will be it                                 basically corrects them it did right                                 I cannot wait to try it actually and                                 I'll let you know and I'm really excited                                 that it's getting incorporated into                                 solar so that was a great shock and high                                 enough a food for thought                                 for tonight at least so thank you so                                 much for great lucky I think we would                                 see you around on these social                                 you
