2020 has heightened our attention for multiple difficult problems without clear solutions including the COVID-19 pandemic, a global economic downturns, and police violence.  These problems fit the pattern of "Wicked Problems" as originally described by Rittel and Weber in 1973.  Wicked Problems, are systemic problems without a clear formulation, and without clear solutions.  Despite the difficulties in understanding and solving these problems, some organizations are better equipped than others for making progress on them.  Surprisingly, many of these organizations share a common hallmark: the ability to promote women into positions of leadership.

I will explain what Wicked Problems are, look at examples where we are succeeding at mitigating these problems, and examine commonalities that arise across successful approaches.  Then I will present two examples in which Women in Open Source, Open Data, and Open Standards are helping to make the world a better place both in the context of COVID-19, and in the context of the broader problems humanity faces.

	                              hi everybody I am going to talk today to                               you about how women and opensource lead                               in times of coronavirus first I would                               like to introduce myself my name is                               Merle Krantz I'm a former board member                               of the Apache Software Foundation                               I was also conference chair in last year                               at Apache Con in Berlin I am currently                               the treasurer at Apache and I'm also an                                individual contributor for a couple of                                different humanitarian that's what the H                                in H ba stands for humanitarian free and                                open-source software projects for                                example effective in Iraq and I also did                                a hackathon for openmrs a couple years                                ago so first let's ask what makes corona                                virus so challenging why is this such a                                difficult problem to solve well if we                                look at it from multiple sides we can                                see for example a corona virus has a                                huge economic impact even without the                                lockdown                                the loss of life the loss of time has                                just a significant amount of cost to                                humanity finding reliable and accurate                                information about corona virus and about                                its effects can be difficult the                                information flow in a relationship                                building that we perform in the world                                today has been interrupted by social                                distancing and by the changing work                                situations so those are problems that we                                have to solve those out there have been                                massive changes in government assistance                                as governments have stepped up to                                strengthen their social network there                                have been increases in spending they've                                been changes and programs that have been                                that need to be communicated and brought                                to the people that are meant to help                                secure data exchange for legislators has                                been a problem voting work for                                legislators who aren't there and you                                would traditionally insisted that their                                members be there homeschooling for                                parents who still have to work while                                they're solving all of these other                                problems there have been sudden massive                                changes to supply chain chains differing                                needs factories no longer able to                                produce factories needing to produce                                different things transportation being                                interrupted and other                                CAIR without it was social distancing                                has also been a problem so what to all                                of these problems have in common many of                                these problems even all of these                                problems are wicked problems and wicked                                problems is a sort of problem a kind of                                problem that has been recognized since                                the early                                                             classic paradigm or rather it is a                                description of a problem for which the                                classic paradigm of science and                                engineering fails the paradigm that has                                under Lane modern professionalism just                                doesn't work in these kinds of problems                                because their system problems they're                                cyclical those societal problems and                                they're inherently different from the                                problems that engineers do is so what is                                a wicked problem well it's not just a                                hard problem it's a problem that moves                                away from you when you try to solve it                                or even moves away from you when you try                                to understand it so a wicked problem is                                a problem for which knowledge is                                incomplete or even contradictory for                                which there's a huge number of people                                and opinions involved also contradictory                                it's a problem was a large economic                                burden at least within its context and                                it's very interconnected                                there are not only cyclical dependencies                                there's multiple cyclical dependencies                                so it's a system problem it's a system                                problem in which the parts have no clear                                separation from each other there's no                                definitive formulation of a wicked                                problem so for the coronavirus are we                                balancing the corona virus transmission                                against economic damage or what counts                                as economic damage with the problems                                have no stopping rule that is you don't                                know when you're finished solving them                                how much coronavirus transmission is                                acceptable do we really want to set that                                at zero how much disease transmission in                                general is acceptable solutions to                                 wicked problems are not true or false                                 they're good or bad there are moral                                 problems and when a problem is a more                                 problems and conflicts that stem from                                 competing value systems come into it                                 questions like questions of                                 self-determination versus the care for                                 the societal good arise there's no                                 immediate or ultimate test for the                                 solution of away the problem precisely                                 because there's differing value systems                                 from which you could approach it every                                 solution to wicked problem is a one-shot                                 operation you do it but once you've done                                 it you can't do another experiment and                                 say the situation is the same because                                 it's not every solution changes that                                 there's no AV testing there's no                                 enumerable set of possibilities as to                                 how to solve it                                 but every wicked problem is unique so                                 for example coronavirus transmission in                                 Japan is different than current average                                 transmission in Italy because family                                 living situations are different                                 willingness to wear masks is different                                 population density is different so the                                 solutions are going to be different                                 every wicked problem can be considered                                 to be a symptom of another problem so                                 you might consider coronavirus a symptom                                 of people not being willing to wear                                 masks but if people wear masks then they                                 might spend more time in groups which                                 increases for an A virus transmission                                 um it's sometimes it doesn't work the                                 way you expect it to so the existence of                                 discrepancy a thing that you want to                                 change can be explained in multiple ways                                 within the context what we committed                                 here I'm going to take a step out of the                                 corona virus for a moment and talk about                                 the riots in the u.s. are riots caused                                 by police violence or do riots happen                                 because protesters get violent or do                                 riots happen because riders are angry                                 about injustice well depending on which                                 explanation you choose that will change                                 what approach you take to solving the                                 problem                                 so the planner doesn't have a right to                                 be wrong but the planner is almost                                 guaranteed to be wrong to move back to                                 coronavirus every mistake costs lives                                 and even good decisions are going to end                                 up costing lives and there's no way to                                 go back and say that you did the right                                 thing because you can't go back and try                                 a different thing in compare                                 so how do we as computer scientists and                                 programmers typically solve problems                                 well the first thing we do is we try to                                 create a clear definition we break                                 problems into their component pieces or                                 we perform root-cause analysis we find                                 the problem and we look for a problem                                 that caused that problem and we look for                                 another problem that caused it the                                 second problem well these are good                                 approaches for for partial problems but                                 they're not sufficient for wicked                                 problems so we just determined that a                                 clear definition of the problem might                                 not help us actually understand the                                 problem because there might be multiple                                 contradictory equally valid clear                                 definitions breaking the problem into                                 its component pieces might not actually                                 be possible and following root causes                                 might bring you right back to the                                 beginning because problems caused                                 themselves with wicked problems so                                 wicked problems can't be solved with                                 these steps what we need is a nonlinear                                 approach and fortunately we already have                                 people practitioners in our community                                 who do do nonlinear approaches those are                                 our designers Design Thinking is a                                 nonlinear process designers have to gain                                 a deep knowledge of their community                                 rather than a superficial knowledge of                                 the problems designers need to develop                                 meaningful relationships with the                                 stakeholders or even be the stakeholders                                 themselves designers must remain

other examples of                                 wicked problems that we're not going to                                 dive too deep into but that might help                                 you understand what do we the problem is                                 global hunger is an example of a wicked                                 problem diversity in the STEM fields is                                 an example of a wicked problem police                                 brutality is an example of a wicked                                 problem in global warming is an example                                 idiot problem and if you're interested                                 in looking at ways                                 approaches sort of generalize approaches                                 to to solving these wicked problems you                                 might be interested in reading a book                                 called switch how to change when change                                 is hard by chippies this is a side note                                 so this all sounds very depressing and                                 very negative one of the things that is                                 suggested in the book that I just                                 mentioned switch is that rather than                                 look at the bad parts we look at what's                                 working we look at we look for bright                                 spots areas in which we seem to be doing                                 better than in other areas so let's do                                 that let's look at where we're                                 succeeding against ferony fires well                                 berlin buzzwords it seemed appropriate                                 to bring up that Germany is doing very                                 well now it's not perfect we don't have                                 zero cases and they don't have zero                                 deaths but given the degree to which                                 Germany is networked with the world this                                 is actually a pretty good result                                 with a population of                                                    has had                                                                 deaths the death rate for infected                                 people has been very very low and                                 Germany has managed to start stopping                                 transmission within within its borders                                 Finland has done extremely well they                                 managed to keep the number of deaths                                 down to                                                            Finland and Germany are fundamentally                                 different countries Finland has a much                                 lower population density than Germany                                 so the solutions that that apply in Finn                                 that might not apply in Germany and the                                 other way around as well New Zealand has                                 had only                                                         recently announced that they've got the                                 number of cases on the island down to                                 zero so they're starting to open                                 businesses back up this is a massive                                 success Taiwan border with China which                                 is the first place that the coronavirus                                 broke out and they were confronted with                                 making decisions before coronavirus was                                 as well understood as some of these                                 other places that I listed and yet                                 despite that they managed heap the                                 number of cases below a thousand and the                                 number of deaths below                                 now this is really really impressive so                                 what is different about these places now                                 we found our bright spots now we need to                                 figure out what makes these spots bright                                 spots so we've got Germany Finland New                                 Zealand and Taiwan what is different                                 about these places well let's look at                                 who leads these places I'm Lila miracle                                 I know miracle is shortly before her                                 retirement in politics she was able to                                 communicate the risks of pandemic very                                 clearly to the population incredibly                                 santamarina she's only                                              youngest serving state leader and                                                                                                            women you send the ardor and shut the                                  the economy of Finland down                                 extremely early it was a risk-averse                                 approach but it's brought New Zealand to                                 a place where they can now fully reopen                                 their economy and Sian Wayne used                                 testing and contact tracing very                                 intensively and very quickly in order to                                 control infections without a full                                 national lockdown so those numbers that                                 she managed to achieve were without a                                 full national lockdown so if we look at                                 these spaces do we see a pattern is                                 there something in common that these                                 people show well yes they're all women                                 contrast this was Donald Trump who has                                 chosen not to wear a mask because he                                 wouldn't portray himself as strong                                 enough that way or Boris Johnson who                                 basically tried to negotiate with the                                 virus and delayed lockdowns and other                                 measures so does that mean that women                                 make better decisions is that what I'm                                 trying to say well no that's not what                                 I'm trying to say at all but it is worth                                 noting that these are women maybe it's                                 not the fact that these are that these                                 women are the leaders of these countries                                 but rather the fact that these countries                                 were willing to elect women that these                                 were the best people for their roles in                                 the countries where these countries were                                 able to recognize that and put them into                                 those roles these four women are                                 stunningly capable and they were able to                                 rise to the main leadership positions in                                 their countries which doesn't just say                                 good things about them                                 also says good things about their                                 countries so what they manage to do is                                 they they come from a society that                                 values diversity uns and this is this is                                 an important point because avoiding                                 groupthink requires people with diverse                                 backgrounds to have a seat at the table                                 people need to feel safe bringing those                                 diverse perspectives to the table people                                 need to listen to and understand each                                 other's perspectives so diverse voices                                 matter Angela Merkel's government for                                 example considered a variety of                                 different sources in developing its                                 coronavirus policy so they included                                 epidemiological models they concluded                                 data for medical providers and they look                                 to South Korea for their successful                                 programming of testing in isolation they                                 were pulling in data from every                                 direction they could find it remember we                                 were saying that wicked problems our                                 system problems with multiple                                 interacting parts while working on these                                 problems requires more expertise than a                                 single person can bring to the table and                                 putting multiple people with the same                                 background and training at the table                                 isn't much better than just putting one                                 person at the table let's look at                                 another example this right here is a                                 picture of one of the engines of Qantas                                 flight                                                               engine exploded in the air the debris is                                 hit the left wing and knocked out                                 multiple other systems and but you see                                 this thing landed the crew managed to                                 land the plane safely so a group of                                 researchers closely examined the major                                 does airline disasters and crew training                                 and they examines the crisis                                 communication performed between the crew                                 members while solving these complex                                 problems with hundreds of lives of a                                 line under extreme high pressure the                                 researchers were especially interested                                 in those cases in which clearly the the                                 plane was landed safely so when they                                 examined those cases they found that the                                 crews that succeeded at those things did                                 two things right one thing the captain's                                 style of communication had a major                                 impact                                 performance first the crews performed                                 consistently better under intense                                 temperature when the co-pilot was                                 included in the decision-making process                                 that you would think well it's an                                 emergency that the captain needs to know                                 what to do and just tell everybody what                                 to do and then people need to do it but                                 that's not what's happening here when                                 the captain analyzed the problem alone                                 and simply gave orders the outcome was                                 worse because these problems are complex                                 and a single person can't understand                                 even the pilot cannot understand the                                 whole airplane so the seconds the                                 captain's who asked open-ended questions                                 that is how do you assess a situation                                 what options do you see what do you                                 suggest they ended up coming up with                                 better solutions and captain's who                                 simply ask yes or no questions so what                                 they gathered here with these                                 researchers gathered here was that when                                 captain's included their colleagues of                                 equal decision partners by asking them                                 questions this is a form of leadership                                 that IDI shine terms humble inquiry then                                 that taps into other people's expertise                                 and it aids them in bringing you                                 constructive and factual information so                                 societies which include diverse voices                                 are already more likely to be teaching                                 those values of listening careful                                 decision making then societies which                                 don't but there's also a reason to                                 believe that women specifically are                                 statistically better at this form of                                 including multiple voices so research                                 has shown that in high stakes situations                                 men tend to become more risk-taking                                 whereas women tend to look for smaller                                 safer gains and the quality of team                                 decision-making isn't determined by how                                 smart a team's members are surprisingly                                 the set is turned by how socially                                 sensitive the members of the group are                                 and how well they are able to leverage                                 the understanding and knowledge of the                                 full group of people women are                                 consistently more socially sensitive                                 this doesn't mean they men can't learn                                 it but statistically speaking women are                                 consistently more social even sensitive                                 and so researchers found the teams with                                 more women tend to have a higher group                                 IQ this is repeat this is a skill that                                 men can learn neither stop the value                                 so good leaders are not risk-takers they                                 value inclusive decision-making they                                 look to enable others and they practice                                 humble inquiry and they're empathetic so                                 coming back to the problem that we're                                 trying this off here how are women in                                 open-source combatant coronavirus so I'm                                 going to get specific concrete here now                                 I'm going to introduce four different                                 women working on four different                                 initiatives two of them are smaller and                                 more minor and solve a very localized                                 specific problem and two of them are                                 working on larger longer term problems                                 I'm going to start with sterling Peters                                 stormy is a leader in open source and                                 when she realized that a lot of these                                 conferences were failing or or being                                 cancelled                                 fortunately Berlin buzzwords is doing                                 just fine she started an open-source                                 hallway track she announced it on                                 Twitter and communicated it effectively                                 and leaders from all around the industry                                 somewhere between                                                   every week have shown up at these                                 meetings and talked to each other about                                 various aspects of open source from                                 diversity to open source programs                                 offices to the relationship between open                                 standards and open source code and                                 people have enlightened each other and                                 many people and networked itemo normally                                 has worked on online trainings in Apache                                 airflow Meredith Horowitz and a rather                                 large team not not to forget the team                                 have worked and this isn't new thongs                                 it's just something that's become pretty                                 particularly relevant now have been                                 working on a project called get your                                 refund which lower-income people can get                                 tax advice for free via a website and                                 it's a project from Code for America so                                 when the government brings out new                                 government assistance related to                                 coronavirus then the poor people at whom                                 it is targeted are now more able to get                                 those refunds via via this project so                                 the last project I want to talk to you                                 about I have invited somebody to talk to                                 you about it                                 um her name is Claire barn horn now                                 Claire barn learn is working on a                                 project called Sol hose and she's been                                 working on this for most of the last                                 year and a half so she was started to                                 work on it well before anybody knew                                 anything about coronavirus claire has                                 been interested in humanitarian aid all                                 of her life she has she studied it she's                                 worked in the field she's worked on the                                 ground working for example setting up a                                 field hospital in in condo work for                                 Doctors Without Borders                                 and in the process of doing that work                                 claire noticed that procurement was a                                 problem for these humanitarian                                 organizations so a procurement officer                                 who didn't know much about the space                                 would then go and do a lot of searching                                 to find for example an incubator and                                 then buy the incubator but made me                                 forget that she needs to account for                                 spare parts and for training or the                                 procurement officer might go to a                                 contractor and ask the contractor for                                 advice on how to do this in the                                 contractor charges lots of money for                                 something that he or she just did just                                 to for the the last organization just a                                 few days ago which means that the the                                 contractors get make a lot of money and                                 it's an inefficient process and clear                                 decided that she could see a way to                                 solve that and she started working on a                                 project called sofas which should solve                                 that I'm hoping that we can add Claire                                 to the stream now and we can start                                 asking her about this solution hello hi                                 nice to see you good thanks for the                                 introduction so can I ask you a couple                                 of questions absolutely excellent so                                 first off can you tell me how you got                                 interested in humanitarian aid that                                 started and then everybody can guess my                                 age in                                                                 Ethiopia and I was six years old and it                                 was his charity run at my high school of                                 Ed my primary school I was a first                                 grader and I came home running telling                                 my dad and mum that Ethiopia were hungry                                 I wasn't even know                                 to saying it was actually country but I                                 was just determined to run the charity                                 around so these two boys would not be                                 hungry any longer and that's basically                                 where I started and never never left                                 business so would you tell me a little                                 bit more about your background as well                                 you mentioned that you had been involved                                 in procurements how did you get into                                 that so I started studying tropical                                 agriculture at first at Wageningen                                 University in the Netherlands and I                                 became a master in disaster eventually I                                 did my masters in disaster studies                                 started to work in India started to do                                 another master's in Unitarian systems in                                 Dublin University and then I start                                 working with Doctors Without Borders and                                 that's what I did for many years and                                 actually in                                                         realizing that just due to the fact that                                 was collecting data on malnutrition                                 rates and I came into a situation or                                 people telling me that action console of                                 files and other organization was doing                                 the exact same things five or seven                                 years ago so my data was just a time                                 just that's at that moment in time I                                 knew something but at this day that                                 didn't it didn't tell me anything on is                                 it better or worse is it epidemic is                                 what's the data telling me more than                                 just these numbers so debts drove me                                 into data-driven innovation and                                 technology in the Unitarian sector and                                 that has led me eventually to be more                                 involved in innovation where I saw a lot                                 of duplication help opening up a lot of                                 yet for example clean cooking stoves                                 there's even a website on innovative                                 clean cooking stoves and it has more                                 than                                                                    but it's basically all comes down to the                                 same solution same innovation so there                                 was just a lot of duplication the same                                 time I've seen amazing innovations and                                 they're just chasing one eight agency                                 after the other trying to find a use                                 case they could actually provide value                                 to and I thought discs we can do more                                 systematically and we need a system                                 change in a sector and if we'd like to                                 open up the sector for innovations we                                 have to start looking at procurement and                                 that's why the procurement cycle came                                 into it                                 system came into the spots and that's                                 where actually our system approach is                                 now focusing on so in procurement you                                 mentioned that you've got a lot of                                 people bringing in products is that the                                 right approach is that how we're likely                                 to solve these problems coming up with                                 great new ideas and then trying to get                                 them to the aid agencies currently a lot                                 of that's that's common practice at the                                 moment there's a lot of discussions on                                 great innovations and how to scale                                 innovation so there's tremendous amount                                 of programs to scale innovations but if                                 you don't present them in the community                                 or in this sector eight sector for                                 humanitarian development agencies these                                 are the existing solutions it's so hard                                 to read them a to see what's the value                                 of it or how to even notice about them                                 if you're not at that same conference or                                 not being introduced at the right moment                                 so that's what we're doing we're trying                                 to make that systemic and open up these                                 systematically so how how do innovators                                 become aware                                 sorry how do you commit well yeah I know                                 innovators become aware of the problems                                 that they need to solve so what we're                                 having is basically a search engine an                                 open source catalog we call it an open                                 access catalog because knowledge is for                                 the Commons knowledge should be for                                 everybody and what we're doing if you                                 type in I need a generator because                                 you're building an outpatient clinic in                                 Uganda for example you don't get search                                 you can search it and do you needed                                 product generator or do you need a power                                 supply which is the identified need of                                 the keywords and then we go back and try                                 to take the the user on a journey with                                 us and we move away from Prada dominated                                 thinking into solutions into what's the                                 identified need that you're after so you                                 need a power supply alright great                                 we know it's a power supply what's the                                 next step is that a community power                                 supply a household power supply a                                 facility power supply and if you drill                                 down for example you need a community                                 power supply the key requirements or the                                 criteria on which you select your                                 solution package is then coming up so                                 that's where we work with a lot of                                 experts in the field to open up this                                 expertise so if it's a community power                                 supply you will have questions what's                                 the population                                 City what's the resource setting what's                                 the need etc what's the peak load what's                                 sun hours it's at all these little                                 details and the more you fill in the                                 more narrow your solution packages that                                 the platform will present you will be                                 because it will be more matching to your                                 requirements and I mean so you get                                 complete solutions that means that the                                 aid agencies can also see what the total                                 hosta is not just what the cost of that                                 one piece of equipment is there anything                                 here yes exactly so a solution package                                 we are after responsible procurement we                                 started with responsible innovation what                                 it's now responsible procurement exactly                                 the example you gave if you're after                                 reducing the rate of mortality of                                 children after childbirth an incubator                                 is exactly what you're after but an                                 incubator alone is not this is not a                                 responsible solution package with that                                 comes the assurance there's enough power                                 available for the next five years with                                 that comes a service a maintenance                                 contract for five years because the                                 lifespan is set as a five year force                                 such an incubator with that comes a                                 spare part kit with that comes a                                 training of nurses and if an agency has                                 one or multiple already available of                                 in-house they just uncheck that box and                                 they can sale it at solution packages                                 but you at least know what's what needs                                 to be in that solution package and                                 there's also the pre requirements so we                                 assume that the pre requirement for an                                 incubator is that there is enough power                                 available and this is the standard of                                 the power uninterupted obviously for an                                 incubator and if you don't have that you                                 just stick it and you go down the stream                                 again you would just add that to your                                 specific solution package for your                                 clinic in Uganda okay so the coronavirus                                 make this harder yeah actually it made                                 it more visible so we have done an                                 analysis of all the major pitfalls that                                 were addressing so I really mentioned                                 product dominated thinking we often have                                 a poor knowledge on how local solutions                                 work at field level or there's no                                 visibility of a local solution so we                                 have all these major pitfalls but                                 actually came a few that actually made                                 things worse in in in Africa for example                                 so complete supply chains already                                 collapsing here in I'm from the                                 Netherlands                                 moment that's where I'm based now so                                 supply chains already collapsing here                                 for businesses so imagine what it will                                 be for the                                                         supply chains are predominantly EU and                                 us centric and they are collapsing so we                                 have to invest in more localized                                 abilities to procure so our platform                                 made it even moon it was even more                                 necessary to move fast and speedy to                                 open up and there's also a lot of                                 competition and then talking here it is                                 all where everybody's working on open                                 source there is this whole new sector                                 that actually joined to support those in                                 need and the respondents in the                                 coronavirus crisis is is makers                                 community there's I've seen amazing                                 open-source designs the the                                             community just they exploded they all                                 start working together but these designs                                 is very hard to flow into the                                            and that's also what retraining                                 incorporate the solution package is a                                 combination of services designs and                                 products so also these open-source                                 designs can just create value not only                                 in your own community but far and far                                 beyond so how is that so those are open                                 source design to disseminating or there                                 are other ways in which the work you're                                 doing is open source yes so there's an                                 not a lot of people know that but                                 there's                                                                                                                                         on all the other countries in the world                                 and they all do their own procurement                                 and it's all having their own language                                 and when you're in data you know that                                 you have to have common semantics you                                 have to know that you compare apples                                 with apples and know the apples with                                 peers at least you know we're talking                                 about so we are providing and creating                                 now open standards and semantics that                                 can be shared within the sector so we                                 can combine everything and link                                 everything and creating open standards                                 for procurement and open standards for                                 our knowledgebase and similarly the the                                 solutions catalog as we call it so it's                                 merged with a tender platform I didn't                                 mention that part yet but the OPA                                 catalog of all these solutions and the                                 search base it's all open access                                 knowledge                                 okay so it can open source software make                                 your working more impactful in any way                                 obviously in the future                                 that's something it's high on our wish                                 list we have released for us things have                                 moved so fast because of the coronavirus                                 and we released a prototype in March                                                                                                       whole community got together to actually                                 start making providing value for the                                 current prices we're in so the speed                                 that we are with prevented us to do the                                 our preferred scenario so we're now                                 launching end of this summer and then                                 we're looking into rewriting and then                                 making continuing on an open source                                 coding a stream okay so this is this is                                 very very interesting but I'm going to                                 stop our conversation here so that                                 people have a chance to ask questions so                                 Nicole asked you mentioned that a patch                                 with interact-as Humana is a                                 humanitarian project can you say                                 something about its origin and motive                                 and are there other Apache projects with                                 a similar idea or purpose um so fin act                                 comes from the Grameen foundation                                 originally the Grameen foundation for                                 those who don't know does humanity this                                 microfinance that is this idea that if                                 you give people little tiny loans to                                 invest in their businesses they can pay                                 them back and you can keep using that                                 capital so this requires it's basically                                 creating banking solutions for                                 communities that didn't have them before                                 that so the Grammy Foundation started                                 creating these first the Grameen Bank                                 then the Grameen foundation started                                 creating these these little local banks                                 that called microfinance Institute's                                 institutions and the person we're                                 tracking stuff on paper with pencil and                                 that's difficult then they were doing                                 stuff with Excel and then they started                                 working on an open source banking                                 solution and that banking solution was                                 originally called me post it was that                                 the me post initiative was spun out of                                 the Graeme                                 nation and the meatless initiative                                 donated the back end of that project to                                 Apache and that's what Apache interact                                 is so the thus origin the project that                                 the motivation of the project is to make                                 it possible cheaper to offer banking                                 solutions to people who did not                                 previously have them and those there are                                 two billion people in the world who are                                 unbanked or underbanked                                 are there other Apache projects with a                                 similar idea of purpose most Apache                                 projects are fairly commercially                                 oriented and most effective projects are                                 less than complete projects and more                                 like libraries or components that work                                 with other components but I'd say yeah I                                 mean OpenOffice has similarities because                                 it made it possible for people to access                                 their their office document formats                                 whether they could afford Microsoft                                 software or not but in general no I                                 don't think there is another project at                                 Apache that's that has similar that                                 that's similar but the projects at                                 Apache are very different from each                                 other as well thank you very much thank                                 you Claire for joining for joining me                                 for this is this really interesting                                 conversation Solo's I think has a huge                                 amount of potential and I think also                                 that we have a lot of different people                                 working on the problem coronavirus and                                 humanitarian aid in general and if we                                 just we keep recognizing the                                 difficulties of the problem and                                 recognising the importance of different                                 perspectives that different people bring                                 to it that we have a real chance of                                 making a real difference oh yeah we have                                 a real chance of making a real                                 difference in the world so thank you                                 very much and have a wonderful evening                                 you
