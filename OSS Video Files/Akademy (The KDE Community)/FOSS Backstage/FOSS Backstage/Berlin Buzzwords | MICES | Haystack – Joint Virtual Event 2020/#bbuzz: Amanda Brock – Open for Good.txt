We know open source software, hardware and data are good, but sometimes they are also implemented and utilised for good purposes.

Amanda will talk about some of her experiences in tech, particularly Open technology being used to bank the unbanked and democratise poverty through various projects including implementation of open payment platforms, her work as Chair of the UN Technology Innovation Labs Open Source and IP Advisory and setting up the disaster response tools, Open Tech Response.

pretty much                                looking forward to a weekend in berlin                                coming to the conference                                hanging out with all of you guys and                                this was going to be the biggest week of                                my year this was also going to be open                                uk week                                and as deb said my main role in open                                source these days                                is that i am the ceo of open uk                                um i'm going to talk to you about open                                for good but i'm going to start by                                giving you a bit of context about open                                uk                                i don't know if it's an organization                                many of you will have heard of                                and open uk has existed for a while but                                really                                only sort of started to shine its light                                in the last six months                                and we are an advocacy and industry                                organization across the uk                                for open source technology or open                                technology                                and our vision is to develop and sustain                                uk leadership                                in open technology now for many of you                                you may not have heard those two words                                together                                or if you have you may have only heard                                them recently or not very often                                and it's something that's definitely                                worth paying attention to because i                                think it's very much the future of open                                and for us at open uk we've defined open                                technology                                and we've defined it as open source                                software open hardware                                and open data and of course at this                                point in time of innovation and                                development                                bringing those three together is                                critical i think we're probably the                                first organization to formalize that in                                our vision                                but i also believe that you will see                                many more organizations doing something                                similar                                and we we create that vision as a                                reality                                using the three key areas three                                three pillars of open and those are                                community                                legal and policy and education i'm just                                going to talk a little bit about what                                each of those mean for us                                so in terms of community we're trying to                                build a really visible and loud open                                community across the uk                                and uh what we found unsurprisingly and                                you probably see this in your own                                geographic                                areas is that we're not necessarily                                terribly joined up by geography                                within the open communities most of us                                if you're anything like me or the people                                i know                                will have worked in projects where we                                really enjoy the international                                collaborations that we do and we work                                with people all over the globe and                                that's important to us                                and of course that should never change                                but what we've discovered                                is that often people work on projects                                and know their um                                colleagues on those projects but may not                                 know their neighbors                                 uh lockdown has been a revelation for me                                 in the uk and i've discovered that                                 a lady at microsoft who i i've actually                                 been working with in an open data                                 project                                 lives across the street from me                                 literally a hundred yards from me                                 and we've become prime friends through                                 lockdown so                                 what we want to do is build this                                 community as a strong                                 visible loud community across the uk                                 by engaging people and engaging them in                                 events                                 in our digital interactions through                                 different projects                                 and one way we were going to do that was                                 hosting open uk week which was to take                                 place as i said this week                                 i'll talk a little bit more about that                                 later but it's now moved to october                                 and like uh berlin buzzwords is mostly                                 going to be online if not entirely                                 online                                 the second area and we're actually very                                 strong in this one in the uk                                 is legal and policy                                 and we want to make sure that the uk                                 becomes a great place to do open                                 um we were really really pleased                                 that we were able to speak with the uk                                 trade international trade people back in                                 february now those people                                 were negotiating and still are                                 negotiating all the replacement treaties                                 being put in place                                 around the brexit exit from europe                                 so we were able to go and speak to them                                 and advise them and                                 guide them with respect to the use of                                 source code provisions in those treaties                                 as they would                                 impact open source we also                                 review and monitor new legislation                                 currently still in europe                                 um we're still there at the end of the                                 year but also primarily in the uk and                                 we're building engagements with uk                                 government to try and work more and more                                 on the                                 policies and practices and we've also                                 established within that legal and policy                                 group                                 something called future leaders and                                 that's something you might be interested                                 in                                 i think again we're the first to to have                                 created that                                 anywhere in the globe but what we've                                 done is we've realized that we're all                                 getting on a bit                                 so frankly we have a bunch of people in                                 this legal and policy group who are                                 really                                 established in open but we're all in our                                                                             and we need to make sure the next                                 generation is going to come through and                                 carry on this work                                 no point in building something if it's                                 not sustainable right                                 so what we've done is engage with                                 uh legal and policy people business                                 people we don't yet have developers but                                 we'd love to have some developers engage                                 in it                                 and we are mentoring them and leading                                 them through                                 a review of uk government terms when it                                 comes to                                 procurement that will impact open so ccs                                 gds and the nhs terms across the uk                                 we will produce a paper reviewing those                                 which will be written by the leaders of                                 that future leaders group                                 and we will host a seminar probably with                                 the open chain project                                 in the autumn with uk golf that group                                 needed some training and most of the                                 people involved know a bit about open                                 but they're learning and they want to                                 learn more                                 so what we did was pull together a few                                 training sessions                                 that um started i think in april                                 uh they're at noon every friday noon uk

                               and the open movement                                 we started with what you might expect                                 compliance                                 governance patents trademarks the really                                 practical things that would impact                                 anybody with a support background around                                 open                                 and we've just flipped as of this week                                 into looking at some of the community                                 topics we start on friday with neil                                 mcgovern                                 who as you probably know is the                                 executive director of the gnome                                 foundation                                 neil's talking about opening the desktop                                 we have jonathan riddle the next week                                 from kde                                 talking about apps and open and the week                                 after we have matt                                 um jarvis talking about contribution to                                 community projects and that will go                                 on picking up hardware and data into the                                 summer                                 we have a break in august and then we                                 come back in september and we pivot to                                 the commercials so we talk about uh                                 business models we have people you will                                 know uh like frank carlishak                                 um from nexcloud and                                 uh rancher shane coughlin from open                                 chain talking about the business side of                                 open                                 now i mentioned those a little bit more                                 length than you maybe would expect me to                                 in a talk about open for good but i                                 would encourage you to take a look                                 they're free to attend anyone can attend                                 and they are available as recordings                                 afterwards                                 every time i watch one of them i learned                                 something new so that's the second                                 challenge the second tranche is legal in                                 policy which sits with building our                                 community                                 and then of course as a third piece                                 which is education and learning                                 and we focus that across primary                                 secondary and tertiary education                                 we have a universities group who should                                 this week have had a three-day                                 posse professors open source software                                 education                                 that's a project run by google and red                                 hat in the us                                 they were coming to the uk to do uh                                 training                                 for our professors unfortunately i think                                 that's probably a face-to-face event                                 we've pushed it provisionally back to                                 october could be next year                                 that group is also looking at across                                 student collaboration                                 um entering a competition and we then                                 have a secondary school                                 so ages                                                               on building a qualification an                                 educational exam qualification                                 possibly something we call a gcse here                                 not definitely                                 we want to launch that by the end of                                                                                                         with the pandemic but that's something                                 that's very dear to my heart making sure                                 that we're not just educating kids and                                 how to                                 learn a language how to build in python                                 or                                 for a little kid scratch but actually                                 teach them what open means                                 and we're also aware that many of the                                 best developers                                 are not focused on the traditional                                 educational routes you know they don't                                 find doing gcses or whatever the exams                                 conducive to their way of working so                                 we're working with a number of major                                 companies                                 and with uh the education authorities to                                 try to build                                 um an apprenticeship scheme where people                                 will learn on the job hands-on                                 how to be an open engineer and then i                                 guess finally we                                 we're looking at little kids and with                                 the little kids we're engaging with a                                 number of                                 organizations who are currently                                 providing code camps and the like                                 to take them a step further and actually                                 teach kids                                 about what open means not just the                                 technologies                                 so um one of the the the many                                 many events that were impacted or victim                                 to the pandemic was the open uk kids                                 competition                                 this is something i was very proud of                                 and in fact i feel like i sweated blood                                 the first part of this year to get it in                                 place and then of course                                 along came coronavirus and off with my                                 my competition                                 um in short it was a competition                                 designed                                 for kids to build this                                 glove and then compete with each other                                 creating something that was                                 uh original and creative using the glove                                 uh which is a software glove                                 the glove was designed originally by the                                 singer                                 imogen heap double grammy award-winning                                 singer imogen heap about                                              i worked with imaging on the prototype                                 and there was always an intention that                                 at least                                 aspects of it would be open and that's                                 what i was involved in                                 um the glove was picked up by aaron                                 grandy who toured about five years ago                                 with it                                 and last year this mini moo glove this                                 kit was released                                 now the glove is built the kids glove is                                 built on a micro bit a bbc micro bit                                 and that little board is used                                 to power the musical capacity of                                 the glove the glove can be used for                                 other things but primarily it's an                                 instrument                                 i'm really excited to say that the glove                                 has been open sourced as part of our                                 project                                 and you if you were to buy a kit                                 you would get all aspects but you can                                 know if you happen to have a micro bit                                 download the instructions to build the                                 glove download the                                 template to cut around your hand and                                 also                                 um you i think you still have to buy the                                 little speaker i don't think there's any                                 way of creating that little piece of                                 hardware                                 but it's inexpensive now the the idea                                 was that we were having kids competing                                 in teams of four each team sharing one                                 glove kit that we would thanks to red                                 hat sponsorship for giving the kids                                 and then we would bring winners to                                 london this thursday                                 to have a code camp in the red hat                                 innovation                                 lab and then to compete with imogen heat                                 there to judge                                 obviously i cannot ask for kids to share                                 a glove anymore                                 i don't think many of their parents                                 would let me move them around the uk                                 this year let alone this week so we had                                 to let that go                                 but what we've done instead not to be                                 beaten by it                                 is create a smaller course                                 a smaller competition rather and an                                 additional course                                 so we have a competition taking place in                                 september                                 the winners will be announced at the                                 open uk awards they're part of open uk                                 week and they take place on the                                         october                                 if any of you are in the uk or no folk                                 in the uk                                 nominations have just been extended from                                 the from                                                       right through to                                                      nominate people to participate                                 or to be considered for an award in open                                 source software hardware data                                 as an individual or a young person and                                 then of course there will be a kids                                 winner                                 and what we've done with the kids is not                                 just have this smaller competition                                 but also we are giving each child their                                 own gloves so they won't share                                 and we've sent those out to them over                                 the last week or so                                 and we've developed a                                            animated course on open so the first                                 session                                 is animated by the singer imogen heap                                 really brilliant                                 it looks wonderful um and imogen of                                 course is fabulous                                 uh very experienced and doing that kind                                 of thing but what i like                                 best about it is that we're not just                                 teaching the kids how to make the glove                                 imogen explains in the first episode                                 what open source is                                 so we then have nine further episodes                                 coming out weekly                                 and each one explains an aspect of open                                 source to the kids and helps their                                 learning and development                                 as well as giving them a fun activity                                 now that's currently being run                                 in a closed environment for only the                                 kids in the competition                                 but we plan over the summer vacation to                                 bring that                                 to a much broader group of kids it's                                 being released                                 creative commons cc by sa which will                                 allow other organizations                                 to talk to us have the script uh                                 translate it                                 and have the course run in other                                 languages too so i hope we'll get the                                 chance to work with maybe nina and                                 people in germany and other countries on                                 doing some translations and sharing for                                 our kids                                 so the final thing i want to mention to                                 you about open uk is the ditto project                                 and it's the first truly open for good                                 project that i've mentioned today                                 um ditto stands for develop in the open                                 and the project is funded by innovate uk                                 now this project has                                         pounds of funding a small part of that's                                 going to open uk                                 so that we can contribute around                                 governance                                 legal and policy and we are working to                                 to make the project open chain compliant                                 the project is producing an e-op system                                 an e-observation system for hospitals                                 and once that's created it's something                                 that will be able to scale at a low cost                                 and be very interoperable                                 across different health authorities in                                 the uk and internationally                                 so well worth taking a look at                                 so how did a nice girl like me end up in                                 a space like this                                 well uh early in                                      i had been a corporate commercial and                                 tech lawyer                                 working in a number of big companies                                 managing legal teams developing legal                                 teams                                 and i was asked if i would go to a                                 company called canonical                                 in this slightly odd open source field                                 that i'd heard of but didn't know much                                 about                                 um for three months and if i would go                                 and help them scope what                                 they would do with their legal team and                                 then i was going to move to amazon to                                 work on an electrical retail project                                 that i assume would have been the kindle                                 uh something very unexpected happened to                                 me at canonical which was that                                 i went in there to help them to build                                 something to be a lawyer                                 to create a legal environment and i find                                 very quickly that i found a real home                                 somewhere that i felt i belonged and i                                 really                                 probably uh you could say i went native                                 and i discovered that i belonged in this                                 open source community                                 now for anyone who doesn't know                                 canonical it's one of if not the biggest                                 open source company in europe                                 headquartered in london                                 founded by mark shuttleworth and it is                                 the commercial                                 sponsor of the open source operating                                 system ubuntu                                 and when i started there ubuntu was the                                 desktop of choice and it was very much                                 at the forefront of the open desk shop                                 for the development community in the                                 time that i was there i was there five                                 years                                 what we found was that it spread much                                 much broader                                 and it became one of the underpinning                                 technologies for client                                 platform i'm quoting simon wardley here                                 but who was the director of cloud at the                                 time at canonical and i think we were                                 something like                                          he says of the cloud marketplace um back                                 in                                       now that hasn't necessarily changed a                                 lot and what we see                                 is that open source software like uh                                 ubuntu sits                                 under almost all platform technology and                                 i'll come back to that later in the                                 presentation                                 as i said i have a number of roles so as                                 well as being ceo                                 open uk i'm a european representative                                 of oin the open invention network um                                 my involvement with oin goes back to my                                 days at canonical                                 we made a conscious decision when i ran                                 the legal team                                 not to patent any of our technology or                                 innovation                                 and instead what we did was contribute                                 financially to the infrastructure that                                 builds oin                                 um oin is the world's biggest defensive                                 intellectual property organization uh                                 it's probably not strictly open for good                                 but it does a lot of good                                 and it is a collaboration across                                 organizations                                 where every company person or                                 organization who participates                                 signs up to an agreement that agreement                                 says that if they hold patents                                 they will license those patents for free                                 to everybody else in the group                                 to the extent those patents read on a                                 definition that definition is called the                                 linux system definition                                 and it's a list of packages and you'll                                 find it on openinventionnetwork.com                                 website so everybody agrees the same                                 contract                                 nobody pays to join it's free for                                 everyone nobody's restricted from                                 joining                                 anybody can join go to oim's website and                                 you can participate                                 and everybody signs the same deal                                 offering their patents up and this                                 license to everybody else and receiving                                 the same back                                 the the companies involved are                                 wide-ranging lots of automotive mobile                                 companies                                 tech companies but much much broader                                 these days fashion houses                                 recruitment consultants all sorts of                                 companies who use or develop technology                                 that's open and we at canonical actually                                 became one of the funders who                                 paid for the infrastructure along with                                 the initial founders                                 sony nec phillips ibm red hat                                 and navel suse we have a couple of new                                 funders google and nissan and also as                                 well as canonical tom tom was an                                 associate member so back in the day at                                 canonical i sat on the board but when i                                 left i made a conscious decision that i                                 wanted to keep that involvement                                 that the work oin does is really                                 important to me and to our community                                 anybody who either creates distributes                                 or                                 uses open source software ought to be a                                 licensee of oin                                 the only reason not to be frankly is                                 that you want to be a patent aggressor                                 and if you've seen the recent gnome                                 litigation which                                 oin supported the gnome foundation when                                 they were attacked by                                 the rothschild patent non-practicing                                 entity or troll                                 you'll see what happens when the open                                 source community is really taking on                                 on the patent front and of course uh the                                 the victory that gnome foundation had                                 was amazing                                 and they not only got a patent license                                 for themselves but for                                 the whole open source community covering                                 all the patents held by the the                                 rothschild non-practicing entity                                 so one of the the things that i work on                                 is oin

 veach foundation have given us funding                                 which means that the book will be open                                 access now originally it was going to be                                 published this year and we've pushed it                                 back because of the pandemic                                 it will be published in january i hope                                 i'll get to actually meet many of you                                 face to face at fosdem next year                                 and we'll be launching the book formally                                 at fosdem fingers crossed that will take                                 place and we'll all be in brussels                                 and then i guess finally my final sort                                 of open role is                                 things like this i spend a lot of my                                 time talking to people in the open

which talks about the track and trace                                 apps any of you who've seen anything                                 i've done recently will know that i've                                 been following the track and trace apps                                 pushing for them to be open-sourced and                                 making sure that there's a                                 a way for us to find out how they've                                 been open-sourced                                 uh licensing etc across europe and

             and that these are based on a shared                                 blueprint for peace and prosperity                                 for people on the planet the

that these must go hand in hand with                                 improving health and education                                 that we need to spur economies and                                 reduce climate change                                 probably never been more important than                                 it is at this time                                 as we come out of lockdown and deal with                                 the the outputs of the pandemic                                 and the aim of these goals the economic                                 goals is to meet the un's                                             and to make it a reality and that agenda                                 is pretty much a summary of the un's                                 goals for the people                                 for planet and prosperity and they aim                                 to do it through                                 ownership from all stakeholders to make                                 it a reality                                 now the sustainable development goals                                 also work with nine digital principles                                 if you look on my slide down to the                                 right in the middle you'll see                                 that uh there's a definition there for                                 or a principle there which is to use                                 open standards open data                                 open source and open innovation that                                 open source can probably mean software                                 or hardware                                 and frankly it's another definition of                                 this open technology phrase that i                                 started off with                                 showing you that it's been used other                                 places                                 now these were developed these nine                                 principles to address                                 failures and development of technology                                 in international organizations                                 and to allow sharing best practices in                                 the use of ict tools in international                                 development                                 they unify the unified principles were                                 pulled together                                 over time across a number of                                 organizations in the unified work that                                 was done                                 by unicef the world health or health                                 organization                                 the world bank and the um melinda gates                                 foundation                                 so absolutely critical to the work that                                 until does                                 and until's philosophy is that when                                 technology succeeds in solving a problem                                 in our likes it becomes invisible                                 the ticking of a clock so constant has                                 to fade into the background                                 but too often we begin to take this                                 transformative force for granted                                 the technology is not by its nature an                                 inclusive phenomenon                                 its availability in every context cannot                                 be assumed and as the clock ticks on                                 unnoticed                                 lives are lost i don't think there's                                 much that can sum up the importance of                                 technology being inter                                 open open to us all more than that                                 and you'll see there are already four                                 labs across the globe and another half                                 dozen are more planned in different                                 countries                                 so i was approached just over a year ago                                 to create the                                 os and ip advisory group and to give you                                 some context we work on a wide array of                                 projects from the four labs                                 those have included to date a blockchain                                 land registry for afghanistan                                 a platform that measures charities                                 impacts                                 gamification of literacy in the                                      century                                 and maternal health for parents pretty                                 wide ranging and there's a whole                                 raft more projects that we've worked on                                 so the group that we pulled together                                 are primarily in europe although we do                                 have members in asia and the us                                 and the group is mandated to maintain a                                 framework that enables until to foster                                 shareable or open technologies                                 and catalyze the creation of digital                                 solutions to build interoperable                                 solutions that can scale across member                                 states                                 it's really important to me that as many                                 of the projects as possible are open                                 and by default they will be                                 i would say this is a bit of a motley                                 crew this is not my wording this is                                 i should probably realize the un's                                 wording and we are a group according to                                 them with renowned experts in the legal                                 and technology innovation fields                                 uh i'm not going to read it all out to                                 you but this group of people                                 um actually a few of them are based in                                 germany and definitely known to you so                                 you probably all know merco                                 you'll know isabelle dress from from                                 apache and frank kolishek                                 founder of nexcloud so it's not just                                 lawyers it's not just policy people                                 you know we have community people we                                 have people running open                                 companies or companies that use open                                 economists                                 policy people all sorts involved in this                                 group                                 and that the purpose is very much for us                                 to get a broad community                                 and a broad understanding from that                                 grassroots base                                 into the projects but it's not just this                                 small group that can work on the                                 until projects we have the ability to                                 contribute as individual members of                                 communities by                                 contributing to the projects being run                                 out of the labs                                 and you can see more details of those                                 individual projects on the website                                 the un is also in process of building a                                 fellowship program                                 that will allow internships for                                 individuals with sponsorship from                                 companies                                 so that they can join a pro bono basis                                 to work in the labs                                 and something i would recommend strongly                                 so why does this matter                                 i care about open source not just being                                 good software                                 i care about open projects not just                                 being good projects but being used for                                 good but why would anybody else care                                 well he cares i care um but you could                                 say of course those two would care they                                 work and open that's all they do                                 let's think about it practically so from                                 a coding perspective                                 it's really important that when projects                                 are being built                                 on these in these international                                 organizations on the basis that they've                                 got to be scalable across countries                                 that they're going to allow access to                                 the code                                 and that we can see that that code is                                 secure before it's rolled out and scaled                                 it's critical both to keep the member                                 states and the governmental and                                 supranational organizations honest but                                 also for us to be able to contribute fix                                 bugs                                 it's easier to meet compliance                                 requirements the code will be                                 interoperable it can be visible we can                                 work with it across different projects                                 it also allows as codes rolled out                                 country per country particularly in                                 developing countries                                 for them to engage and i'll talk more                                 about that later because it is a very                                 important thing                                 but as it becomes scalable within                                 country they're able to                                 learn how to code learn how to                                 contribute and learn how to be part of a                                 project themselves                                 so that collaboration in country means                                 that it's not just a fix for the problem                                 or                                 a scratch for a niche as linus would say                                 that actually encourages ownership of a                                 project                                 at the local level you may be familiar                                 with the phrase give a man a fish and                                 you've given them a meal give                                 a teach a man to fish and you'll feed                                 them for life and that's pretty much                                 what these projects allow us to do                                 um we should all use open technology                                 wherever we can                                 and that is something that even                                 a company like microsoft today would                                 agree with so we've not just seen these                                 international organizations                                 pay lip service and start to move                                 towards it but we've seen at the                                 essence of business major companies some                                 of whom                                 really did not like open source to start                                 with making that mind shift                                 and i guess we have to wonder why and                                 how that happened and                                 if you've seen me speak before you'll                                 know i use this slide a lot                                 um so this is a very squishy picture                                 it's not not very flattering for my                                 peripheral steve wally but my friend                                 steve wolly was presenting                                 at the open source summit at the linux                                 foundation in edinburgh                                      in fact he was keynoting it and he was                                 keynoting it along with keith bergel of                                 oin the ceo of in                                 one after the other because microsoft                                 had just signed up to oin                                 you'll remember i mentioned oin you get                                 access to microsoft's patents to the                                 extent they read an open source                                 if you uh become part of oin                                 and what steve was explaining was the                                 journey that microsoft had been on                                 and how a company that                                                 years ago hated open                                 very publicly the company with the ceo                                 who described open source as a cancer                                 can move to the slide that you see now                                 in this picture of sasha nadal                                 asking to be judged by microsoft's                                 actions of today                                 actions where at least according to                                 github microsoft is now the biggest                                 single contributor to open source in the                                 world                                 where did that come from well steve                                 would tell you it's three things                                 ten years ago clients didn't ask                                 microsoft for open source                                 today they do clearly money counts                                 obviously that makes perfect sense                                 i mentioned already the change when i                                 was at canonical where we saw open move                                 from the desktop etc                                 into the the platform and cloud                                 environment                                 in fact i'm doing a talk in two weeks                                  time two weeks today about                                  i think it's called i know what it's                                  called it's my talk                                  it's open under the cloud so that talk                                  um                                  looks at the different technologies and                                  how the                                  the platform economy would not exist                                  without open and microsoft have                                  acknowledged that                                  for them to be able to work in platform                                  services they have to be able to                                  understand and use open technology                                  therefore they have to be pro-open and                                  finally the third reason is the                                  development community                                  particularly those born since                                           year the the                                  linux kernel was created those people                                  have grown up with open as a norm                                  and those developers expect nothing but

with this little shop                                  and this little shop had uh stickers                                  across it from all the major                                  mobile networks in pakistan and you'll                                  see here                                  sitting on the counter biometrics                                  machine now these two gentlemen were                                  excessively proud of that biometrics                                  machine pakistan has biometrics for all                                  its nationals                                  national database and this gentleman                                  polished the machine for several minutes                                  before i was allowed to take this                                  picture and in the store there were a                                  few of people                                  each of them holding a wad of cash their                                  id                                  and a photocopy of their id and as they                                  came to the counter they would hand over                                  the cash they would use the biometrics                                  to have their fingers printed and for                                  them to be checked                                  and the prepared pre-prepared                                  copy of their id would go into a little                                  book                                  as a receipt it handed the cash and                                  within seconds                                  the joys of technology that cash would                                  be transferred                                  somewhere else across the world                                  sometimes to                                  uh in the particular case of the                                  gentleman i was speaking to in the queue                                  in the line                                  um to his father he was a sheep farmer                                  in the mountains of pakistan                                  and his father was going to be able to                                  collect from the local trader there                                  wasn't even a shop in his village the                                  trader would likely be there once a week                                  on a street corner                                  selling whatever vegetable was in season                                  possibly tomatoes that week                                  along with handing out cash or                                  phone credits that have been received                                  via these digital transactions                                  so you were able to cash out now that                                  is probably a bit interesting but what's                                  really interesting about it is that                                  in this pakistan and many of these other                                  countries                                  there was a huge population without                                  access to financial services without                                  access to a bank account                                  no bank cards no ability to borrow money                                  and these digital infrastructures being                                  built through                                  mobile phone networks were allowing                                  access to                                  financial inclusion from many many poor                                  rich people                                  i think the start um                                                    changed because of the pandemic but i                                  think the star                                  at the start of the pandemic stat was                                                                       billion people across the globe still                                  living in poverty                                  and a need for them to receive                                  financial uh services                                  however that was going to be but with                                  the ability to skip ahead of those of us                                  in the west with our                                  bank structures and that was great and i                                  was really proud of the work we were                                  doing now because i felt we were doing                                  something useful                                  but there was one problem with it it                                  wasn't open source                                  and what i discovered in the last five                                  years is that banking has moved                                  to open source projects um or                                  organizations like the women linda gates                                  foundation and the world council of                                  credit unions have led the way in that                                  the gates foundation have recently spun                                  off uh the mojolip foundation i'd                                  recommend                                  anybody interested in fintech take a                                  look at this                                  it's an open source payment platform                                  which has actually been rolled out                                  already in                                  uh ivory coast and tanzania                                  doing exactly what the the structures                                  that we were talking about i was talking                                  about before pakistan was doing you can                                  see some more information about it there                                  and i would recommend you take a look at                                  that site                                  but what's happened here is that to                                  create this financial inclusion                                  there have been five pillars of                                  financial change where open has been                                  used for good                                  and those are around the fact that it                                  needs to be accessible by all which open                                  is it needs to meet or exceed the                                  convenience of cost and utility of cash                                  which of course digital financial                                  services can do                                  it needs to be open to drive competition                                  and open innovation                                  expands the services offered on a                                  sustainable model and it's very very                                  scalable across                                  developing countries now                                  just before i wrap up i'm conscious that                                  i've taken up a lot of your time today                                  and you may have some questions i want                                  to chat                                  i want to talk about one last open for                                  good initiative that i'm involved with                                  and this is very recent um                                  i have a certain opinion of the open                                  source community so it was no surprise                                  to me                                  when we went into lockdown that talking                                  to others in our community                                  i was constantly being told about great                                  new projects that people were spinning                                  up                                  projects that would create open                                  ventilators respirators                                  try to help people with financial                                  problems create educational platforms                                  etc                                  but what i find very quickly that as we                                  were talking about projects                                  i was seeing duplication of these                                  projects across different countries                                  and i was on a call talking about all                                  suppose of all things with a chat called                                  jacob green                                  at mosslabs.io and we were talking about                                  i suppose but                                  most labs had come out of the                                  john hopkins university which of course                                  many of you will know                                  is the the home of the coronavirus                                  dashboard the dashboard that's become                                  the                                  the base point for all of our                                  understanding of                                  um tracking the pandemic                                  so obviously jacob and i both had a                                  strong interest                                  in what was happening across the open                                  communities and we realized that there                                  was this duplication we were seeing at                                  different places                                  and we knew that there was a need to                                  pull people together and create a space                                  where we could find out about each                                  other's projects                                  so what we did was uh jacob initially                                  created                                  a slack workspace which then had a riot                                  layer built onto it so that we've got an                                  open source                                  uh offering as well and that was just a                                  place                                  for people to come into different                                  channels and talk about the work they                                  were doing on specific                                  areas or projects to make other projects                                  aware of their projects                                  to let people know if they needed help                                  i'll give you a couple of examples                                  so we shared across a number of projects                                  working on open ventilators                                  this article that was published in the                                  journal of open law technology and                                  society jobs                                  called breathing breathe out and this                                  article helps to explain                                  how to use an open hardware license on a                                  ventilator an open ventilator                                  we shared a nasa project from the jet                                  propulsion lab there                                  which was for                                                        and which was also uh available on an                                  open license                                  and we're taking that now as of today                                  one step further                                  so i'm sort of giving you a preview of a                                  press release that will go out tomorrow                                  by tomorrow morning if you look up

       beyond covert                                      um i don't like being the voice of doom                                  and gloom and didn't want to be the                                  person saying and when we have our next                                  disaster                                  but when we have our next disaster we're                                  ready for it we have these tools in                                  place                                  to help the open tech community spin out                                  their solutions

                          think                                  um i'm gonna leave at night deb                                  to bring me back to whether or not we                                  have                                  any questions from the audience                                  great thank you amanda for sharing some                                  of the amazing work that you have been                                  doing                                  and the many interesting initiatives                                  around open source                                  so uh for everyone please ask your                                  questions in the slack channel studio                                  uh we still have like five minutes for a                                  few questions                                  there is uh so to start there is a                                  question from isabel who                                  uh clearly we are impressed by what                                  you're doing with open uk so the                                  question is                                  like is are there any plans to extend                                  the initiative to                                  other countries to germany the eu for                                  instance                                  it's interesting um he's very flattering                                  and i would be very happy to work with                                  anybody we've been approached by a                                  couple of countries                                  and we've been having a conversation                                  with jacob's greens ospo project                                  on the basis that it would make sense                                  because open uk seems to have come                                  together well                                  to take some of the things that we've                                  done and replicate them and share                                  so we will look at building a country                                  specific ospo                                  making us a sort of open source program                                  office for countries                                  and offering that model to anybody who                                  wants it i wouldn't presume that                                  everybody should use what we've done it                                  just seems to have worked quite well                                  um and we're happy to share everything                                  that we're doing is available                                  on an open license and you know                                  take it run with it if you want to do                                  some of the stuff that's there                                  it sort of makes me smile because the                                  first time i was asked to be involved in                                  open uk i said no                                  i wasn't interested in a country                                  specific organization                                  and i was persuaded otherwise largely                                  because of brexit so it's a little bit                                  ironic that i wanted to make sure we                                  didn't get cut adrift                                  and to make sure that our community knew                                  each other so we could keep engaging                                  internationally                                  that now we've got other countries                                  talking to us about whether we can help                                  them                                  um i'd be really keen if anybody in any                                  country                                  um is interested in the kids competition                                  i'd rather the kids course rather i'd                                  really be keen to talk to you                                  because we have the script all we need                                  to do is create a translation                                  and have a voiceover done and you have                                  this brilliant                                                    it was developed by a guy called david

                               great thanks uh i hope that answers your                                  question isabel like i guess you anyway                                  noise where she will

                        the open which is a iuk                                  funded project for the nhs um there is                                  a report coming out probably next week                                  from                                  osor the observatory in europe it's                                  currently                                  with open uk's legal and policy group                                  and we're doing some updating for them                                  and collaborating with them on that                                  i think it has about                                                 listed                                  and we will add a couple more to that                                  i don't know whether you're aware of the                                  work nhsx is doing but nhsx                                  their policy is to release on an open                                  basis i guess there's some restrictions                                  around that                                  and they released at least the front end                                  of our track and trace app on that basis                                  but we do intend to be doing a lot more                                  work with the public sector to try to                                  see                                  more engagement and to ensure that more                                  projects are public                                  uh you can contact us at hello at
