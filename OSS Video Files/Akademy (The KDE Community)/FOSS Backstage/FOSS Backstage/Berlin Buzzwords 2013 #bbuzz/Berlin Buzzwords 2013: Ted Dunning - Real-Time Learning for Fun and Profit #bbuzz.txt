Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2013: Ted Dunning - Real-Time Learning for Fun and Profit #bbuzz
Publication date: 2013-06-19
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2013 #bbuzz
Description: 
	I will describe how real-time Bayesian learning can optimize real processes. These processes can be web-sites, user interfaces, ad-targeting servers, back-end server farms, search engines or physical systems. Google, Microsoft and Yahoo have all adopted the algorithms described in this talk for ad targeting because they produce superior results, but you don't have to be on that scale to benefit as well.

In this talk, the audience will learn the basic ideas behind effective real-time learning, but also see detailed implementation techniques and learn how to architect effective testing systems. I will also cover methods for starting gently without massive system upheavals and how to build consensus around how real-time learning and optimization. The focus throughout the talk will be on practical methods that can be applied in real life.
