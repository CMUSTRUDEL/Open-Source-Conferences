Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2013: Eric Evans - Cassandra By Example: Data modeling with CQL3 #bbuzz

Description: 
	Apache Cassandra is an increasingly popular choice of data store. Its write-optimized storage and shared-nothing distribution make it attractive for large, high-throughput data sets, or where availability and fault-tolerance are a concern. However, in spite of recent strides in usability, and rapidly maturing high-level interfaces, data modeling continues to be a source of confusion for many.

With the release of Cassandra 1.2 comes the 3rd iteration of the Cassandra Query Language, or CQL. CQL3 introduces improved support for wide rows through a novel use of compound columns; Per-row, normalized structures can now be stored, and efficiently queried using an SQL-like query syntax that should be second-nature to most developers.

This talk will take you step-by-step through a simple, open-source demo application modeled for Cassandra using CQL3, and provide the background needed to understand the model and query access.
