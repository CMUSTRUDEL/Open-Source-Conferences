Description: 
	You've gone to the talks on Hadoop / SOLR / NoSQL / etc, and now you're ready to start building your own solution on top of that! Before you go diving in though, we want to make sure you don't accidentally end up re-inventing the wheel while building your system...

In this talk, we'll take a look at a range of projects from the Apache Software Foundation that can help in building your big data solution, alongside the headline projects. While we can't cover every project at Apache (there are just too many these days!), we'll take a tour through some of the up-coming and lesser-known established projects out there that should prove very helpful to you in building your big data solution. We'll see that Apache is more than just the webserver, Hadoop and Lucene, and with any luck point you at projects that'll save you time!
