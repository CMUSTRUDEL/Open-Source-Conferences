Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2013: Uwe Schindler - Testing Lucene & Solr with various JVMs (...) #bbuzz

Description: 
	When Oracle released Java 7 GA in July 2011, it contained a serious loop optimization bug, affecting Apache projects like Lucene and Solr. Without a public warning posted to the users it may have happened that lots of Lucene indexes were corrupted by misbehaving optimization code in Oracle's Hotspot compiler. Unfortunately the bug was found too late, so Oracle had no time to fix or disable the optimizations.

Since detection of this problem, the Lucene committers were working on including various JVMs from different vendors - in combination with various optimization settings, platforms, word sizes, and garbage collectors - into their Jenkins builds. In combination with Lucene's random testing framework this helps to detect bugs early and warn users with an updated list of broken Java versions. Lucene committers found bugs in JVMs from other vendors, too, leading to corrupt indexes. Not only having static tests but also those using repeatable random number generators to generate test data also helped to find other bugs in the Java class library (e.g., regular expressions, BreakIterators, localization issues).

This talk will present the techniques used to customize Jenkins to randomly select JDKs and optimization options. Unfortunately this is not yet done on Apache's own Jenkins build farm; but to widen the number of different Java installations and operating systems, several sponsored external servers are used to run the thorough, randomized Lucene/Solr test suite 24/7, selecting Java versions from a huge list of options. The talk will also present some bugs (including the famous Java 7 bug) and risky optimization settings commonly applied by users.
