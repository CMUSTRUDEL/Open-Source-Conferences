Description: 
	Full title: "Bug bites Elephant: Test-driven Quality Assurance in Big Data Application Development"

Around the currently available large piles of Big Data, there's happening quite a mixed gathering: Business Engineers define which insights would be precious, Analysts build models, Hadoop programmers tame the flood of data, and Operations people setup machines and networks. It's exactly the interplay of all participants which is central to project success. 

This setup together with the distributed nature of processing poses new challenges to well-established models of assuring software artifact quality: How can non-programmers define acceptance criteria? How can functionalities be tested which depend on cluster execution, orchestration of, e.g., different Hadoop jobs without delaying the development process? Which data selection is suited best for simulating the live environment? How can intermediate results in arbitrary serialization formats be inspected?

In this talk, experiences and best practices from approaching these problems in a large-scale log data analysis project will be presented. At 1&1, our team develops Hadoop applications which process roughly 1 billion log events (~1 TB) per day. We will give an overview of the hard- and software setup of our quality assurance environment, which includes FitNesse as a wiki-style acceptance testing framework.

	                              right welcome to this first session of                               the bus was very happy to be the one to                               open this very first session                               depends I'm company called units first                               of all have to be sorry to disappoint                               you because in the program it says that                               I do big date applications and I really                               tried hard but i'm not a big dating                               engineer so if you take that to them I'm                                actually sorry i can give you that but i                                will tell you i will tell you a little                                hunting story because i will tell you                                how we're actually hunting a killing                                bugs in our a big tent our projects that                                we did at                                                              something that you all know which is                                adequately fund he says like move like                                no other animal for a big data for                                cricket applications be more like him                                senior this has to build a great                                programs that controls as petabytes of                                data you can skate out with him so                                basically if you have them everybody is                                happy all right everybody's happy but                                then there is something that this is so                                we are all humans if you are recorded                                you know if you like throw comes to                                write box and sometimes it's even more                                bucks and it's a bad thing of course if                                you process petabytes and the numbers                                that come out are just garbage then you                                have real problem right so robust or the                                many bugs in this applications so what                                do we do if we don't want to have bugs                                we have learned a lesson from software                                development we do test-driven                                development right so we want to be able                                to write and execute tests we want to                                specify acceptance criteria and so on so                                this is what you do if you want to build                                software that has no or at least fewer                                bugs all right now let's have a look at                                the big data crowd who can actually                                write tests and what languages do they                                speak so the first guy in this crowd is                                the coder I'm sure you know he's the one                                who knows all the java classes he knows                                how to ride MapReduce code and so on and                                he's yeah into the nitty-gritty details                                of a loop and so on and he we are talked                                his own language he should be able to                                write and execute tests that is not the                                only one we have also have the business                                engineer it doesn't know so much about                                code he knows more about money he knows                                which kpi's are worth how much money                                yeah but he should also be able to write                                tests okay would be cool if you would                                also be able to produce go                                um software right but still it's not the                                only one then we have the data analyst                                so him he's also not so much into code                                but you see he's more like in two models                                into statistics and he knows all the                                models and he also wants to be able to                                write tests and finally we have the                                hardware guy the ops team he runs the                                service he knows how to do everything                                smoothly on the hardware side and now we                                also want to have him in the border                                right and it's a see it's really a mixed                                crowd and whenever builds some kind of                                spaghetti application you will know that                                it's very crucial to a good application                                that they all work together quite well                                okay but this is no bit difficult                                because they're all speak different                                languages they want to be able to write                                tests and we want to report in this talk                                on a tool called fitness which we used                                in a project at one and one at a large                                scale log scale processing the project                                to kind of unify all these languages in                                order to have some nice testable                                development in the big data field and                                finally to hunt them to kill all the                                books of course all right so in the next                                term half now I want to take you on a                                little road to Big Data a QA and those                                are the main steps first of all I will                                tell you a little bit about our big                                Gator problem at one and one and then I                                will tell you about fitness what Fitness                                is how it works and then finally because                                what we do is actually data-driven the                                third part of the talk is about test                                data definition tastes like a selection                                because it's a very important part of                                course as we are in the data driven                                 business in the fourth part i will show                                 you how you can actually start a dupe                                 chops started workflows using fitness                                 and finally and because because the end                                 of the day um you want to inspect                                 results you want to check if what you                                 have done is right i will show you some                                 techniques to do result inspection if                                 it's any question in between just raise                                 your hand don't worry all right so what                                 have you done at this project at them                                 wanted one we have done web intelligence                                 so basically a core part of doing web                                 intelligence is or was in our case um                                 lock mining so we are working on log                                 data from one and from an ad server                                 which the purchase or which                                 produce roughly                                                         per day which is roughly one terabyte of                                 raw data which we process in our Hadoop                                 clusters using several chains of                                 MapReduce jobs running on                                               note has eight cores each node has                                      bytes are from and we're working on the                                 cdh distribution of Hadoop and what we                                 actually produces we do fill a data                                 warehouse with numbers which are the                                 basis for several kinds of BI reporting                                 web analytics and so on so this is                                 basically our setup that you've worked                                 with at one and one I mean so we don't                                 process petabytes but it still is Caleb                                 a tube really already helps you a lot                                 right right so I was telling you that we                                 had first met the two chains and now                                 this is one such a typical chain so we                                 have some kind of input data we have log                                 files in our case those were log files                                 from a net server in the thrift format                                 then we have the first MapReduce job                                 which does produce a first it immediate                                 result then with the second job which                                 again does something with this result                                 and at the end we write the really                                 presence numbers than linear into a data                                 warehouse in our case it was some Oracle                                 and based on this set up by house we                                 have done all those tools like                                 MicroStrategy and so on we can build all                                 those nice reports that you can give to                                 your boss and making pie a lot of money                                 for what you do alright so now what is                                 different or I mean this is our our                                 setting so what were the main challenges                                 for doing test-driven development in                                 such a setup first of all we had to be                                 able to create sample in potatoes when                                 we started to develop this chain the                                 relay server wasn't even online yet so                                 we didn't have real data this is well                                 because and so we we are wanted to be                                 able to in a way create sample log files                                 in order to check if our jobs are doing                                 the right thing right so this is what                                 you really have to be able to do if you                                 want to do this kind of test-driven                                 thing the next thing you have to be able                                 to so you have to be able to inspect                                 binary intermediate results so favor if                                 you've worked with them Hadoop you will                                 know all those strange binary formats in                                 our case                                 we used after all and if you have some                                 kind of food immediate result in the in                                 the in this afro format as its binary                                 you can't just have a look at the file                                 you need some means to check if the                                 content of this file is right okay and                                 the third challenge was to be able to                                 control maybe tues workflow so we had                                 some kind of custom workflow engine at                                 one and one but we also wanted to be                                 able to let's say                                                       to chop so we need some kind of work                                 flow control in the best case integrated                                 into our testing environment right and                                 the fourth challenge is that all those                                 guys should be able to test and you                                 write tests ok so what to do we first                                 had a look at what is out there to do                                 test-driven development will of course                                 because it's finally all java there is j                                 unit as a natural candidate Jeremy tests                                 isolate functions which is ok we also                                 have to have those tests are but there                                 is no kind of integration and of course                                 if you want to write such a test you                                 have to be able to write Java which mr.                                 ah c'mon i'm not sure if he the java pro                                 actually then there is an attention to                                 children called mr unit which tests one                                 meta against one reducer it's already                                 bit more than playing cheering it but                                 it's still little integration and still                                 we have java syntax ok then there's one                                 called I test which is part of the                                 Apache big top project which can be used                                 to test completed OOP chops or two Test                                 complete workflows it's a little bit                                 more but still you have to be able to                                 write Java or groovy in order to write                                 some kind of space test which is ok but                                 still I think miss Ackerman wouldn't be                                 too happy and finally one thing which                                 you can always do is you can write                                 scripts ok used so you can write best                                 scripts to call your chops to you can                                 check on your shell and do do some kind                                 of manual I'm testing this that's not                                 possible but you know we were thinking                                 of some kind of a chaos with all those                                 best scripts and still I mean best in                                 taxes also maybe something mr. Ackerman                                 isn't too familiar with and finally we                                 had to look around and we found                                         call them fitness which we finally found                                 to be suitable                                 and solution for our use case which in a                                 way well fixes and fix some of these                                 with some issues of the other tools                                 right so now that you sum up this first                                 step of the talk one can say that big                                 HIQA is in a way of course different                                 from what you do typically when they do                                 usuals of my development now let's go to                                 the next step and see what's fitness                                 what can you do with fitness and be just                                 one one question could just raise your                                 hand if you've ever written one kind of                                 fitness test who has ever written a                                 fitness test                                                           people so if you look at the website it                                 says that their fitness is a fully                                 integrated standalone wiki an acceptance                                 testing framework this like their the                                 official definition in my eyes I like to                                 see fitness as a wiki where you can run                                 the wiki pages so we have a wiki and on                                 the Vicki if very simple syntax you can                                 write some kind of test and there is a                                 little run or test button on each wiki                                 page and you can run directly in your                                 browser those tests are right now one                                 crucial point about fitness is that this                                 leads to a almost natural language test                                 specification so people don't need to be                                 able to write Java or better or whatever                                 they can almost right kind of test                                 stories and this is exactly what you                                 need in the big data environment because                                 people hopefully speak natural language                                 of basically hopefully everybody speaks                                 natural language and from technical                                 point of view the wiki is then connected                                 to to your system under test via                                 so-called chava fixtures which are just                                 plain old java objects so to give you an                                 overview about fitness like it'sit's                                 basic architecture as i said so what you                                 do is you basically ever have a built-in                                 web server and so you write the test iot                                 within your browser within a very simple                                 syntax which is just a small example i                                 will give you more detail one later so                                 you write this really simple term tax                                 which is almost natural language which i                                 could you please check that the number                                 of results is three then you have the                                 fitness server which translates this                                 page                                 um to Java calls basically in some kind                                 of arbitrary java class which you can                                 write on your own and finally from                                 within this Java class you can access                                 your we were your um system under test                                 finally so so if you want to put it in                                 like the simple words it's like calling                                 java methods i'm from a vicky directly                                 and you can compare what you get back                                 and the nice thing about fitness is is                                 that you cannot only click on this                                 button test in your browser but you can                                 also call those tests from within                                 jenkins there's a complete rest                                 interface this is also very neat if you                                 yeah don't want to click on door your                                 browser I've some but you can't really                                 automate the test then run them nightly                                 and so on so it's really nicely written                                 by think the author is called uncle pop                                 and it really did a great job alright                                 but now to start with a dark example so                                 what does such a fitness test look like                                 so here is a very simple test let's say                                 we want to upload a file to HDFS we want                                 to run a certain a tube top and you want                                 to check if the number of output files                                 is                                                              interfaces you see it all runs in your                                 in your browser and so basically what                                 you do when you write fitness tests is                                 you write tests tables and here is such                                 a test table it's just written or it oh                                 it's best red line by line so it start                                 it starts with the keyword script which                                 tells that there is now coming so some                                 kind of test series actions and we want                                 to have a script which test some kind of                                 a dupe job and then the next line we                                 tell the test to upload a certain file                                 from our local hard drive to the HDFS                                 into a certain remote directory then we                                 start a dupe chop from a particular                                 channel with some input and some output                                 then we show the chop output directly on                                 the wiki side and finally we check if                                 the number of output files is                                            is actually the test story that I told                                 you about so this is no Chavez in flux                                 this is um yeah it's supposed to be in a                                 way that like everybody can write such a                                 test using almost a true language                                 and now one of the most important parts                                 of this interface is across the test                                 button so you can run this test directly                                 by clicking this test button here and if                                 you run this test then the outcome is                                 being displayed directly on the page                                 itself and as you can see line by line                                 the things are are done so first of all                                 the whole table is like and sent shaded                                 then if this line here gets green this                                 means that the upload has been has been                                 done has been has been successful at                                 this line here gets green it means that                                 the job has has run without errors and                                 finally this green marker here tells us                                 that this job actually has produced                                 three output files okay this is of                                 course something that we're yeah when                                 everybody's happy if you press test                                 everything is green then it's all fine                                 and the good thing is if you've written                                 this test once of course you can change                                 your code run the test again and finally                                 be sure but that your changes didn't                                 didn't break anything okay now let's                                 have a look at the source code of this                                 so this is was just playing web                                 interface let's have a look at the                                 source code of this test so we start                                 with the path command this path command                                 um tells fitness where to find those                                 fixture classes which actually connect                                 your test code to your x-ray system                                 under test so we have to do this once                                 you need one shall fall with those                                 fixtures and if to tell fitness where it                                 is okay and then the rest of the the                                 zoomtext is also quite simple you write                                 those tables in this vicky style table                                 syntax i say okay we start this little a                                 dupe script we upload a certain file to                                 the HDFS when we start this chop from a                                 certain shall file we show the output on                                 the website and again we check the                                 number of output file so as you see it's                                 very very simple you don't need to be a                                 real way the code or you don't need to                                 be a real data on a list or whatever                                 it's really thought in a way that                                 everybody can write such a test okay and                                 you can even do copy and paste from from                                 excel if you like there is a little help                                 a method to um we convert excel to this                                 one and if you've ever done Big Data                                 projects I'm sure                                 you will have been asked how can i                                 access this with with axel because                                 excellence of course still a big thing                                 in in many environment alright so this                                 is like the source code of the test                                 itself not it let's have a look at an                                 excerpt of the Java fixture class which                                 lies underneath this test so it's as I                                 said it's just a plain old java class so                                 it's such a class which is called a dupe                                 as you say you have to mention this                                 class name when you after this is in the                                 first line after this damn script check                                 and then the point about writing                                 fixtures is is that you um i do right                                 methods and you can in a way call these                                 methods from the wiki site itself so you                                 see this method upload to HDFS which                                 takes a local file and remote file as                                 some arguments and if we go back                                 remember upload to HDFS so in this line                                 you basically call this method so method                                 upload to HDFS is then called with these                                 two arguments now not the point is if                                 you are a coder this is actually this                                 will actually be horrible for you                                 because here you mix method names and                                 arguments this is what fitness does                                 internally but this is by my intention                                 because this leads to in a way more                                 natural tester test stories in a way so                                 so maybe miss Ackerman would actually                                 stand behind you when you write a test                                 and he will tell you could you please                                 upload this file to the HDFS at this                                 destination and this is actually what                                 what witness does um by and were                                 interpreting or splitting those method                                 names right and the rest of the method                                 calls is similar just have and you can                                 just start some kind of a new job you                                 can get the chop output and you can                                 check the number of output files and                                 then within those methods you can                                 actually do whatever you want to call a                                 dupe chops you can access the Java                                 interface                                                             have like the full Java control to                                 connect to your to your system under                                 test                                 alright so to sum up this second step of                                 our road what we did is we did actually                                 fitness Vicki test execution and he have                                 really had it some kind of good results                                 because everybody can now write tests                                 even right now at the                                                   business engineers writing tests in this                                 very simple syntax right so as I said                                 because we're finally in the data drink                                 business it's very important to have                                 good test data because the quality of                                 the test data finally determines the                                 quality of the test so how can we                                 actually define test data how can you                                 write a test data so this is basically a                                 a wiki page from from fitness which has                                 create a plain text CSV file this is                                 it's not rocket science you just have                                 this symbol here that we start a table                                 which just produce a log file we specify                                 where to store the log file and the rest                                 of this wiki page is just just the plain                                 raw data which is then being written                                 into into this for this log file which                                 is later the basis for the test which                                 you're running right and so again the                                 chin tucked underneath is quite simple                                 everybody should be able to in a way                                 define these files and once again you                                 can copy and paste from from excellent                                 so we have a very simple way to define                                 small and very controlled log files                                 alright so far about plain text but in                                 all case the input data was in plain                                 text it's actually often the case that                                 when you do some kind of big data                                 application development a very crucial                                 point is and that gives a very efficient                                 and fast data transfer among                                 heterogeneous sources and one technique                                 to do this is thrift so when used riff                                 to define an interface we had interface                                 definition language and give you then                                 take this IDL file into compile it into                                 different interface class for example                                 for java for c++ and so on and so what                                 you will but and so and so what you will                                 do when                                 want to define the plaintext log file                                 but a surf block file so this is our                                 terrific blog file fixture that we have                                 written so we just start again and say                                 now we don't want to do a like normal                                 log file but you want to create a thrift                                 clock by right again we say where to                                 store it and then as the second argument                                 we give the name of the java class which                                 has been compiled from the ideal and the                                 rest of this table is actually almost                                 identical to the slide before so here no                                 basically you can write your a test                                 italian and the outcome is a log file in                                 the thrift format i will say well this                                 doesn't really look different from this                                 table here this is actually by intention                                 because this allows us to write log data                                 basically transparently from the web                                 format so from a test of the point of                                 view he will doesn't care if you just                                 produce CSV data or thrift or whatever                                 you need you just have to change the                                 header right and this is very it's very                                 nice feature because when you change                                 your your local input for example you                                 just have to change a fixture which                                 writes the log files ok all right now                                 you may ask ok you can define some data                                 on a wiki page with                                                   maybe                                                            thousand lines it really will really                                 yeah need some people to do this for you                                 so of course you also want to test with                                 some kind of real data with with a snap                                 shots all parts of your life data a                                 first project message to do this in our                                 environment was that we have been                                 choosing the same hardware for the test                                 and for the different vironment that we                                 had in prod so sorry we didn't have like                                                                                                      machines from life and put them in our                                 test environment no test cluster this                                 was the first thing that we did and then                                 we did some kind of random or by                                 assembling the terms of example we were                                 running the tests in the test                                 environment with a latest episode say                                 for one hour or of one day and by doing                                 so our goal was to create some kind of                                 feedback loop so when you to actually                                 find tested a manual                                 it's very hard to find out all those                                 special cases that actually break things                                 at the end or right and so then we just                                 took these parts of the live data and we                                 found out all those very special strange                                 cases and we added those cases to the                                 manual data definition and by doing so                                 we're actually increasing gradually our                                 our test coverage so it's a kind of it's                                 a it's a loop just you do some kind of                                 test data manually then you do some                                 thing with a with them put part of a                                 live data and basically you just getting                                 better each with each run naturally                                 right so to sum up this third part one                                 can say that what we did is we did we                                 can define we using fitness you can                                 define CSV thrift or real world test                                 data as the basis for the actual chops                                 and for the actual test runs all right                                 so far about the data but finally we                                 want to run a dupe shop so how do we do                                 this with with fitness the first way to                                 do it always call it the like Swiss Army                                 knife so what there is something called                                 a shell fixture I'm this shell fixture                                 enables you to write any kind of                                 arbitrary bash command into this wiki                                 site you as you see here what you do                                 actually here is you you're basically                                 calling the loop binary the dupe command                                 and you first upload a file to HDFS and                                 then you run some kind of a tube top all                                 right so this is the first thing that                                 you can do so you can basically miss you                                 so you can use fitness as a as an                                 alternative pêche in the face we can                                 just write any kind of patch commands                                 directly on your only fitness site okay                                 so this works but again let mr. come on                                 would have to be able to write back so                                 it's yeah not the optimal but you can                                 execute arbitrary shell commands and the                                 point is we didn't write a little code                                 for this fixture this fixture is made it                                 just a wrapper around the picture                                 comments exit command line so we just                                 pass on those commands to an existing                                 library alt bicep this is                                 not the nicest way then we wrote a                                 Hadoop fixture as i said this fixture is                                 a thought or its intended I'm to enable                                 like really everybody through start and                                 stop a tube runs and so on and so I've                                 already seen this picture I've shown you                                 before as I said we start again with                                 this command script which tells us right                                 now we start a series of a dupe testing                                 actions and the rest of this test is                                 that you've already seen before it's                                 supposed to be written like a like a                                 test story so we said we upload this                                 file to the HDFS we start the job we                                 show the output and we finally check if                                 the number of output files is three so                                 the idea so now we don't have to know                                 for example how to deal with the Hadoop                                 shell command this is basically hidden                                 from you as a test author and this is                                 kind of the point about those fixtures                                 you hide complexity from the test office                                 so when you write such a fixture class                                 by choosing the right method names you                                 can no way define a good language via                                 those java method names so you can just                                 in a way yeah you can listen to say miss                                 Ackerman see what you would say if you                                 want to start some kind of job and then                                 just name the method accordingly and                                 then you have his language and of course                                 internally you can reduce other fixtures                                 because I'm example when you start this                                 a tube job internally we reuse where I'm                                 there I'm shell fixture but now this a                                 very crucial point because this is the                                 kind of cope or like one of the core                                 points what fitness that you can really                                 define your own test language which                                 really fits the needs of all big data                                 application development participants                                 alright but then we also want you to be                                 able to UM but only run a test with one                                 Medusa but with chains now there is one                                 thing which is also common in the in the                                 test environment that Fitness also has                                 sweet so you can group tests into sweets                                 and those sweets exactly what we used to                                 anyway simulate our MapReduce processing                                 chains so we did have some kind of                                 workflow engine at                                                       those chops but them we really want you                                 to be able for example if you have a                                 chain with let's say                                                   and you run this whole chain and the                                 first nine are doing well and the last                                 one fails you don't want to run the                                 first nine tests again if you want to                                 test the telephone okay and so this is                                 why we use this some anyway sweet                                 approach and another good thing about                                 this some sweet approaches that you can                                 also add some kind of setup suite which                                 for example downloads the latest                                 artifact from your memory repository                                 deploys your artifact cleans the                                 database and so on and you have a kid                                 own suite which cleans up the whole mess                                 that you have created during testing but                                 of course still you can run the tests                                 individually right and so this was                                 actually it's a very simple building                                 fixture but it really did the job of our                                 chopped and workflow control in our case                                 alright so to some of this fourth part                                 one could say that in our project we                                 used sweets and fixtures to run into                                 control chops and workflows and now                                 finally the last thing that you want do                                 you want to check if what you have done                                 is right so we need to be able to                                 inspect the result so how can you do                                 this with some fitness now there is one                                 thing which comes along with fitness um                                 which are called which is called query                                 tables so now let's start from the very                                 end of the processing chain so we do all                                 those a dupe chose might be two stops                                 and at the end we write some really                                 precious KPI in our data warehouse and                                 you want to check in this data warehouse                                 if the number is right and with this                                 creditable you can basically execute any                                 SQL                                 command against any database which you                                 can access via by jdbc and in the next                                 lines you basically write what you would                                 expect so what happens now internally is                                 then this this I'm query is being sent                                 to the database the result is being is                                 being sent back and it is compared                                 against but you're right here and if the                                 result is the same all the numbers are                                 green and if there is one number which                                 is different it is being read so this                                 busy well particular what you do if you                                 want to check for example you're very                                 final kpi's which you right into your                                 data warehouse but now when you have                                 worked with wife you will know that that                                 life in combination with the hive server                                 also allows a nexus via by jdbc and you                                 can also use this and anyway set up                                 fitness tutorial click very life and                                 this also there nice thing because then                                 you can't only query your data warehouse                                 with naughty be nice but you can also                                 give a query your raw data by writing                                 those five carries directly on your own                                 your fitness page right so this is what                                 I'm fitness offers you to innovate query                                 those those variables what price I said                                 one other thing that is very um order                                 that it was very special about our chops                                 is that we have all those strange binary                                 intermediate format so for example if                                 you write in immediate formats results                                 in the way afro format and for this                                 purpose we wrote a big fixture so you                                 can now it so again you start and you                                 say right now on this page I want to                                 execute pic commands you start a pic                                 console with um with um some parameters                                 you want to reproduce here is the char                                 which holds your fixtures you have some                                 other arguments and then we want to load                                 a certain of a file from HDFS into a                                 certain alias and then what you can do                                 in the next lines you can add I guess                                 many lines as you like and each line is                                 one statement of piglet in so                                 basically at pig latin directly to your                                 fitness page and do some kind of                                 processing here we first filter                                    column and we then again filter the                                 values of this column and finally we                                 check if we have actually                                               our result so yeah and this is so                                 there's an all you can basically write                                 any kind of pic comment directly on your                                 fitness page of course miss Ackerman                                 trust not necessarily speak pig but                                 maybe one of those guys who does write                                 tests does um doesn't speak pick em and                                 the next thing is that you can also in a                                 way add some kind of special java method                                 names which kind of are being translated                                 internally to pick commands and this is                                 what i will like to show you on the next                                 slide so this is like a snippet of the                                 source code of this pig console that i                                 was calling right here and the first                                 thing you should notice is that this big                                 console does extend the pic server so if                                 you've ever done something with pig you                                 will know this class it's the internal                                 main entry point for doing pick berries                                 and so by extending the pig server or by                                 this very simple extent what we get is                                 we can call each method from the pic                                 server directly from our fix right so we                                 could so basically what we do is you can                                 reuse existing libraries java classes                                 and so on and use them as a fixture                                 because basically every java class is a                                 fixture and so by doing the simple                                 extent we can reuse all the methods from                                 the pic server and on top we can add                                 this yeah in a way nice layer of test                                 language so by adding this method load a                                 profile using aliens um we you can now                                 write on your fitness page please load                                 this afro file into the aliens which is                                 kind of actual language and internally                                 we translate this call to a pig latin                                 statement                                 and so this is no something that but                                 also miss Ackerman could do because he                                 would or he might stand behind you in                                 the test and tell you could you please                                 load this a profile into a certain                                 audience ok and internally you can                                 translate it I to pick and I mean first                                 you can in a way it's a force would not                                 be a good idea to the way we invent pick                                 or to paraphrase pick but you can add                                 method names which hide the pic                                 complexity all right enough finally the                                 last thing or the last experience that                                 we made at in your project is that you                                 don't want it you don't want to inspect                                 the results only attend the only in a                                 testing environment but you also want to                                 be able to run your tests within                                 different environments so I doubt                                 project and we had the Deaf environment                                 very testing environment and gradual                                 life environment and so what you could                                 do is you could set up one fitness                                 server in like each environment write                                 the tests there and run them that but we                                 didn't want to observe this we wanted to                                 have all tests at one like central place                                 and so what we did is we had one like                                 fitness master where all the tests for                                 all projects go in right and so like in                                 this Fitness master we have one kind of                                 sub structure where we have one area for                                 each project and then what we do is in                                 each of our environments so here we have                                 the Deaf environments if we have the                                 testing environment will finally we have                                 the life Armand we set up a client it's                                 it's just another Fitness server which                                 basically import the tests from a                                 central server the reserve building                                 mechanism from fitness which allows you                                 to do this and then you can basically                                 import although Ted all those tests and                                 run them like the same tests in let                                 different environments but now of course                                 if you run the tests in a different                                 model mundt you want to access the Deaf                                 database if you run them in the testing                                 environment you want to access their the                                 testing database you need some                                 configuration and now we also start the                                 configuration in the central server so                                 for each project we store one config                                 for following each environment and again                                 we import this config and so finally                                 what we have is we have for each of our                                 of with each of our environments we have                                 like a like a thin client which is just                                 a plain fitness server which imports the                                 test from the simple server and is being                                 configured also from the central server                                 and so it's very easy and to add for                                 example new environment so when we left                                 one and one they were thinking about                                 adding some kind of pre life environment                                 so we could serve this very easily but I                                 think just one more fitness server and                                 just adding one more conflict and so we                                 can basically have scale in all                                 dimensions of this test matrix right so                                 far about the story again those are the                                 main steps of the talk in this basically                                 like the whole story we first saw that                                 we get a gray is different we saw that                                 Fitness is a good addition for our use                                 case i can define test data we can run                                 chops and we can inspect the results                                 with pic and type but finally the most                                 important thing that we did you finally                                 realized in your project this was that                                 now everybody is actually happy and this                                 s innovex of course is our is our                                 motivation to make our customers happy                                 finally and them I have to add one                                 little advertisement section if you want                                 to know more about all the stuff also                                 for various trainings and finally I'm                                 not the only in abit scar here if you                                 meet if you happen to see one of those

stuff that I was                                 just talking about and thank you for                                 questions                                 you                                 you
