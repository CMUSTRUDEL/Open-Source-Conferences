Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2013: Ariel Waldman - Keynote: The Hacker's Guide to the Galaxy #bbuzz
Publication date: 2013-06-19
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2013 #bbuzz
Description: 
	Don't panic: the next big science revolution isn't just for asteroid miners or CERN scientists. Just as science fiction has often shown the way to future inventions, the act of hacking is now generating prototypes that act as footholds for future explorations, discoveries and epiphanies in science. 

This presentation takes you on a tour of our universe (from black holes and dark matter to exoplanets and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence) and shows you how you can actively explore the final frontier through getting excited and making things.

	                              okay uh so forgive me if I pick up here                               a bit jet-lagged I got him the other day                               and I'm really excited to be back in                               Berlin it's a not sure might be my fifth                               time here or so so I really love it here                               so I wanted to talk to you all today                               about the hackers guide to the galaxy                               and I essentially wanted to start with                               this image here if you can make it out                                it's the name is I've recently really                                fallen in love with and we just love it                                so much because it's sort of this                                nebulous a kind of almost chaotic                                looking place and it looks like it's                                very far out in outer space but what                                you're actually looking at is an image                                of our own Milky Way galaxy and I find                                it interesting because this is one of                                the first images of our Milky Way galaxy                                where we're able to actually really see                                what it looks like for the first time                                this image I think was compiled in                                     and typically when we think about our                                Milky Way galaxy we think of something                                more like this something that's more                                kind of a quaint spiral structure                                something that's uh you know that this                                kind of system so to speak but in                                reality our galaxy looks something more                                like this and we just haven't really                                been able to see it until recently                                because often when we try and look at                                our own galaxy there's so much space                                dust and space gas in a way that we                                haven't really been able to see it so                                this image was compiled in                                            to a space telescope called the Spitzer                                Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space                                Telescope is this great telescope that                                uses infrared so it's able to peer past                                all the space dust and space gas and is                                able to actually get this lovely image                                of our galaxy that I was just showing                                and the Spitzer Space Telescope gets                                these images of our galaxy very much                                from the viewpoint of Earth and this is                                because it's on the same orbit as Earth                                orbits around the Sun and kind of trails                                behind the earth and takes these                                gorgeous images so here's just a few                                more images from the Spitzer Space                                Telescope again of the center of our                                galaxy and what it really looks like                                that you know you no longer see these                                spiral structures but you're able to                                actually really see kind of the beauty                                of our own galaxy in a sense                                so I'm Ariel Waldman I live about                                       light-years away from all of that those                                images are very much at the center of                                our galaxy and earth is about                                       light-years away from all that and I                                find it really interesting to think                                about sort of the history of what it is                                that we know about our own galaxy and                                about our own universe this is a                                fascinating image this was an early sort                                of depiction of what are what the shape                                of our own galaxy was made in                                        William Herschel what he did is he used                                all these star observations that he had                                made to sort of roughly map out what the                                shape of our own galaxy looks like and                                it's a bit hard to see but if you see                                sort of a little bold star in the middle                                that's where he thought earth was which                                we now know is a bit off we're not at                                the center home galaxy thankfully                                because it's a fairly terminal a kind of                                crazy place to be in the center so we                                now know where                                                        from the center but i thought this image                                was actually really fascinating                                nevertheless more fascinating i think is                                the fact that we actually it hasn't even                                been a hundred years since we even knew                                that there was anything more to the                                universe than our own galaxy a hundred                                years ago we thought the Milky Way                                galaxy was the entire universe that                                there were no other galaxies in the                                universe whatsoever so it wasn't                                actually until                                                       that you can see here actually it's not                                a lot of time looking at a blob out in                                the out in the middle of space to                                determine is there actually more than                                just the Milky Way galaxy in our own                                universe this blob is essentially what                                 he spent so much time looking at at the                                 time this was referred to as the                                 Andromeda nebula so at the time we                                 thought maybe there's some nebula maybe                                 there's some junk but it's kind of like                                 at the edge of our own galaxy but pretty                                 much the universe is only the Milky Way                                 galaxy he spent a lot of time looking at                                 this in the                                                       determine actually it's not the                                 Andromeda nebula is Andromeda galaxy and                                 so he was able to determine that there's                                 actually more than just our galaxy in                                 the universe of course now we know                                 there's billions and billions of                                 galaxies so it's just kind of                                 mind-boggling that it's been less than a                                 hundred years that we even knew how                                 large our universe could actually                                 potentially be also interesting because                                 the first known depiction of the                                 Andromeda galaxy was made in the year                                                                                                     Persian astronomer and there's a person                                 and a fish these were sort of Persian                                 and Arabic constellations but if you can                                 see at the mouth of the fish there's                                 this tiny little cloud that's actually                                 the first known depiction of them drama                                 two galaxies so it took about a thousand                                 years for us to figure out what this                                 blob was that was its own galaxy and                                 that there were actually many many                                 galaxies in our own universe I also find                                 it interesting because as many of you                                 here will know mac OS x famously shipped                                 with the andromeda galaxy as its desktop                                 paper so it's actually something that a                                 lot of us as nerds have also spent a lot                                 of time looking at as well so to me when                                 I look at these images of our own galaxy                                 and kind of what it actually looks like                                 it reminds me of kind of how little it                                 is we know about our own galaxy and                                 about our own universe and I really like                                 studying things that are really on the                                 verge of what we know and what we don't                                 know one of those sort of unknowns of                                 our universe that we're still trying to                                 wrap our heads around our black holes                                 and black holes are things that                                 typically get a fairly bad reputation                                 they're known as these incredibly dense                                 places in space-time that sort of pull                                 in everything around them pull in stars                                 pulling planets they're known for                                 gobbling things up never to be seen                                 again and while that's kind of true                                 they're also now known as doing sort of                                 the opposite while these black holes                                 gobble up everything around them they                                 oftentimes gobble up more than they can                                 chew and when they gobble up more than                                 they can chew they vomit it back out                                 into the universe quite violently and                                 all this space                                 space gasps that these black holes vomit                                 back out into the universe actually                                 might go on to create stars and solar                                 systems and potentially even galaxies so                                 these black holes well they're known to                                 be very fairly destructive and chaotic                                 forces forces of nature they're also                                 kind of these creative forces of nature                                 they actually help create things as well                                 and so at the center of our own galaxy                                 there's a supermassive black hole and                                 this is a sort of idea that most people                                 have become familiar with that most                                 galaxies at their Center have a                                 supermassive black hole but what I find                                 also interesting is that in our galaxy                                 alone there are as many as a hundred                                 million black holes hundred million of                                 them floating around our galaxy a lot of                                 them are fairly small there may be only                                 two miles in diameter or so but there's                                 still incredibly powerful forces of                                 nature and so while you can't image a                                 black hole because even light itself                                 can't escape from its pull you can image                                 a black holes vomit so what you're                                 actually looking at here inside that                                 circle is black hole varmit which is                                 quite delightful this is the galaxy m                                   not the band at my                                                       yeah inside that circle is a black hole                                 vomit so this is an even better image of                                 that process taking place sort of this                                 black holes kind of gobbling up                                 everything around it and then vomiting                                 it back out into the universe to go on                                 and create things and so they sort of                                 sample everything around them mash it up                                 and then spit it back out into the                                 universe to go on to create bigger and                                 better things so to me when I think of                                 black holes and why I'm so fascinated                                 with them is because black holes to me                                 are kind of these supermassive hackers                                 of the universe they're been essentially                                 these forces of nature that sort of                                 sample everything around them mash it up                                 and then create derivative works that                                 then they send back out into the                                 universe that might go on to create                                 bigger and better things and it's really                                 about this idea of creating sparks for                                 future things not really knowing where                                 they're going I guess fascinates me so                                 much about space exploration and black                                 holes and it was sort of a                                 spark in a sense that led me to where I                                 am today which is working in space                                 exploration and prior to                                               do anything related to space exploration                                 whatsoever in                                                          great documentary on the Discovery                                 Channel called when we left Earth it was                                 this great documentary about the Apollo                                 program and NASA figuring out how to do                                 space exploration in the                                                 and I found it to be so incredibly                                 inspiring and I think one of the reasons                                 why I found it to be so inspiring was                                 not because it was a was a bunch of                                 rocket scientist but in a sense these                                 were all actually space hackers in a lot                                 of the people at NASA didn't know                                 anything about space exploration in the                                 early days the average age at NASA in                                 the                                                                  they were very much figuring out how to                                 explore space and they just didn't know                                 a lot just yet and so when I was                                 watching this documentary I just was                                 incredibly inspired and I said to myself                                 I don't know anything about space                                 exploration I want to work at NASA and                                 and so I decided to randomly send                                 someone at NASA an email saying that I                                 was a huge fan of what they were doing                                 and if they ever needed someone like me                                 who didn't have any formal science                                 background whatsoever that I was here                                 serendipitously I was able to get a job                                 at NASA from that email and it                                 completely changed my life so this is an                                 image of me at NASA I look fairly calm                                 but I was actually freaking out because                                 it was just so inspiring to be there so                                 I wanted to actually share with all of                                 you a clip from this documentary that I                                 found to be so inspiring to beat the                                 Soviets NASA must launch a man into                                 Earth orbit only Rockets can go fast                                 enough we knew nothing about rocketry to                                 renew that I think                                 about spacecraft I knew nothing about                                 orbits Oh cell model rockets launched                                 I'd say that somewhere between thirty                                 and forty percent of them failed                                 a lot of them came up off the pad and                                 went the opposite direction some of them                                 got halfway off the pad and blew up some                                 of them got to                                                          other way and blew up the whole thing                                 crumbled and blew up it looked like an                                 atomic bomb went off almost over our                                 heads we've got a big kick out of                                 watching the mercury astronauts was                                 great looking at their eyes                                 we're looking at this thing looking at                                 each other and deciding we want to go                                 back and talk to the engineers a little                                 more before go further so this is what I                                 love so much actually reminds me of this                                 image here but you know you have this                                 idea that exploring space is all about                                 rocket scientists and actually it was a                                 bunch of people kind of like us who were                                 figuring out how to explore space and                                 that's what I found to be so amazing                                 learning about the early days of NASA                                 and I think this is something we've kind                                 of forgotten we do kind of view these                                 people as rocket scientists as people                                 who know exactly what they're doing but                                 the reality is is that a lot of the                                 heroes of science over the time have                                 been considered amateurs Charles Darwin                                 was primarily self-funded and Thomas                                 Edison was primarily uneducated he was                                 home-schooled and a lot of the                                 experiments that he did were during his                                 night job when he got bored so                                 thankfully we still have a lot of                                 amateurs who are running around doing                                 science still today one of which I find                                 really interesting is SpaceX who's a                                 well-known space exploration company in                                 the United States by elon musk and Elon                                 Musk who co-founded paypal k mouths                                 paypal and he said you know he wanted to                                 build a space exploration company he                                 wanted to build rockets that would                                 hopefully one day take people into space                                 and so he poured all of his money and                                 all this time into building a rocket and                                 he built this rocket and he sent it up                                 and it completely failed it was a                                 complete failure um and so you know he                                 didn't want to let that get him down and                                 so he poured a lot more money and a lot                                 more time into second rocket and that                                 also completely failed complete failure                                 and so third time's the charm he spent a                                 lot of time doing a third rocket launch                                 sent that up that also completely failed                                 it wasn't actually until his fourth                                 rocket launch that he even had a                                 successful rocket launch at all                                 and so a lot of people find SpaceX to be                                 interesting because of how successful                                 they are I actually find them to be                                 interesting because of their failures                                 and because it's proof that still today                                 people are figuring out how to do space                                 exploration that no one's really this                                 so-called rocket scientist that knows                                 everything and so to me what I really                                 love about all of this in space                                 exploration is really the exploration of                                 the unknown and this is something that                                 space exploration definitely does and                                 this is something that science fiction                                 has been really good at science fiction                                 has been great at kind of creating                                 concepts for future things before anyone                                 really knows much about them arthur c                                 clarke famously wrote about satellites                                 before they existed and science fiction                                 in general just is great at this but i                                 think it's now time for hacking to kind                                 of be the new science fiction in a sense                                 in the way that you can sort of hack                                 together new concepts before they                                 actually exist and sort of explore the                                 unknown through hacking rather than just                                 some science fiction now and so born out                                 of this love of exploring the unknown                                 came an event called science hack day                                 and science hack day is a                                               in which scientists designers developers                                 and all different types of people come                                 together in the same physical space to                                 see what they can rapidly prototype with                                 science in                                                               is an image from the event in San                                 Francisco it's just an amazing event                                 it's really just around getting excited                                 and making things with science you can                                 build something still silly you can                                 build something serious doesn't really                                 matter it's just about you know kind of                                 messing around and making making stuff                                 and having fun and experimenting and                                 hackathons as you all know have become                                 something that's fairly ubiquitous                                 something that happens all the time and                                 while a lot of them are great some of                                 the hackathons are happening around the                                 world today look something more like                                 this to me a lot of hackathons have                                 become more commercial and they do focus                                 a lot on the output on the startups that                                 come out of them on the products that                                 come out of them and while that's all                                 great it kind of looks like an assembly                                 line                                 to me it kind of misses the point of                                 what's so great about hacking it's                                 really just around playing around it's                                 really just about playing around and                                 experimenting with things and not really                                 caring where it goes and I think that's                                 something that a lot of hackathons have                                 sort of missed the point of it's really                                 just around playing and not having any                                 idea of what you're doing necessarily                                 and just having fun and so it reminds me                                 of this quote that at the heart of                                 anything good there should be a kernel                                 of something undefinable and if you can                                 define it or claim to be able to define                                 it then in a sense you've missed the                                 point so it's really just around all                                 this undefinable unknown stuff in a                                 sense so some of the almost undefinable                                 and unknown weird things I've come out                                 science hack days have been things like                                 this this is essentially what you're                                 looking at is a typeface that someone                                 wanted to create in which all of the                                 letters of the typeface would have equal                                 wind drag so what you're actually                                 looking at here is a makeshift wind                                 tunnel and someone actually recorded the                                 wind drag of each individual letter and                                 then weighted each individual letter so                                 that all the letters had equal wind drag                                 so if you need a typeface in which all                                 of the letters have equal wind drag it                                 looks something like this I have no idea                                 what this is good for how it's going to                                 change the world or what it means but                                 this was a physicist who was playing                                 with typography at a science hack day so                                 it was kind of I thought it was kind of                                 awesome another example is this hack                                 which was called the DIA knackery                                 essentially this was a cocktail of                                 extracted strawberry DNA extracting DNA                                 is something that you can do fairly                                 simply with some household sort of                                 materials but sometimes it requires                                 materials that are edible so someone                                 wanted to make a cocktail of completely                                 edible materials that would have                                 extracted strawberry DNA in it so what                                 you're actually seeing here is the long                                 polymers of DNA clumping together as                                 they're extracting the DNA in this                                 cocktail this recipe is up on                                 instructables in case you want to try it                                 but I                                 warn you it tastes disgusting is not                                 good at all um but you can try it if you                                 want to impress your friends this was a                                 hack that I concept it and had a friend                                 helped me build this was a concept for a                                 lamp that would light up every time an                                 asteroid passed by the earth so you had                                 sort of a near-death lamp so to speak so                                 asteroids passed by the earth fairly                                 often and so this light would alert you                                 and you could like dive under your desk                                 and freak out all of your co-workers or                                 something um it was a fun idea I pretty                                 sure we can probably figure out how to                                 hack this together over this week um not                                 shipping it just yet but maybe one day                                 another cool hack made by people were at                                 a science hack day was a group of                                 hackers wanted to simulate what it was                                 like to experience synesthesia and                                 synesthesia is essentially something                                 where the wires between your different                                 senses get crossed so some people with                                 synesthesia will report associating                                 colors with certain letters or if they                                 hear a loud sound they might actually                                 see a ripple across their vision there's                                 actually a bunch of different types of                                 synesthesia so this group of hackers                                 wanted to simulate what it was like to                                 experience this and so they created a                                 really really creepy hack called                                 synesthesia this is actually a mask that                                 simulates synesthesia really creepy mask                                 at that and how they built this is                                 essentially they took a bunch of                                 vibrating speakers and they attached it                                 to someone's face and they attached all                                 these vibrating speakers to someone's                                 face and because it was a hack day and                                 they only had                                                          this supposedly the only open pattern                                 for the for a mask that they could find                                 was one for a mask which is kind of                                 adds the creepy factor to it so they                                 stayed up all night so together this                                 mask sewed in all the vibrating speakers                                 and then they wired it all up to an                                 Arduino and a webcam so as you navigate                                 different parts of a room and different                                 parts of the room or a lighter or darker                                 different parts of your face start                                 vibrating                                 so in this sense you can begin to feel                                 site in a weird way so I thought this                                 was amazing actually I woke up to it the                                 next morning at the science hack day and                                 it was a very creeped out by it um but I                                 really like all these hacks that really                                 explore the idea of what's visible and                                 what's invisible this is because                                 ninety-five percent of everything in our                                 entire universe is invisible and when I                                 say ninety-five percent absolutely                                 everything is invisible it really is                                 absolutely everything this is a pie                                 chart of the entire energy and matter of                                 our universe and as you can see                                 seventy-four percent is dark energy                                 about twenty two percent is dark matter                                 and the rest less than five percent is                                 everything visible in our universe in                                 fact if you take out intergalactic gas                                 less than half of a percent is actually                                 everything visible in our universe so                                 this is every planet you could ever see                                 every star you could ever see everything                                 you could ever see with the exception of                                 intergalactic gas makes up less than                                 half of a percent of the universe so we                                 are very much the etc in the universe in                                 a sense but all the invisible stuff is                                 really fascinating to me to sort of look                                 at dark matter is essentially the stuff                                 where when we look into galaxies and we                                 see that they're held together there's                                 not actually enough mass to account for                                 enough gravity to explain how these                                 galaxies are all held together so we                                 give this sort of invisible mass a                                 placeholder name of dark matter dark                                 matter is essentially this stuff that                                 globs around galaxies it's not uniform                                 there's actually these globs of dark                                 matter around galaxies and we think that                                 maybe it's some weakly interacting                                 particles that sort of help pull us all                                 together and push us closer and closer                                 and help keep us all together so to me                                 in a lot of ways this is a very friendly                                 universe we have a we've all these                                 weakly interacting particles are helping                                 keep us close and keep us all together                                 but there's also an opposite side to the                                 universe thats dark energy when we look                                 into the universe and we see                                 expanding we actually see that as                                 expanding much faster than we think it                                 should be and so this gives gets the                                 placeholder name of dark energy and it's                                 actually pushing galaxies further and                                 further apart from one another so                                 ninety-five percent of everything is                                 invisible but despite this we still have                                 an optical overdose problem in our                                 culture we often think that if you need                                 more information we'll simply just give                                 you more screens until it looks                                 something like this this isn't a picture                                 from a movie this is actually a picture                                 from the Large Hadron Collider the                                 particle accelerator at CERN and                                 particle accelerators do deal with a lot                                 of information there are essentially                                 these massive space-time smashers that                                 take subatomic particles and collide                                 them into other subatomic particles at                                 very high speeds and when these                                 subatomic particles collide for a moment                                 they turn into energy and then they turn                                 back into subatomic particles the                                 difference being is that when they turn                                 back into subatomic particles sometimes                                 they turn into really weird ones ones                                 that you might only see in the beginning                                 of the Big Bang or in a supernova very                                 far out in space so these massive                                 space-time smashers are essentially                                 creating the conditions of the big bang                                 and of different events in outer space                                 here on earth which is pretty amazing                                 they are also though just very expensive                                 machines for scientists to take pretty                                 pictures with these pictures look                                 something like this I'm not a particle                                 physicist I can't begin to explain                                 everything in this image but I've been                                 told that the four green lines and the                                 four red towers represent for                                 high-energy electrons and so these are a                                 lot of the visualizations of these                                 subatomic particle collisions that                                 scientists will look at but a group at a                                 science hack day wanted to sort of play                                 around with what if instead of seeing                                 what a subatomic particle collision                                 looks like what if you could actually                                 hear what one sounds like so a group                                 created a really cool hat called the                                 particle wind chime and essentially took                                 this subatomic particle collision data                                 and mapped it                                 sounds so if you could imagine what a                                 particle collision might sound like                                 that's what they were actually able to                                 create the cool thing about this was not                                 only did you have this sort of symphony                                 of subatomic particle collisions playing                                 but it's also now being looked at is                                 sort of a augmented diagnostic tool for                                 particle accelerator laboratories and                                 this is because if you can imagine being                                 at CERN at the Large Hadron Collider                                 which would be really cool but if you                                 can imagine being there surrounded by                                 tons of screens and all these screens                                 are telling you how the accelerator is                                 doing but in addition to that you could                                 get used to how the accelerator sounds                                 you could get used to is something                                 sounds a bit off that's what the                                 particle windchime is now being looked                                 into as so it's kind of a cool                                 application of it but despite being the                                 etc in the universe us as all these                                 visible sort of particles of the                                 universe there's actually a lot of                                 interesting things to also do in the                                 visible spectrum one of which is to                                 actually search for extraterrestrials                                 the SETI Institute which is the search                                 for extraterrestrial intelligence                                 Institute has you know historically                                 looked at radio waves as a way of                                 detecting intelligent civilizations                                 thinking that an intelligent                                 civilization might be able to create a                                 radio transmitter of source and so                                 that's how we would maybe detect them                                 and while they're still looking at radio                                 waves there are now actually turning                                 their sites to site there now actually                                 wanting to look into the universe for                                 pulses of light pulses of light that                                 could only exist by an intelligent                                 civilization creating it so not things                                 created by nature but but pulses of                                 light that would be very specific to an                                 intelligent civilization so it's kind of                                 a cool way of actually thinking about                                 detecting extraterrestrial intelligence                                 if we if we can using site instead of                                 just radio waves another cool way that                                 we're search that we're using visit the                                 visible spectrum is through searching                                 for exoplanets an exoplanets just stands                                 for extrasolar planets or planets around                                 other stars and we've discovered                                 hundreds and hundreds of the                                 use exoplanets so far but in our galaxy                                 alone there's around                                                   so there's a lot left to be discovered                                 but the way exoplanets have been                                 discovered lately has been through                                 NASA's Kepler telescope and what NASA's                                 Kepler telescope does is it essentially                                 looks at starlight very very closely it                                 pays such close attention to this                                 starlight that it can detect any small                                 dips in brightness in it and if it                                 detects a small dip in brightness in                                 starlight what it might actually be                                 witnessing is an exoplanet passing in                                 front of its star and so if an                                 earth-sized planet passes in front of a                                 star but brightness might only dip down                                 by one ten-thousandth or so a very small                                 amount but this telescope can detect                                 that dip in brightness and can tell us                                 if we're looking at an exoplanet or not                                 which is which is pretty cool and so                                 nASA has a bunch of machines and                                 algorithms to sort of automatically tell                                 us if we're looking at an exoplanet or                                 not and while that's great and it has                                 discovered a lot of planets humans are                                 still better at pattern detection then                                 computers are so with that in mind came                                 a project called planet hunters and                                 planet hunters which I believe is that                                 planet hunters org is a project in which                                 it makes all of this NASA Kepler data                                 available to anyone to look at and                                 actually bets that humans can probably                                 find some exoplanets that NASA otherwise                                 would have left behind would have not                                 detected and so you can actually look at                                 this light curve data and see if you can                                 see any small dips in brightness and if                                 you see any small dips in brightness in                                 this data you might well be on your way                                 to discovering an X opponent and                                 actually through planet hunters a number                                 of people have discovered exoplanets so                                 far which is pretty awesome and the                                 awesome part of this is that if you                                 discover an exoplanet your name goes on                                 that scientific paper so you're not                                 doing some work for some scientist who's                                 going to take the credit for you the                                 work you do on planet hunters actually                                 gets credited to you so you might                                 actually be able to discover a planet                                 we've never discovered before in our                                 galaxy which is pretty awesome if you                                 ask me                                 um there's a love projects like planet                                 hunters or you can discover galaxies                                 planets a bunch of different things on a                                 website called space hack org and space                                 hack org is a directory of ways to                                 participate in space exploration it's                                 something that I sort of hacked together                                 in a couple weeks after I had left NASA                                 so I love more awesome projects like                                 planet hunters is at this website in                                 case you're interested closer to home                                 there are some planets that are fairly                                 popular as well this is a great image of                                 Mars and Mars is a planet that has                                 gained a lot of popularity recently not                                 only with the Mars curiosity landing                                 last year but also with with a lot of                                 people talking about sending humans to                                 Mars now which is pretty exciting to                                 think about if that could happen in our                                 lifetime and a lot of people are                                 planning that it will here in Germany                                 you actually have a really great                                 resource that's adjacent to you there's                                 a great great organization called the                                 Austrian space forum and if you haven't                                 heard of them i definitely recommend                                 that you look them up essentially the                                 austrian space forum is an organization                                 of people from all different types of                                 backgrounds who want to actually                                 simulate what it's like to travel to                                 Mars here on earth and by doing that                                 they're creating research that's                                 actually really invaluable for anyone                                 who wants to eventually go to Mars                                 because they're studying how to best                                 design space suits new Rovers that we                                 could be using the psychology of what                                 it's like to actually be on Mars etc and                                 they really need help from all different                                 types of people to really make this                                 research great and so the Austrian space                                 forum is just a great organization that                                 anyone can get involved in they do a lot                                 of really cool things this was I think                                 they were exploring an ice cave in                                 Austria which looks awesome they were                                 kind of looking for microbes that might                                 be in the ice caves thinking that when                                 we explore Mars if we were to find any                                 life there it might be in the form of                                 microbes are embedded in ice so a lot of                                 this work is really around figuring out                                 how we best as humans could maybe one                                 day colonize Mars but before we send any                                 humans there a more likely candidate                                 colonize Mars might be something like                                 this something a lot more simple and                                 this is actually an image of lichen and                                 lichen is actually a fascinating orgas                                 organism because it was one of the first                                 things that really helped colonize the                                 earth a long time ago this is because                                 lichen helps break down bear rock                                 surfaces to sort of give a foothold for                                 future life-forms to take place and                                 we've actually been able to test like in                                 and simulate Mars like environments for                                 liking and been able to determine that                                 like and could actually survive on the                                 surface of Mars so it's actually kind of                                 cool to think about something that                                 helped colonize the earth a long time                                 ago might be one of the things that we                                 use to sort of help colonize Mars in the                                 future in the meantime though the only                                 colonizers of Mars are going to be                                 robots like this one this is an outline                                 of the Mars Curiosity robot compared to                                 the size of a man I thought this was a                                 really strange image because it looks                                 like that robot wants to murder the man                                 it's a very evil robot I think so a lot                                 of these sort of things that we will be                                 sending to Mars in the meantime are                                 robots and here in Germany you have a                                 bunch of cool robots already maybe not                                 one's going to Mars but one's going to                                 the moon you have adorable German robots                                 here uh a lot of you I'm sure are                                 familiar the google lunar xprize has a                                 team in Berlin called the part-time                                 scientists and they build these adorable                                 robots that might one day explore the                                 lunar surface which is great and the                                 google lunar x prize is a                                            dollar competition to sort of build a                                 robot and send it to the moon and while                                 it's a really exciting competition and                                 people hope to be sending these robots                                 to the moon within the next couple of                                 years or so unfortunately the                                 competition is closed to any new teams                                 but there are other projects you can get                                 involved with projects like the                                 university rover challenge the                                 university rover challenge tasks                                 universities from around the world to                                 try building the next generation of mars                                 rovers and this is just a great program                                 because if you come up with something                                 that's actually really unique you have                                 access to people at NASA to people at                                 different space agencies who might                                 actually                                 incorporate your technology into the                                 next generation Mars rover so it's a                                 pretty cool competition to think about I                                 think it actually outlines an                                 interesting area where I think more                                 people should be involved in building                                 new ways to sort of do Mars rovers                                 because sometimes they have some                                 problems like this one this was a one of                                 the University Rovers I think Rovers                                 could be sort of imagined in a much more                                 creative way instead of sort of building                                 them like cars in a sense to me some of                                 the most interesting concepts for Rovers                                 have been ones that have come from                                 unexpected sources in a sense my                                 favorite Mars rover prototype was built                                 around this concept of a tumbleweed and                                 so someone imagined what if the way a                                 tumbleweed goes across the surface of                                 the earth what if we could have a rover                                 go across the surface of Mars much like                                 a tumbleweed does so it was really                                 interesting and it's something that                                 actually people at NASA for the last ten                                 years or so have been prototyping sort                                 of these concepts for Martian Rovers                                 that instead of acting like cards would                                 actually just tumble across the Martian                                 surface which is really great and so                                 sort of with this whole idea of                                 exploring the unknown and sort of                                 mashing things together in unexpected                                 ways it reminds me of my most favorite                                 story from a science hack day and this                                 was of a hack called a beard detector                                 someone a science hack day wanted to                                 create a device that would essentially                                 detect when he needed to shave I don't                                 know why don't ask me why but he was                                 very particular about shaving and so                                 this hacker hacked together this USB                                 microscope like you can see here and he                                 took this USB microscope and he held it                                 up to his face and he got some really                                 gross images of the stubble on his face                                 it was kind of gross but he wrote some                                 basic code and used an open computer                                 vision library and was able to actually                                 you know determine the lines around his                                 face so this is an image of the beard                                 detector in action                                 as you can see as saying no beard found                                 no beard found and then you know it's                                 drawing lines around the stubble on his                                 face and telling him when he needs to                                 shave so when I first saw this I thought                                 to myself that's cool I guess I'm not                                 really sure what it has to do with                                 science at all but you know as I said                                 with science hack day people could build                                 whatever they want but sitting in the                                 audience and seeing this hack demoed was                                 a particle physicist and was when this                                 particle physicist saw this hack demoed                                 he said to himself wow that's actually a                                 genius way for how to detect cosmic rays                                 in a cloud chamber which sounds                                 ridiculous until you actually see what                                 cosmic rays in a cloud chamber looks                                 like and so after something it's hack                                 day this particle physicists wrote up                                 this entire proposal for how to detect                                 cosmic rays in a cloud chamber using the                                 original code and open computer vision                                 library someone had used to detect if he                                 needed to shave or not and to me this is                                 just what I love so much about hacking                                 and hack days it's really just around                                 creating sparks for future ideas and                                 future collaborations and just smashing                                 things up and seeing where they go and                                 so science hack days have been all                                 around the world there's sort of events                                 that no one owns it is not an                                 organization there's open source                                 instructions for how to organize one                                 science hack day calm and we've just                                 seen the events just grow this was an                                 image from science hack day in Chicago                                 where we got to hack a planetarium which                                 was pretty cool this here was an image                                 from science hack day in Kenya where                                 people made a lot of robotic tax which                                 was a lot of fun and I wanted to ask all                                 of you here if maybe collectively                                 somehow we could create a science hack                                 day in Berlin because there is such an                                 awesome community here all of you here                                 all the hackerspace is here the artists                                 the designers the scientists there                                 should already be a science hack day in                                 Berlin so if all of us together could                                 maybe collectively make that happen and                                 I'm happy to help you as much as I can                                 create a science hack day in Berlin I                                 think that would be real                                 awesome and I have no doubt you guys                                 would create some of the most awesome                                 hacks we've ever seen so to me when I'm                                 thinking about science and space                                 exploration in what we could be                                 searching for we could be searching for                                 extraterrestrials or exoplanets a lot of                                 different things but to me it's really                                 the search for experimentation that's so                                 incredibly precious and I think we've                                 found it through hacking science and                                 hacking space exploration thank you                                 you                                 you
