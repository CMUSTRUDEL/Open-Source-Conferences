Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2013: Zeno Gantner - Recommender Systems Experiments with MyMediaLite #bbuzz
Publication date: 2013-06-19
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2013 #bbuzz
Description: 
	Recommendations based on collaborative filtering are a popular feature on many websites.
Picking the right collaborative filtering algorithm and configuring it correctly for your specific use case is not straightforward.

In this talk I will show how to perform offline experiments with MyMediaLite. I will discuss useful evaluation protocols and metrics for information retrieval and recommendation systems, and demonstrate how to measure them with MyMediaLite.

	                              okay thank you so I will talk about                               offline experiments for recommender                               systems that is if you have several                               different methods and that you                               potentially want to deploy how can you                               compare them to decide which one is                               better and i will use the my media light                               package as an example throughout the                               talk but everything that I that I say so                                the core message is independent of this                                tool so you can even if you're not if                                you do not intend to try this out you                                can you can still follow the talk and                                you will get some interesting messages                                except you're already a machine learning                                guru something like that and most of the                                lessons are even not limited to                                recommendation to but to to it to                                everything where you want to make                                predictions from data and yeah in the                                end you know you will have time for                                questions so I work here in Berlin at                                nokia we work on here maps on the here                                maps platform where around                                           here and this here maps platform is used                                to power several mobile apps by Nokia                                for instance nokia here drive where you                                can see a screenshot here so your drive                                is a is an app that turns your mobile                                phone into a kind of car navigation                                system there are also other apps like                                Hugh maps or here transit which is a                                public transport map applications and we                                also serve external customers like                                Microsoft's of bing maps and Yahoo Maps                                that is if you go to I'd say to Bing                                Maps you will see on the lower right                                corner something that states powered by                                Nokia um that is we we we provide and                                even deliver map tiles in real time to                                Bing Maps bing maps are also used on                                facebook so it's very likely that you've                                seen those Maps                                and we also work with major car                                companies like beam double that BMW                                Volkswagen Mercedes Toyota etc so                                basically we we deliver maps to                                everything that has a screen I                                personally I work on the search team at                                here maps I think it's done it's an                                awesome team we're we're in Boston here                                in Berlin we some of us participate in                                in open-source development for instance                                some of us committed a part and not                                committed I'm contributed to the latest                                version of avila seen you can you can                                see the links down there if you if                                you're interested in details there i                                will also publish the slides later so                                you don't have to do this now we are                                also regular participants of this                                conference here also some links of of                                talks that were that were given in the                                recent year so you can you can look look                                up the videos if you're interested in                                what we are doing and what we are                                talking about so I think we're pretty                                awesome team minutes it's really fun to                                work here good so now back to the topic                                imagine your your boss wants you two to                                implement a recommender foreign for an                                existing system right so you already                                have a have a website you already have                                lots of data and you want to you want to                                add a personalization feature and maybe                                you even have some idea which which                                algorithms to use or even you have                                already implementations of those                                algorithms either you did it yourself or                                you use some open source a toolkit for                                instance mahout of course or there are                                also other alternatives like GraphLab so                                you pretty much already have the major                                building blocks to                                to have a to come up with a good                                recommender system but there is still a                                problem and none of so so you none of                                those packages provide you really ready                                to use solutions for exactly your use                                case and of course none of those come                                with models that are already fine-tuned                                for exactly your use case so so what are                                you going to do you have data you have                                algorithms but you do not really know                                how to glue them together of course in                                the end you will have the let the user                                decide what's best so of course live                                user testing is something that that you                                want to consider but very often you you                                 need to know what to put in front of the                                 those live users you so you cannot just                                 try out everything so and in order to                                 decide what to what to deploy Watership                                 you may want to use offline experiments                                 that means you use data that you                                 collected on your website and you                                 partition this data into into one part                                 that you use for training your model and                                 then you try to predict what is in the                                 other part of your data and this is your                                 test set and this is what you do and                                 actually this is something that not only                                 happens if you if you're interested in                                 in real world deployment and coming up                                 with a real system but it is also that                                 something that that happens in other                                 places as well take for instance data                                 mining competitions like the k DD cup or                                 your Kegel who here knows Kegel ok                                 anybody has already participated in a                                 competition there no I think I know                                 someone here in here what anyway good so                                 if you if you want to participate here                                 you also you need to compare different                                 different different methods and you need                                 to be sure what to submit their to to be                                 able to compete right so this is this is                                 also something where you can use                                 knowledge and skills about offline                                 experiments                                 and of course if you're a researcher so                                 if you came up with a new fancy data                                 mining or machine learning technique you                                 want to sell it to your to your peers so                                 you want to actually prove that this                                 method is is worth considering so you                                 want to compare it to existing methods                                 so that you also need to know how to how                                 to perform offline experiments right so                                 the question is the same for for all                                 these cases you have data you have                                 methods and now how do you compare them                                 okay i will i will use my media light                                 the software as an example throughout                                 the talk and then we'll cover a few of                                 those topics so how do you how do you                                 deal with your with your data which                                 methods could you compare against what                                 do you want to avoid when comparing                                 methods how do you measure how do you                                 actually measure the performance of a                                 method how do you find you in a method                                 and how can you make sure that                                 everything you try out is reproducible                                 ok so my media light is a recommender                                 system toolkit which means it contains                                 many different recommender system                                 algorithms like collaborative filtering                                 but also other things different matrix                                 factorization techniques or                                 state-of-the-art recommender system                                 methods and it contains also a an                                 extensive evaluation framework which is                                 maybe because it it comes from a more                                 academic heritage rather than let's say                                 mahout but I would argue that also the                                 simulation framework is this is a it's                                 practical outside of academics as well                                 so what is my meter light so it's it's                                 basically it's a it's a dotnet library                                 it's it's written                                 csharp in                                                            limited to windows so something like                                 that it runs basically everywhere the                                 main development happens on Linux                                 actually you can use this library from                                 different programming languages like C                                 sharp Titan Ruby F sharp if you're more                                 inclined to use Java there are also two                                 to two different Java ports of the                                 package one of those ports is used in a                                 plugin for the rapid minor software so                                 there you have a nice gooey and you can                                 you can use the different recommenders                                 inside the GUI yeah so there are there                                 were regular releases of the software on                                 two to three months a cycle so pretty                                 pretty rapid actually it's rather it's                                 all it's rather simple so it's easy to                                 use you have a have lots of choice in                                 selecting different methods different                                 ways of evaluating your methods it's of                                 course free software stock your man that                                 it's tested if you are interested in the                                 details have a look at the website IG                                 the source code is also available on                                 github so if you if you have suggestions                                 for improvements you can also send send                                 us pull requests I said it's it's a                                 library but it's not only a library it                                 also provides several command line tools                                 so you can use a lot of the                                 functionality without having to program                                 just by using simple command-line tools                                 that read data run the recommenders and                                 give you results and during this talk I                                 will mostly focus on this item                                 recommendation tool command line tool                                 and if you want to try out those                                 examples you will find them all on                                 github actually you already can find                                 them there so I i uploaded them                                 yesterday so you can replay everything                                 so there's a make file and all the all                                 the stuff you need and you just                                 just try you can just try out they cut                                 the command line set of resent you and                                 throughout the talk whenever there's                                 something in this light blue and my                                 media light logo next to it this is an                                 example how you will concretely call my                                 media lied to to try out this this                                 certain feature and most most lessons or                                 most guidelines i will i will tell you                                 will be accompanied by such a such an                                 example okay but still everything you                                 will hear you can you can you can do                                 without worrying about the software okay                                 let's start with with the data so Ted                                 already said something how the data can                                 look like so in some systems you have                                 explicit feedback where users explicitly                                 state their preference I like this a lot                                 i don't like this i give this three and                                 a half stars this is called explicit                                 feedback the problem is it's not always                                 there and it's hard to to make users                                 contribute such feedback so more in most                                 systems you won't have this so we won't                                 look any further at this for now and                                 what's much more interesting is implicit                                 feedback so those are actions by the                                 users that are that that happened in the                                 in the regular interaction of the user                                 with a system and it's not necessarily                                 an exquisite statement of a user                                 preference the user doesn't by clicking                                 on something the user doesn't explicitly                                 say i like this or I don't like this                                 it's just it's just something that we                                 want to infer and such empty implicit                                 feedback can be for instance views on                                 websites or or clicks or purchase                                 actions so someone buy something and                                 very often this is positive only that                                 means you only observe what a person                                 buys but you do not observe what a                                 person decides against buying because                                 people just don't tell this it they                                 don't tell you oh I don't I didn't buy                                 this product because I didn't like it                                 yeah so we will we will concentrate on                                 on implicit feedback and positive only                                 feedback                                 okay so how did this what this should                                 look familiar to you so how does such                                 data look like we have a we have users                                 users can be specified by IDs can be                                 numerical IDs could be also strings                                 names whatever and we have items so say                                 as a ted call them things so everything                                 that you want to want to recommend for                                 instance newspaper articles products etc                                 web links item ids can also be numbers                                 or they can be just almost arbitrary                                 strings and maybe you have time stamps                                 but time stems are optional maybe you                                 didn't record time steps maybe you're                                 not interested in x terms maybe you're                                 very interested in them and so usually                                 you would have them in a let's say                                 comma-separated file right and my media                                 light can then read this in so you you                                 provide a training file and a test file                                 because as i said generally for for                                 offline experiments you have one part of                                 your data that you use for training your                                 models and then you have one part of the                                 data that you try to predict where you                                 try to predict those user item                                 interactions and this tests data set is                                 used to judge how well your algorithm                                 actually works and you can just provide                                 those two files to my meter light and it                                 will run the experiments for you so one                                 thing of course that you need to take                                 care about his debt those don't overlap                                 because then it's kind of easy you you                                 will you will have models that can                                 exactly predict what's in the test set                                 if you if you already have this in the                                 training set but i think this is                                 something should be obvious okay so                                 sometimes you do not have your split you                                 have not decided yet on how to do your                                 split because it's not obvious how to do                                 splits so my meter light can also do                                 this for you the simple the most simple                                 of split is a random split which means                                 you just say which which ratio of your                                 data do you want to use for evaluation                                 and which do you want to use for                                 training so in this example we use one                                 quarter of our data for for testing and                                 how does this work in detail you use                                 your your list of user item interactions                                 you shuffle it and then you just split                                 it you take the first                                                  and the rest the the other twenty-five                                 percent for testing so this is very                                 simple there are some problems with it                                 for instance you do not take temporal                                 trends into account here and you also do                                 not use all your data for testing you're                                 only used was twenty five percent for                                 testing and maybe you want to make                                 optimal use of your data so there is a                                 method that you can use where you can                                 make use of all data points for                                 evaluation and this is called cross                                 validation or K for cross validation how                                 does this work so you you partition your                                 data into K different parts in this                                 example into four different parts and                                 you use each part once for testing and                                 you always use the rest of the data for                                 training so this is drawn here so first                                 you you use the the last twenty five                                 percent and then the next to last etc                                 and in the end you you just average over                                 your results and that's it and the the                                 advantage here is it uses really each                                 data point for for evaluation it still                                 does not take temporal trends into                                 account                                 of course you there is also a way to                                 take such trends into account in your                                 tests and that is a chronological split                                 so there you do not shuffle your data                                 but you sort it according to the                                 timestamps that you hopefully have and                                 then you use the past up to a certain                                 point in time to predict the future so                                 the future here is of course not the                                 real future but the future at that point                                 in time that you record it and the nice                                 thing is that this takes trends in your                                 data into account for instance the time                                 of the day or the day of the week                                 because consumer behavior may be                                 different on weekends and during                                 weekdays and we know that consumer                                 behavior is different in certain seasons                                 that's for instance before Christmas                                 people buy different stuff maybe they                                 buy larger gifts than during the year                                 and so on there are also product that                                 can be trending so a new movie will be                                 received differently by by users when it                                 is new then after                                                     you want to do use this feature in my                                 media lie to you you just tell it that                                 you want a chronological split and you                                 tell the ratio for instance again                                 twenty-five percent that would mean it                                 would use the the last twenty-five                                 percent for validation or you can                                 provide it with a with a date then this                                 will be the splitting date and                                 everything before will be used for                                 training and everything after will be                                 used for validation okay so what's that                                 this anybody knows it's a baseline okay                                 bad joke rhaggy baseline um and this is                                 spelled differently but it sounds the                                 same so what about our baseline methods                                 based baseline methods are the methods                                 that you that you compare against and                                 you should always compare against                                 something because absolute numbers have                                 almost no meaning if you if you measure                                 if you measure your new fancy algorithm                                 and you you get in the end a number                                 let's say                                                           always need to look at at numbers in in                                 relative comparison to other things for                                 instance how how well does my new fancy                                 method work if I compare it to the                                 existing state of the art or even just a                                 very simple method relative numbers can                                 also have no meanings if you're doing it                                 wrong but I will come to this later so                                 what do you want to kill compare against                                 so what is a good baseline first of all                                 you want to check against simple bass                                 lines so one good baseline is the                                 strongest solution it's still very                                 simple maybe you try to improve an                                 existing system then then of course the                                 existing solution if you have already an                                 existing recommender algorithm is also                                 your baseline you want to compare                                 against this and you want to be better                                 than this and also there are certain                                 standard solutions where there may be                                 open source implementations already like                                 KN based collaborative filtering or                                 plain vanilla matrix factorization                                 methods and often you also want to                                 compare against these because you should                                 kind of be able to to judge why your                                 messages is better than all of those so                                 otherwise you usually do not have a                                 reason to use this other method if                                 you're not better than standard                                 solutions if you're not better than the                                 existing solution if you're not better                                 than something very simple why do you                                 want to use your current method why                                 don't you stick with the existing                                 solution why don't you use something                                 more simple so how does this work in my                                 media light so Miami delight lets you                                 select a recommender and and there of                                 course also many many baseline simple                                 baseline methods for instance you want                                 to be better than random recommendations                                 right it's something that you should try                                 to to achieve or you also want to be                                 better if you if you have some fancy                                 personalization method you want to be                                 better than just taking the most popular                                 items                                 you can also take the the most popular                                 items by certain attributes what I mean                                 by that is that lets say you you have a                                 movie recommender and a user mostly                                 watch this comedy movies then maybe                                 instead of showing this you this user                                 the globally most popular movies you                                 just show the user the the most popular                                 comedy movies instead of action movies                                 finest right okay apples and oranges so                                 i already i already mentioned this                                 sometimes a relative comparison still                                 doesn't tell you anything and this                                 happens if you do compare the wrong                                 things I mean it should be obvious that                                 you do not compare the wrong things but                                 maybe it's not that obvious so it                                 actually happens more often than you may                                 think and it happens also to really                                 really smart people for instance there                                 was a paper at this year's icml so icml                                 is the International Conference on                                 machine learning it's a really high                                 profile conferences conference so lots                                 of math involved the the really big                                 names in machine learning published                                 there and so on and there was there was                                 a paper about recommendation so I I I                                 was interested in that and I read the                                 paper and yeah it's it it suggests a                                 very new and fancy method lots of math                                 beautiful formulas and then I had a look                                 at at the evaluation so of course the                                 emulation was done the standard way so                                 you take an existing data set and you                                 split it like like I told you and then                                 you predict it then you try to predict                                 the rest of the data set and then you                                 compare it against existing methods and                                 so for for rating prediction so this                                 paper was about writing prediction there                                 is this gold standard of the netflix                                 price solution so the netflix price was                                 there was a competition several years                                 ago                                 that had a prize money of                                           dollar so it was a very competitive                                 competition and in the end a huge team                                 had a huge blended solution and I think                                 it was after two years day they want                                 this competition with a huge blended                                 solution that consisted of hundreds of                                 individual models and so what the                                 authors claim in the abstract is we can                                 see that Norma's or that's the name of                                 the new method also outperforms the                                 netflix winner arm is e arm is e is the                                 metric that is used as well as other                                 bass lines so they claim to to beat the                                 netflix price solution which is pretty                                 remarkable especially if it's a single                                 model right so so I had a look at the                                 details and sorry I have to go now a                                 little bit into details for that I will                                 try to explain to you the details so                                 they have this nice picture here and so                                 the so the lines here the those four                                 highlighted lines are already the new                                 method and the dashed lines are some                                 baseline methods in this in this case it                                 is the it's called SVD so it's a kind of                                 matrix factorization method and here                                 there is this very small dotted line                                 that represents the netflix a price                                 solution so n it I don't know I don't                                 know whether you see this in the back of                                 the room but the suggested method in one                                 configuration beats this and so it's                                 that's pretty remarkable but then if you                                 read the caption of the figure it says                                 the netflix when the arm is e is based                                 on the qualifying set from the netflix                                 competition while our results use a                                 randomly sampled data set of similar                                 size so the size is of the data set is                                 the same but the way the sample is                                 different because the the netflix                                 winners they had to use past data to                                 train the model and then predict the                                 future whereas the authors sampled from                                 from ratings from every                                 there and used part of that what they                                 sampled from everywhere for training and                                 the rest they use for prediction so they                                 had access to some part of the future in                                 order to predict the future of course                                 this makes it a little bit easier to                                 predict the future if you know already                                 something about the future right and if                                 you if you see the the y-axis here the                                 baseline results are around                                            if you look at the deluded literature on                                 on the netflix price data set is that                                 whenever you have such chronological                                 splits that that where you really have                                 to predict the future you see that those                                 baseline metrics vectorization never                                 perform below zero point nine they are                                 always worse so lower is better here so                                 chronological splits can be much much                                 harder than random splits and in this                                 case the authors just claimed oh we                                 haven't we have a number here that's                                 that's lower than the other number so we                                 win but they didn't or did they mention                                 that they measured in in a it in a                                 different way but they still draw draw                                 drew the conclusion that that because of                                 that they were better but it's like if                                 you compare the speed of two cars you                                 have you have this old car and you have                                 just this new car and and then you                                 measure the speed and you use let's say                                 a cross-country you wrote for the old                                 car and then racing track for the new                                 car and then you say okay we only need                                 five minutes for the track it and then                                 you compare it against the cross-country                                 measurement I don't know it would you be                                 convinced about this so here I also I I                                 was not convinced and I hope you are not                                 convinced to and if this happens to such                                 people so the the authors of the paper                                 are big names and machine learning if it                                 if it happens to those people it can                                 happen maybe to everyone so it may be                                 something you need to be careful about                                 when you when you perform your own                                 experiments and there are there are                                 several lessons we can                                 in here so of course first we should not                                 compare between different kinds of                                 splits like simple splits and                                 chronological splits and but we also                                 learn something that that bass lines are                                 important because they can help us to                                 kind of debug experiments so so what                                 what was very good by the authors is                                 that they not only report it their new                                 results against the published results                                 but they are not but they also performed                                 experiments with baseline methods and                                 also reported these because it allows                                 the reader to better church what's going                                 on and also even if you do not publish                                 your results it allows you to judge much                                 better what is going on if you compared                                 to base language does it it's it makes                                 it much easier to debug things okay                                 another question is of course is whether                                 a rating prediction is really the most                                 important problem to work on in in                                      but that's a different story okay so I                                 talked a lot about measurements and                                 metrics but I haven't mentioned any so                                 how do you measure things in your                                 offline experiments getting the right                                 metric isn't really not easy and very                                 often you can only approximately find                                 the right metric but there there are                                 some things that you need to keep in                                 mind so you should really know your goal                                 what has the final system what does the                                 final system do what should it do what                                 how should it help the user and this                                 goal should influence your choice of the                                 metric right so you need to know what                                 you want to measure you also should be                                 very very careful about your metric                                 metrics you should always criticize your                                 metrics because it can happen that that                                 they ignore important aspects of your                                 problem and yeah as I said they are just                                 approximations of user behavior so you                                 should always have or at least watch                                 several metrics and besides using the                                 metrics to raw numbers you should also                                 eyeball your results that means                                 you do not rely only on the numbers but                                 just let your model predict some some                                 items for some users and really look at                                 the results because they there may be                                 things that that you did you fail to see                                 with your metrics for instance there are                                 WTF results so what the free                                 commendations there is a nice nice blog                                 post by by Daniel tonka lang off of                                 linkedin the link is in here you don't                                 really see it but I will provide the                                 slides later so you can read it it's                                 it's a blog post really really worth                                 reading so Daniel basically suggests to                                 to not only measure traditional metrics                                 but also really measure the the WTF                                 results that you see in the first k                                 results it's really worth reading this                                 this blog post okay so I said there are                                 many different metrics or what are good                                 metrics one good metric that I want to                                 suggest is precision at K because it's                                 it's very simple so what is precision it                                 k it's just the number of correct items                                 in the top k results buy coreg I mean                                 item that is in your that is in there's                                 in your test data it's not really                                 correct and in in the real world but for                                 the sake of the experiment it's the                                 correct items and the choice of K is can                                 be is specific to your application it                                 may depend on things like screen size                                 and so etc and the good thing about this                                 is very simple and it's it's easy to                                 understand and it's also easy to explain                                 for instance to your manager there are                                 also of course other measures like nect                                 mean average precision etc but they all                                 they all are already more complicated                                 and you you need to discuss a lot more                                 why you use them and so on and again and                                 in my view like you can you can just                                 provide a list of measures to the tool                                 and it will output the experiment in                                 those measures so one example for                                 precision at K this is precision at for                                 what why would it make sense for                                 Institute have precision at four maybe                                 you have an a restaurant recommendation                                 application                                 and it's all it's a mobile application                                 so you have limited screen real estate                                 and you know that on average maybe you                                 can explain for a display for different                                 results so you use precision at four and                                 how do you measure it so you know in                                 this example that the first result is                                 bad second is good third is bad forces                                 bad and the rest you can ignore and it                                 just count the number of of good results                                 in your top four and you divide it by                                   so here the precision at K is                                         quarter and that's it okay so next thing                                 hyper parameter tuning what's this so                                 more every method that is let's say more                                 complex then the most popular has                                 certain hyper parameters this is just                                 those are values that you put into your                                 into the learning or prediction                                 algorithm that decide certain thresholds                                 and so on for instance there are                                 regularization parameters that control                                 over fitting or learning rates for for                                 gradient descent techniques and stopping                                 criteria for iterative algorithms and so                                 on and they all influence the quality of                                 your recommendations and if someone                                 comes up with a complicated method that                                 does not have those they are there but                                 implicitly and you don't tune them so                                 it's also not a good idea and if you do                                 not tune them properly you may have sub                                 optimal results so you always want to                                 want to optimize them and you also want                                 to do this of course for your baselines                                 because otherwise you also do not have a                                 fair comparison so how can you do this                                 in my media light there's this w RM f                                 this a matrix factorization techniques I                                 think it's also available in my hood and                                 it has one of those regularization                                 options so you can just set recommend                                 the options and you would set this                                 and that's it but but still you would                                 have to to do some manual work to find a                                 good value here right of course this can                                 be automated but my suggestion again is                                 here you just don't get too fancy very                                 often simple methods really do it it's                                 an easy script for instance to implement                                 grid search that just tries out a lots                                 of parameters in that in a brute force                                 met way and this will do it in most                                 cases there are some more advanced                                 methods like like the simplex method but                                 yeah s said very often grid search will                                 do it so so what is grid search so this                                 is a picture that I stole from from from                                 last year's talk by my colleague Stefan                                 but it it gives some nice details on                                 grid search so suppose you have two                                 different parameters so you just try out                                 several parameter values for each of                                 those parameters and then you pick the D                                 results in this case the this thing that                                 is marked red you pick those results                                 that give you the best best metric you                                 pick those parameters that give you the                                 best results so one question I often get                                 is ok I have this I have this this one                                 parameter and I have no idea at all to                                 which value to set it so it could be                                                                                                    should i pick and this example gives                                 gives gives away how to solve this so                                 instead of having a linear scale you                                 should use a for instance a logarithmic                                 scale so either to the power of                                          the to the power of                                                      can cover large large numerical spaces                                 with with your grid search alright and                                 grid search has several real examples so                                 real advantages so it's very simple it's                                 brute force tits of course not an                                 advantage but it's also embarrassing the                                 parallel so it's really easy to paralyze                                 this either on your box or on on a                                 cluster you don't need any fancy thing                                 to parallelize it if you want to learn                                 more about                                 research what I can recommend is this                                 practical guide to SVM classification so                                 it's not about recommendations but about                                 some support vector machines but it's a                                 very very accessible piece that's                                 written by the authors of the lib SVM                                 and live linear software and it also                                 explains how grid search works and it                                 explains how as we m's work and I think                                 it's a really nice piece of paper yeah                                 so this is something I can really                                 recommend okay so the last topic or less                                 guideline is reproducible experiments I                                 think over Schindler who stood here                                 yesterday he talked about also about                                 random testing and but if you want to                                 find box with random testing you also                                 need to be able to reproduce your your                                 these situations you encountered while                                 testing randomly and justice you can do                                 by fixing the random seed that you use                                 for your random number generator and                                 this just you can also do with my media                                 light you can you can fix the random                                 seed and with this you can either better                                 debug your your experiments but you can                                 also make sure for instance that you                                 always compare on the same random split                                 because of course the random split is                                 also influenced by the by the choice of                                 random seat now there may be also                                 message that initialize there they're                                 modeled with with random numbers so                                 there's also something where you want to                                 use this of course there are a lot of                                 other aspects to to reproducible                                 experiments besides picking the random                                 seat so one is that you did you are in                                 control of what you tried at which point                                 in time for this I suggest that you put                                 everything into a version control system                                 so your data your software your scripts                                 your configuration if you have lots of                                 data of course you cannot put into                                 subversion or get you need to come up                                 with clever solutions here but you                                 should you should have a system that                                 enables you to to go back in history and                                                                                                       came up with because that may be your                                 your your boss will come around the                                 corner and ask you about this in that                                 detail that you told him about three                                 weeks ago                                 oh and you just pull it out of your                                 laptop but you do not know how to                                 reconstruct this anymore and that's kind                                 of difficult if you if you want to make                                 decisions based on data and you can also                                 use tools build tools like make that                                 were originally developed for for for                                 software you can use them for for the                                 automation of such quantitative                                 experiments because make a certain of                                 advantages it knows when you went to                                 rerun your your different data                                 processing steps that you may have and                                 so on and if you change something and                                 let's say at the beginning of the                                 pipeline it exactly knows when to when                                 to rerun things there's also a nice a                                 blog post about about using make for for                                 data science or data experiments I can                                 also recommend this okay and another                                 aspect of reproducible experiments is                                 evaluation so it's it's a good idea to                                 reuse evaluation code because it's not                                 always easy and simple to implement                                 evaluation protocols so that's splitting                                 and and also the metrics and many many                                 details can be done differently and                                 wrong so if it's wrong it's wrong anyway                                 and you have a problem if it's                                 differently sometimes things are just                                 different then you also have a problem                                 because then you have again this apples                                 and oranges thing so maybe you want to                                 use the same software at least for                                 evaluating the output of different                                 recommenders so the recommendations can                                 come from different tools but maybe you                                 want to use to the same tool for for                                 coming up with your metrics in the end                                 and this is also something you can do                                 with my media light so there is one                                 recommender called the external item                                 recommender and this this recommend has                                 just given a file with scores and those                                 scores can be generated by any software                                 and then you can use everything that is                                 already in there for for evaluation yeah                                 so this I already told you about right                                 so in relation protocols are not easy to                                 get right and it ensures comparable                                 comparability and you also may be lazy                                 and you don't don't want to re-implement                                 your metrics in every environment                                 okay so let's put it in a nutshell what                                 have you seen some short guidelines or                                 or messages from your talk from the talk                                 that you maybe can take home with you                                 you should split your data appropriately                                 for your for your use case you should                                 not compare apples and oranges you                                 should compare again simple and but also                                 strong base lines we've seen precision                                                                                                          easy to explain grid search is a simple                                 method for for tuning your models you                                 should strive to make your experiments                                 reproducible and of course my media                                 light can help you with some of those                                 things if you want to work on                                 recommender system data so i encourage                                 you to try it out good so as said you                                 you can see all the examples on github I                                 will upload the slides today tonight                                 please have a look at at the home page                                 of my meter light and maybe also at the                                 source code if you're interested and                                 that's it thank                                 you                                 you
