Description: 
	Apache Drill is an exciting project that aims to provide SQL query capabilities for a wide variety of data sources in an extensible way.

But the technologies underneath the implementation are also very exciting even outside of the context of Drill itself. These ideas can be repurposed for a wide variety of other uses either by directly extracting code from Drill, or by using the philosophies and ideas in new forms.

I will talk about how Drill goes about several key tasks including: forming a DAG of operations and binding these operations to real code. Drill does this using a JSON concrete syntax so that the DAG can be created or executed in a variety of implementation languages including Java and C++. moving schema-free or flexible schema nested data through an execution DAG as efficiently as data with a rigid relational schema. Drill uses a novel column oriented format with a new batch adaptive schema technology. This allows the inefficiencies associated with non-columnar data or with flexible schemas to be confined to the data sources where the penalty is only paid once.
