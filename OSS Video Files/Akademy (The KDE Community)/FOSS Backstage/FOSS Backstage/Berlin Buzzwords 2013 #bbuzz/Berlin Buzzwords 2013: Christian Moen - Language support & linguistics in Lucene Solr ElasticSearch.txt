Description: 
	Full title: Language support and linguistics in Lucene/Solr/elasticsearch and the open source and commercial eco-system

In search, language processing is often key to getting a good search experience. This talk gives an overview of language handling and linguistics functionality in Lucene/Solr/ElasticSearch and best-practices for using them to handle Western, Asian and multi-language deployments. Pointers and references within the open source and commercial eco-systems for more advanced linguistics and their applications are also discussed.

The presentation is mix of overview and hands-on best-practices the audience can benefit immediately from in their Lucene, Solr or ElasticSearch deployments. The eco-system part is meant to inspire how more advanced functionality can be developed by means of the available open source technologies within the Apache eco-system (predominantly) while also highlighting some of the commercial options available.
