Description: 
	Open source projects such as those that are part of the Apache Open Source Foundation are community-built projects with the architecting, translation into logical plan and code production being contributed by a group of developers around the world. But open source projects are also community-driven: the need for specific applications is identified by the community of potential users as well as by the developers. There are a variety of ways that people can contribute to open source besides developing and committing code.

For people with sufficient technical background, writing expert documentation is a very valuable contribution to an open source project. Other less technical contributions also are possible. Communication about the development of new projects and about how to use mature projects helps projects reach an audience beyond those who are directly involved. Community + code is essential to a successful and vibrant project, so people who help build community are helping to build the project. Contributions can include work on project websites and wikis, help with progress reports, writing how-to manuals or tutorials, identifying trends for use cases and connection via social media such as Twitter.

I will present concrete strategies for doing these kinds of contributions, using examples from current open source projects. This session is aimed at both coders and non-coders, with tips for encouraging cooperative exchange of ideas during meetings, in social media and on mailing list discussions. The session will be interactive, gathering input from the audience about the challenges they face in working with a diffuse community and about the actions they can take to foster cooperation, enthusiasm and a productive exhange of ideas.

	                              okay Wow a lot of people stayed that's                               good so this talk has had various names                               originally it was going to be an open                               stage talk and it's kind of change shape                               to come here a house and slides prepared                               have a few ideas I'd like to share with                               you but mainly I would like to keep time                               to involve all of you in hearing back                               from you what you're doing and I'm                                absolutely horrible at keeping track of                                time so Ted if you can make sure are you                                staying yeah if you can make sure that                                there's a chunk of time left at the end                                give me a five-minute morning okay oh                                but I need something like                                              make sure that we have time to get into                                discussion depending on the shape of it                                I Michael all right before i start i                                would just like to hear back from people                                in the room how many of you have                                actually been actively involved in an                                open source project hands please okay                                how many of those were Apache projects                                smaller number than usual okay i'm going                                to give you a little bit of my own                                background before i start the talk i am                                actually not a computer scientist i'm                                not a data scientist i'm not a computer                                engineer and in fact I don't even play                                one on television my original training                                is technical my background is as a                                research biochemist and molecular                                biologist so this has been a real                                interesting a switch to step into this                                community I do a fair amount of writing                                about Big Data projects and open source                                projects and the open source projects                                that I'm familiar with our Apache                                foundation projects and they have their                                own style certainly there are many other                                open source projects that are shaped                                differently than this I don't have a lot                                of experience with us all want to hear                                back from you and the examples that I'll                                be giving you in terms of the tips that                                I have to offer a really based on the                                open source of patching projects that                                that I've been involved with so let's                                get started so I've heard a lot of                                people think that the most important                                thing in any kind of open source                                computer project is                                the code the developers and writing the                                code the code itself is what really                                matters but in fact for myself I                                actually do too if you don't have a                                project you don't have computer codes                                you don't have a project so it is the                                most important thing but it's certainly                                not the only thing and what we want to                                look at is without a strong community                                around the project the code itself may                                not have the life and an energy that you                                want it may not reach the users that you                                want and it may not take the shape that                                you want if you're involved in the                                project so I'm going to talk about this                                a little bit at the beginning from the                                point of view of people who are                                basically the core developers in a                                project what their needs are and you                                know what makes it a strong project for                                them and then what can get wrapped                                around that to make a better project and                                what people who are not the core                                developers can do whether their                                developers whether they're coders or non                                coders what they can do to be involved                                in a project in order to make it a                                stronger project so if the community is                                that important why don't all open source                                projects have a really strong community                                and many of them do and you certainly                                see that here at buzz words about some                                of them don't and that's one of the                                things we want to look at one reason is                                that some projects are not really                                intended to be a big community project                                it may be a very special or academic                                idea that somebody just wants the                                freedom to work on they'd like to share                                that a little bit with the public you                                know get some good feedback on it and                                they're not trying to build a huge                                project that goes out and it affects a                                lot of people and those are really cool                                and then and some of those have an                                unexpected a large impact anyway but                                unless familiar with those projects so                                 those aren't the kind of projects under                                 you talking about today mostly going to                                 talk to you about the projects as I said                                 some of these Apache projects that are                                 started and run with the intention of                                 involving a large community and                                 ultimately having a project that goes                                 out and gets used by a lot of people so                                 what is it like to actually work on a                                 source project you get involved with                                 a very bright people the people are                                 living in different places and each have                                 a lot of good ideas and generally they                                 don't have enough time to actually carry                                 out the project so that's always a                                 challenge so in a lot of ways it's like                                 herding cats you have a lot of people                                 different ideas different places how do                                 you get them coordinated how do you get                                 them doing the right thing and so I'll                                 just remind you what herding cats is                                 like and if you have a chance to look up                                 this video later you'll have a lot of                                 fun with it so what actually fuels an                                 open source project what's me what makes                                 people want to jump in and spend their                                 time and energy doing this I think the                                 answer is pretty clear it's generally                                 pizza okay but seriously what is it                                 really that fuels the open source                                 projects and on my observation is it's                                 also beer so looking at Apache                                 foundation this is a quote from the                                 Apache foundation main page an open                                 source project under their umbrella is                                 not simply the code it's not simply the                                 the development of the software itself                                 but it's actually a community of                                 developers and of users and I think                                 certainly among a bunch of people who                                 are very technical who are the ones who                                 are really at the center of the core of                                 developing a project it's sometimes easy                                 to forget that the users are also a part                                 of that community and a part of the                                 project especially if you're developing                                 project that you want to have legs and                                 really go out and have a large impact                                 I'm sorry I'm staring at this to                                 remember what is on here but I've done                                 something odd with my monitor and I                                 actually can't see what slides on                                 displaying so keep steering up here                                 really can think of the project as                                 having different phases in the early                                 stages of development the challenges are                                 getting people involved getting enough                                 people involved getting the right people                                 involved shaping the project and moving                                 it forward to maturity but then again                                 for these projects when people really do                                 want to have a lot of other people                                 involved is actually deploying the                                 project                                 having it out there and being used and I                                 think for some people at the point that                                 the final release is made sometimes                                 they're interested in the project sort                                 of lags off or indeed the time they may                                 have and to be involved in it but in a                                 way it's a really interesting part of                                 the phase of the project because now you                                 get to see what can be done with it                                 who's using it and and how that can come                                 back to the development of the project                                 itself so those two phases are                                 interwoven and one of the challenges                                 throughout any of these open source                                 projects is how do you keep people's                                 involvement their energy their their                                 time and their willingness to stick with                                 the project over time or indeed them to                                 bring in new people as some people                                 really are going to leave a project so                                 that the project has longevity and                                 that's a problem or challenge during the                                 development phase and it's also a                                 challenge after it's really being                                 actively used probably you're familiar                                 with a lot of the patchy foundation                                 projects i didn't put drill up here but                                 that's a new project and also one that                                 i've been interested in these are some                                 of the ones that know a little bit about

here on the                                 front that you may know do you stand up                                 for a minute so this is Isabel dressed                                 and she's part of the reason that all of                                 us are here so in a way she's involved                                 in every open source project him and in                                 buzz words because she's one of the                                 founders of buzz words but she is also a                                 founder and and commit her for the                                 Apache mahout beheld yeah okay yeah my                                 name is filled hi and I'm contributing                                 to this conference in a way that is very                                 non-technical so I'm just providing                                 images so i guess that is another                                 approach on how to contribute to the                                 community and in a big approach a good                                 very good contribution okay let's move                                 on so looking from the point of view if                                 our focus is what are the core                                 developers need they're trying to build                                 a code they want it to be good they want                                 it to be strong they need a lot of extra                                 helping hands with that so as if we                                 think of ourselves now some of you are                                 those people but pretend you're not if                                 you look from the other point of view                                 for everybody out there whether they're                                 a coder or a non coder the question                                 comes what could the rest of us do that                                 help support the the core development                                 part of the project so what can we                                 actually do and these are some of the                                 thoughts that i had about it people who                                 have the skills can review patches                                 people who have enough technical                                 knowledge and some good writing skills                                 can start to write documentation                                 probably not the most fun thing in the                                 world it's incredibly important part of                                 a project people can provide use cases                                 and test out use cases as the projects                                 being developed and give feedback to the                                 project they can refer other engineers                                 so maybe they don't have exactly the                                 right skill set for the project or maybe                                 they do but they don't have the time to                                 be involved but if they take an interest                                 in a project keep track of what's going                                 on and as they run into colleagues who                                 may be able to contribute giving                                 referrals can be a really great help to                                 the core development and they can get                                 the word out about the project itself                                 through a ver                                 different ways one of the things that I                                 found is really useful as people start                                 to express an interest and an open                                 source project one of the first things                                 that I suggest if it's in early stages                                 of development like Apache drill that                                 they consider subscribing to the mailing                                 list for the developer mailing list if                                 it's a more mature project like Apache                                 mahout and some of the other project I                                 suggest that they go to the developer                                 side but that's what they're interested                                 in or in some of those projects there's                                 more activity actually on the user's                                 side because that's you know where the                                 project is at that point but it finally                                 occurred to me and after trying this                                 myself subscribing to several of these                                 projects to see what's going on for me                                 my email box was just completely                                 overwhelmed by the stream of emails                                 coming in relative to the project most                                 of which because of my background are                                 too technical for me to get a lot of use                                 out of I'm not looking at it every day                                 I'm not acting on it every day I found a                                 little bit overwhelming so I thought wow                                 that and advising people to do this and                                 in fact I'm not sure I want to do it                                 myself so what I do instead and I'll                                 take the Apache drill project as a good                                 example every several days I look at the                                 development mailing list that's a new                                 project so right now it's the developer                                 list that's active the user list has you                                 know almost nothing on it yet but                                 instead of subscribing to that list                                 although i think i am still subscribed                                 but I hide everything I just jump under                                 the website I go on to the thread for                                 that month jump back and forth for one                                 month's to another and it's a wonderful                                 way to be able to take just a few                                 minutes scan down the list of what the                                 conversational topics are look over and                                 see who's involved and you immediately                                 get a sense of where the projects going                                 and if there's a piece of that that's a                                 particular interest to you or again if                                 you have the the coding skills and want                                 to get involved you can see if there's                                 something that you want to jump in on                                 and so I think it's a really good way to                                 keep track of a project or indeed                                 multiple projects without being                                 overwhelmed by them various ways of                                 getting the word out to different people                                 and getting a conversation going and                                 join in the conversation yourself or at                                 least watching it go by the social media                                 that I enjoy using is Twitter which I                                 came in to accidentally because I was                                 going over to have dinner at the house                                 of of Michael Bush who works at Twitter                                 and so friend and I thought wow I'm                                 going over to see Michael again and I've                                 never even looked at twitter so I'll                                 just sign up this little account for fun                                 and you know maybe I'll write poetry or                                 send jokes or something but I also                                 started commenting on what was happening                                 with mahout and some of the other open                                 source projects and some other big data                                 involvement with the company called map                                 are and the talks that were being given                                 and suddenly that took over my Twitter                                 account and so that's pretty much what I                                 use it for at this point and it's been a                                 lot of fun so i recommend whatever                                 social media that you like it's a nice                                 way to keep it's a different style of                                 seeing what's going on with the project                                 then with actually following the mailing                                 list itself okay so as for developers                                 we've looked at what other people can do                                 to help that project and so the next                                 question comes what can the developers                                 themselves do to help the project go                                 forward and a lot of overlap but                                 probably you've probably all heard this                                 but I think it is really important                                 especially as the experts on the project                                 and the people who really have the                                 leadership and the voice it's important                                 to play nice doesn't mean you don't                                 express strong opinions and it doesn't                                 mean that you take in everybody's idea                                 and that every piece of code anybody                                 offers you is is the right code or a                                 good code for the project but how you                                 deal with those situations really makes                                 a big difference in people's enthusiasm                                 to join it and keep going and never                                 never on a mailing list especially or in                                 person but especially not on a mailing                                 list never be rude and one tip I can                                 give you is that email isn't the same as                                 direct communication as useful as it is                                 a lot of these projects are being done                                 by people who are in very different                                 parts of the world they have to rely on                                 things like email to keep the                                 communication going and with email you                                 don't have the new ins you don't see a                                 person's expression you don't know if                                 they're being slightly sarcastic or                                 funny or serious or indeed they intended                                 to be rude so just to be a little                                 careful about those communications if                                 you're one of the people actively                                 involved in these projects and I think                                 it makes things go much better a lot of                                 the rest of this is pretty obvious but                                 the second one is second the third point                                 here it's really important if you have                                 the opportunity especially at a venue                                 like this to to pair up the experience                                 of working on a project remotely through                                 google hangout through WebEx through                                 mailing lists discussions but when you                                 have the opportunity to have different                                 people are on the same project in the                                 same place take that opportunity and so                                 I'll give you the example of one that I                                 know of on the Apache mahout project                                 they're about to come out with a new                                 release and a lot of the people came                                 here one day earlier than buzz words                                 took advantage of the fact that there                                 would be a number of the core developers                                 here in Berlin at the same time and                                 that's one of the beauties of a                                 conference like buzzards it does bring                                 in selling people who are at the heart                                 of these projects together and they                                 spent an enormous number of hours over                                 the weekend in just a huge flurry of                                 activity squashing bugs left and right                                 and getting the project ready to go and                                 obviously they've been doing that anyway                                 but it is very different to have all of                                 this people in the room together it's                                 just a different kind of interaction so                                 I think pairing that up is a very                                 powerful thing having said how powerful                                 it is to have those meetings face to                                 face when you have the opportunity is if                                 you're involved in that do keep in mind                                 it's important then to take the time to                                 go back and report it back online for                                 people who weren't in the room at the                                 time it's good for them to hear what                                 those discussions were not just to see                                 the end result I think the rest of this                                 is pretty obvious but back to the idea                                 of documentation it takes time and                                 energy to have to sit down with the                                 person who's doing the documentation                                 especially if they're not as technically                                 expert as you are and that's probably in                                 some ways less appealing than just                                 working on the core of the project but                                 the end result is an important impact on                                 the project if you want good                                 documentation if you want people to                                 understand your project and be able to                                 use it that time that you invest working                                 with the people who are willing to give                                 their time to do documentation makes a                                 big difference and the alternative is                                 you're stuck with writing all of that                                 yourself and that's probably also not                                 that appealing so taking the time for                                 that pays off in the long run                                 what we do on the user side to build the                                 user side of the community again a lot                                 of overlap with the things that we just                                 said they're not completely separated                                 but now the project is in a different                                 kind of phase a different space and as                                 the public or indeed as core developers                                 on one project you may be the users of a                                 different project and so one of the best                                 things you can do to help a project is                                 to actually use its product use it but                                 don't just use it use it and get the                                 information back to the people in the                                 project so they know how things are                                 going they know what needs to be changed                                 or not and also get the information out                                 to other people who might want to use                                 this it's amazing how many people really                                 don't know about the project's get very                                 excited when they do hear about it and                                 that can make a big difference in also                                 goes back to the development itself and                                 give you a so what can we do to help                                 this is a great example back in I                                 December I think it was this year they                                 patching the hoot project got a huge                                 shot in arm because there was a very                                 well publicized article and wired about                                 how the company overstock.com had saved                                 millions of dollars by making a                                 recommender that involved a hoot                                 recommender one of the people who put                                 the star to say the bug in there I guess                                 you don't say that in computer turns the                                 the person who helped plant that idea of                                 how they might do that is sitting here                                 with his legs propped up Ted Dunning and                                 because it ended up I mean the project                                 happened and that was great it was a                                 great for overstock com but because that                                 wired article appeared it really called                                 attention to mahout for a lot of other                                 people now i watch what happens on                                 basically in social media via Twitter                                 sometimes in the comments I'm making                                 about big data not just about them who'd                                 project I'll be reporting somebody's                                 blog post or a link to a meeting site or                                 something like that and say what                                 hashtags would be useful for that                                 particular post and say two years ago                                 year and a half ago I would be saying                                 something about this topic in general                                 and I would try the hashtag analytics                                 and there would be enough hits it got to                                 the point if you mentioned                                 the hashtag Hadoop there were so many                                 hits that you could do anything with it                                 so that wasn't really useful and I could                                 put in the hashtag machine learning and                                 there was nothing so it wasn't very                                 helpful because nobody was searching for                                 that data mining yes not machine                                 learning after this article came out I                                 can put in the hashtag machine learning                                 and you get a lot of people who are                                 tweeting about that so you just start to                                 see that the public awareness you know                                 begins to change there have been a lot                                 of people requesting talks I hope a MAF                                 our line up some of their speakers with                                 meetups and a lot of people are asking                                 for talks in the hood so suddenly                                 there's just this renewed interest in                                 the project it's really been exciting to                                 see that effect and that's getting fed                                 back into development he very kindly                                 held up the sign for                                                     don't think I got Ted's a signal for                                    minutes so let's just race through the                                 rest of this I companies are part of the                                 users what can they provide obviously                                 encourage people to be involved in                                 projects they can also provide venue                                 where people can have meetups to discuss                                 the project or have hackathons very                                 important aspect of these projects they                                 can also provide the beer and pizza key                                 aspect can you do to help again a lot of                                 overlap with the sorts of things we've                                 already talked about this is a reminder                                 that we want to give away a few books                                 here so we have a quick little contest                                 who out here would not like to have a                                 copy of mahout in action raise your hand                                 okay all right so if you don't want to                                 copy my next question is did you get one                                 of these little cards that was handed
