Publication date: 2013-06-19
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2013 #bbuzz
Description: 
	We've had talks about how ElasticSearch can scale search and analytics to hundreds of nodes and terrabytes of data. We know it is up to the job, big or small. The question now is: How do I use it? How do I go from a list of requirements to a functioning performant application?

This talk will take you from the beginning -- how to get your data into ElasticSearch -- through the process of tweaking the schema to support your search requirements. We will talk about how to construct complex queries using the query DSL, and the tools available for understanding search results. Finally, we will talk about using facets and suggesters to help your users navigate your data.

By the end of the talk, you should have a solid understanding of the tools available to you in Elasticsearch.
