Some points of interest will include data partitioning and ownership (shards), data replication, self-healing (anti-entropy), and distributed querying. Ryan is the creator of Yokozuna. The project is only 10 months old but Ryan strongly believes it will be the future of search in Riak. Come here him speak if you interested in distributed search.
