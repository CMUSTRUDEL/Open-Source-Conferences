Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2013: Michael Kaisser - Geospatial Event Detection in the Twitter Stream #bbuzz
Publication date: 2013-06-19
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2013 #bbuzz
Description: 
	The rise of Social Media in the last years has created huge streams of information that can be very valuable in a variety of scenarios. However, what precisely these scenarios are and how the data streams can efficiently be analyzed for each scenario is still largely unclear.

In this talk, we present a system for geo-spatial event detection on Social Media streams. It monitors all posts on Twitter issued in a given geographic region, store them in MongoDB and uses a spatial index to identify places that show a high amount of activity. In a second processing step, we analyze the resulting spatio-temporal clusters of posts with a Machine Learning component in order to detect whether they constitute real-world events or not. 

In our experiments, we focus on the New York metropolitan area and we detect events as diverse as house fires, on-going baseball games, parties, traffic jams, Broadway premiers, conferences, tech gatherings and demonstrations.

	                              okay can you give me yes                               welcome to this talk                               about geo vation geospatial event                               detection - Twitter stream you will find                               out what exactly I mean by that during                               the talk it's probably a bit different                               from from other talks I mean it's also                               not about it elasticsearch like the talk                               before it's not even about Hadoop but                                it's about social media analytics and                                there's an awful lot of data out there                                that need to be analyzed and you need                                quite a bit of intelligent methods to do                                that because it's textual data and so on                                and so forth and I'm just going to give                                an example about how we do this and I                                hope you can take something away from                                that so it's a very specific scenario                                that we're focusing here it's about a                                command and control center I'm going to                                tell you in a second what that is we                                have a certain approach of how we deal                                with this first of all we try to                                identify hotspots that's like certain                                spots where lots of tweets are coming                                from and then we'd use a machine                                learning approach to figure out whether                                something really something interesting                                happening there or not and I'm going to                                present some revelation results and look                                in the future ok social data so social                                media continuously creates massive                                amounts of data there                                                   each days that's about                                                 data just coming in every day as a                                constant stream and the nature of the                                data is also rather special so it's                                time-stamped first of all that's                                something you can work with and that's                                something you should work with because                                like usually people are interested what                                happened now or just like recently and                                not so much what happened like you know                                five weeks ago its textual data it has                                really many languages there all sorts of                                lingos and slang so you can't really you                                know and using a dictionary on this data                                it's very difficult because sometimes                                you you know it's just it just doesn't                                work are you have spelling mistakes a                                lot of them because just people try this                                on the go and you have only a few words                                per tweet which is also like a huge                                limitation if you for example want to                                detect the topics in a certain text like                                if you have a newspaper article anil ong                                you have like lots of chances to find                                words that can tell you what it's about                                if you have a tweet it's just like very                                short and you have very you know fewer                                chances of actually figuring out what                                it's all about it has links to pictures                                so you might want to follow these links                                so you have to take account that because                                that takes some time kind of like catch                                the HTML document                                like you know extract a picture from it                                if you want to display it you have links                                to newspaper articles which gives you                                even more text that you should work with                                and sometimes it's geospatial that means                                like in some tweets you have the exact                                coordinates from where the tweet is                                coming from and that's of course very                                valuable information as well it's about                                five five to ten percent or at least                                like you know in the innocent scenario                                that we are having and so it's not easy                                to create actionable insights from this                                data and in this talk I just want to                                give one example about how we're doing                                this and of course there are tons of                                others ok the company I work for                                it's called ATT international down here                                it's actually probably also bit                                different from like other companies you                                have around here so what they do is kind                                of like urban management and Public                                Safety and so you know I mean cities                                today are complex and they need to be                                organized and the administration is                                responsible for to keep the population                                safe there so that would be like                                emergency services firefighters the                                police department the health department                                and so on is forth they all have an                                interest in knowing what's happening                                actually what's happening right now and                                where this is happening and then you                                 have like a command and control center                                 down here this is basically you know                                 like the firefighters would have on the                                 police would have one and this is when a                                                                                                          the services get detached and dispatched                                 and so on and so forth so i am telling                                 you this why social media relevant in                                 this context well it is i mean for                                 example look at this picture this is an                                 actual tweet right there's a plane in                                 the Hudson I'm on a ferry going to pick                                 up two people crazy this was five                                 minutes on Twitter because before it was                                 anywhere else next example is this a                                 love parade I'm seeing through I'm sure                                 you're familiar with it in this mess                                 like                                                                    like it wasn't Twitter like you know the                                 description of the situation you could                                 like if you just like and then was                                 actually like three or four years ago                                 and Twitter volume was much lower than                                 but you could get a pretty good idea                                 about what was going on if you only                                 would have followed that data that's in                                 Dutch here which points out another                                 problem right you get different                                 languages and then there is this and                                 this is the what                                 actually looking for right I mean we're                                 not really looking for this very big                                 event but rather for very small scale                                 events here we have Hoboken is and fire                                 and they're so used to giving the exact                                 address and page you see saying the                                 building is burning there and believe it                                 or not a lot of times people actually                                 send out these tweets but they don't                                 call the fire fighters right it was also                                 when this this when they saw the soldier                                 was killed in London recently that was                                 also a case in point like there was a                                 picture on Twitter very early on about                                 like the police basically arresting or                                 shooting or they just had shot the two                                 guys and they were like lying on the                                 floor and they were arresting them now                                 and the picture was on Twitter very                                 early on there was no other picture of                                 this and if you look at the Twitter                                 stream of the guy who posted it you can                                 see like immediately after the picture                                 it's all the news agency can we use this                                 picture can we use this picture can you                                 tell us more can you tell us more what                                 is the situation and so on and so forth                                 and that is basically what we want to do                                 you want to filter out these information                                 and kind of make it accessible to                                 whoever the customer is you know                                 firefighter ambulance police and so on                                 so forth and the technical term for this                                 is that creating a situational awareness                                 picture so that's basically when we do                                 I'm not going to tell you all of that                                 I'm just gonna focus on the first thing                                 here so we want to automatically detect                                 whether something is happening there                                 that we think like our customers should                                 know about we want to detect this we                                 want to classify it and then display                                 these events and operator in the command                                 and control center                                 it could be accident fire scenes of                                 violence demonstrations and so on and so                                 forth here's a little example of how                                 this looks I actually can show you the                                 demo here as well this is an offline                                 demo because I can't connect to the                                 servers                                 if you look at this this is a map of New                                 York we're doing these experiments                                 between New York just because there's um                                 an awful lot of tweets from New York                                 though that makes it easier to develop                                 it then of course like you know if the                                 customer is some Wells you need to                                 report it for example here you can see                                 here's the fire that has been detected                                 it's at the world trend straight Center                                 memorial site and then you can actually                                 look at a picture you just don't see                                 much because there's like smoke here I                                 think this is better example behind here                                 it's another fire and there you have a                                 picture which you know you can pretty                                 easily see what the situation is all                                 about right I mean people are in this                                 building and they have to leave this                                 building because it's being evacuated                                 and the alarms went off and so on so                                 forth so people are share share this on                                 Twitter and that's what we want to find                                 and of course like while we're doing                                 this and in a way we're doing this we're                                 finding lots of other stuff as well                                 which is potentially interesting to                                 people but not exactly in this scenario                                 look at this I mean here's just like a                                 music event there's like the Rolling                                 Stones playing I think and has tons and                                 tons of pictures out there exactly from                                 this location there's a certain data                                 gathering up here people are talking                                 about to dupe we would probably find                                 this Avengers let's you know this is                                 some some some sport game and there's                                 another kind of like a pitching                                 competition from startups and you can                                 see the winners here on stage maybe                                 that's the other picture and so on and                                 so forth right so that's basically the                                 stuff that you can find I mean for for                                 the company that I work for it's mostly                                 these you know I mean what if something                                 goes wrong if there's a traffic accident                                 if there's a fire and so on and so forth                                 what's interesting                                 so I mean these are the slides that I've                                 just shown you and the demo actually so                                 what I'm going to talk to you about                                 dennis is how we actually do this and we                                 have a two-step approach here the first                                 is we identify a location that has a                                 high activity of tweets and we collect                                 certain geospatial tweet clusters gonna                                 tell you in a second how that works                                 then we evaluate a cluster with the                                 machine learning approach so we want to                                 figure out like is this actually real of                                 something that we found here and what is                                 it that we found actually what we have                                 found is kind of like what we're working                                 on in a moment that is kind of like                                 classifying the events according to the                                 type because you want to know you know                                 is this a rock concert or is this a                                 building that's on fire because that's                                 you know different people are interested                                 in that so as I said I mean they're like                                 tweets that contain coordinates and in                                 the first stage here I mean basically we                                 were but we could work with those and so                                 you know they come in each yellow dot                                 here is a tweet and so you know they                                 come in we store them in MongoDB and                                 kind of build up a geospatial index and                                 for each tweet that comes in we would                                 look are there like more tweets around                                 it and here actually you found something                                 so it would kind of like look oh we have                                 like three tweets from this location so                                 we kind of like store that                                 here's another goes on then and if                                 something new falls in this radius we                                 kind of like add it to the old cluster                                 here it's slightly outside but we still                                 add it because we kind of think that                                 might be the same thing so I mean that                                 is what we're basically doing in this                                 first step this is done stored in                                 MongoDB and I saw some geospatial                                 indexing and it basically allows us to                                 to do this search pretty effectively and                                 efficiently and at that point we haven't                                 really figured out much we just know                                 that this - there are these two hotspots                                 and then at that point with then we need                                 to look into the the data itself and you                                 can see that there is like this is one                                 of the clusters we found and this is                                 another cluster and you can see this                                 here is clearly something that we're                                 interested in why this is not right I                                 mean this and the difference here is                                 mostly that these tweets are about the                                 same topic whereas the tweets are about                                 a different topic all right you can see                                 that it's more about like I'll play                                 playing the try                                 and then somebody is saying that he                                 wants to do some chopped apps and kind                                 of like you know something about the                                 Emmys and so on this is completely                                 unrelated and this is just like people                                 making first hands episode observations                                 and reporting them so what we want what                                 we need to do then is basically we need                                 to figure out that this is good and that                                 this is bad and that looks like a                                 plastic machine learning problem so yeah                                 we use machine learning to this to                                 distinguish these two and I will talk it                                 tell you in a second how exactly that                                 works just like here's a bit of the                                 architecture that we use social media                                 platforms who have an API and then                                 that's coming into our system they                                 currently only run this on Twitter                                 because Twitter data is there's a lot of                                 it and it's freely available and Twitter                                 is actually really happy if people use                                 their API you know you know Facebook is                                 always kind of like the thing I mean you                                 know if you post something on Twitter                                 basically everybody knows that they're                                 sharing this with the whole world and so                                 it's kind of like fine to use it but if                                 you're Facebook then you know you can                                 get the Facebook messages but most                                 people just set the privacy settings                                 wrong so you get all that stuff that                                 you're not supposed to get and that is a                                 bit that's a bit awkward and so you know                                 I mean just using Twitter is the better                                 way here the data made retrieval module                                 which is like fetches the tweets you put                                 them in a queue just show that we can                                 deal because sometimes the things with                                 Twitter they don't come continuously but                                 they come you know there's nothing for a                                 few seconds and then you get a huge                                 batch it's not supposed to be that way                                 but that's what happens and so it goes                                 in a queue and if it comes out of the                                 queue we pre prosit it and then we store                                 it in in MongoDB we have three tables                                 here post event candidate events post is                                 just every post that we get we store it                                 and keep it for                                                         its released so that the database                                 doesn't get too full                                 there's the cluster create it's just                                 what I've shown you and a cluster update                                 or two chops that basically try to                                 figure out other tweets coming from a                                 certain location and are there a lot of                                 them if we find that that makes up an                                 event candidate and then we have a                                 cluster score                                 which I'm gonna show you in a second                                 that's the machine learning part which                                 runs over each event candidate and if it                                 kind of like returns a good enough score                                 we put it in the event table and                                 everything that is an event table then                                 can be displayed to intone to a user                                 either in the web GUI that we have here                                 or like in this command control center                                 and you know that's the data                                 visualization so when that's about the                                 machine learning one second as I said we                                 have to treat clusters this is one                                 example here and then these are all the                                 features that are computed on those                                 because I mean now we want to do the                                 real intelligence you want to figure out                                 like is this you know is it good or is                                 it not good and the first feature that                                 we use here is kind of like common theme                                 and it basically will just calculate an                                 Engram overlap between the different                                 tweets in the cluster so we have                                 suspicious packet suspicious package                                 here we have like five fear four five                                 six of cure several times because that's                                 the Train unfortunately you can see that                                 it's also a bit of a mess because you                                 never actually have that exact string                                 because here you have four five six                                 hashtag four five six hashtag four five                                 six train so you need to do some you                                 know I mean you need to turn the                                 tokenization needs to be fairly                                 intelligent but nevertheless it can be                                 done                                 so this first feature would just look at                                 trying to figure out whether their words                                 or phrases that are used in all tweets                                 and that's a good thing right                                 and yeah so the next feature is about                                 duplicates duplicates are usually not                                 good because if this there might be                                 retweets or any other thought of like                                 people passing on one tweet and just                                 like you know forwarding it maybe                                 sometimes to reach registers missing                                 so if doubly kids then basically it's                                 not a first hand observation it's just                                 like somebody you know just passing                                 something on that's maybe not what we                                 want especially if you have a tweet                                 cluster where everything is exactly the                                 same right we have a bunch of sentiment                                 features which are fairly simple with                                 just if dictionaries about words that                                 are positive and words that are usually                                 about negative emotions                                 emoticons are in there they usually help                                 actually the words it's a bit difficult                                 and we just would look you know that's                                 justice                                 this cluster overall contain more                                 positive words and negative words more                                 negative words and positive words and so                                 on and so forth                                 that might be important because you know                                 if you have an event like a rock concert                                 you can expect people to be rather                                 positive about it if there's a fire                                 probably they're rather negative about                                 it and oh my god and horrible and so on                                 and so forth so that helps to figure out                                 what event you're dealing with                                 subjectivity is more like an experiment                                 to figure out you know whether people                                 are talking about something that                                 happened to them or something about                                 general just are they're just forwarding                                 a newspaper article so here we'll look                                 for personal pronouns you know I am you                                 know doing something and what and so on                                 so forth present tense goes in the same                                 direction this is about you know verbs                                 in the present tense reporting that                                 people are experienced something right                                 now that is here rather than yesterday I                                 did you know that would be not what we                                 want and we have a bunch of ratios you                                 know we let the machine learning                                 algorithm of course figure out whether                                 they help or not like how many hashtags                                 are there in there what's the radio                                 radio of ads what's a retweet ratio and                                 we have certain semantic categories it's                                 just like dictionaries you know about                                 sport events about fires that basically                                 help the machine learning algorithm to                                 kind of like figure out what type of                                 event it is and also whether it's an                                 event or not at all yeah and these are                                 all basically working on the text and                                 they're just like certain other features                                 we have here just a link ratio how many                                 links are actually in there we can                                 figure out whether something is from                                 Foursquare or not just but because for                                 Foursquare tweets have a certain                                 structure they're always like I am and                                 you know things like that                                 and of course if something's from                                 Foursquare that also indicates certain                                 categories and others probably not                                 because people wouldn't check in at the                                 car accident right that's not what you                                 do usually what you might again at a                                 rock concert generally how many tweets                                 are there and this is also an important                                 feature as we will see from how many                                 different posters do we have them                                 actually                                 so if you have like this and this is all                                 from the same person you know that                                 that's good but I mean if this comes                                 from four different person to basically                                 have four persons that are at this                                 location they're all reporting the same                                 thing that is pretty good evidence that                                 something really is happening there and                                 you get lots of like of these things                                 from all from the same person is                                 somebody sitting somewhere tweeting and                                 reporting every five minutes about his                                 his lunch right all it's not terribly                                 interesting for us unique coordinates is                                 to sort out BOTS if this would come in                                 and all the the coordinates are slightly                                 different from each other then that's a                                 good indication that people are really                                 using their mobile phones because                                 they're not really                                                       coordinates are exactly the same and                                 probably that's just a robot tweeting                                 and it's hard-coded to code code from                                 the to send this out from these                                 coordinates not what we want and we have                                 some special occasions because we know                                 that you know people tweet usually when                                 they're bored and they're bored when                                 they go to the train station or whenever                                 at the airport they just go there they                                 start waiting and they would start take                                 out their Twitter and kind of like read                                 through it and retweet it and so from                                 train stations and airports we would get                                 like lots and lots of tweets so we have                                 to take this into account just like                                 because there's not always something                                 happening there if people are tweeting a                                 lot okay so that is basically all the                                 intelligence it runs on the clusters and                                 yeah we use a machine learning setup for                                 this and the thing here is basically                                 what we're using is that cow right so                                 we're car force all of you sort of you                                 who know it doesn't scale it doesn't                                 scale at all nevertheless it works for                                 us and here's just why machine learning                                 or traditional offline machine learning                                 Falls basically in two phases right we                                 have a training face this is when we                                 chew through all the data and when we                                 basically create a predictive model that                                 is like the blue part here and then like                                 during execution we have like the green                                 part here that is you know during                                 runtime and everything that is done is                                 kind of like applying the predictive                                 model the predictive model can be very                                 simple and so if we train we have                                 like you know quite a bit of time                                 available to us so we can use back                                 although it's not really great and fast                                 and scalable and but that's okay we just                                 like set a few you know some time for it                                 aside it will create a model and we just                                 have to run the model during execution                                 and then we use issues and fees so that                                 would be the output effect that you get                                 after you run it for a while and then                                 what you can do is just like you can                                 take this decision tree and pour it into                                 the language of your choice                                 alright this here is c-sharp company                                 likes to use C sharp and you know I mean                                 this is a direct translation of the                                 decision tree and that is nothing else                                 that is happening here these are all the                                 features and then we have calculated                                 certain waits for the features and it's                                 for example so says if this unique                                 postage total feature is below a certain                                 threshold then return false so it's not                                 an event and don't even bother to go                                 further and you know their other party                                 where it gets more complicated and as                                 you can see here this code is only this                                 upper part and you know I mean it gets                                 it gets rather complicated so this can                                 get quite long that of course is not not                                 all that you can optimize out of it                                 there is a nice paper out there by Jimmy                                 Lin who is coming directly from Twitter                                 they use this approach a lot and what                                 you can then do is kind of like you know                                 wrong run all sorts of optimizations                                 over it and even go to the compiler and                                 you know because the compiler tries to                                 optimize such code and especially kind                                 of like winners coming from machine                                 learning kind of like know which pass                                 the compiler is likely to take but the                                 compiler makes its own assumptions and                                 sometimes they're wrong so you can help                                 the compiler with certain settings                                 they're kind of like you know what -                                 what to load in and what to to store and                                 to cache and whatnot it's fairly new                                 paper from Twitter so if you're                                 interested in that you know it's a good                                 read okay so this training that we did                                 this is also like of course a reason why                                 Weka works for us very well                                 it's because we only had                                               labeled tweet clusters so basically what                                 you need to do for each of these                                 clusters you need in or                                 for a set of these clusters for each one                                 you need to know whether it's good or                                 whether it's bad and that needs to come                                 from somewhere so somebody has to look                                 at it manually and say you know it's                                 good or it's bad and so on and so forth                                 and we did this with                                                     if you want to have it larger you would                                 go to Mechanical Turk or use some online                                 approach I'm going to talk about that in                                 a second                                 so we did this by hand just me and a                                 colleague of mine and we got like                                        them were good and                                                       use cross-validation usually that's just                                 the standard approach and if you use a                                 decision tree we get to this British                                 position and recall numbers which are                                 really very good but as we will see in a                                 second there's a problem with a recall                                 number so yeah what we then also can do                                 this is also nice we actually can take a                                 look at the data that we have and we can                                 see which of the features that we                                 actually set up which of them does work                                 and which of them do not work and yeah                                 that way you know I mean just basically                                 figure out what works and what doesn't                                 which is always good to know and this is                                 basically the outcome then I talked                                 about these two features earlier on we                                 have this common theme that is basically                                 people using the same words in different                                 tweets and we have like unique posters                                 that is like the tweet has more than one                                 author and you know a one here is                                 basically I think it would be ten                                 different people in a tweet in a tweet                                 cluster and comma theme up here with                                 like three words that really frequently                                 are cure so this is just like a formula                                 behind there and what you can see very                                 clearly is that if we have lots of                                 different people posting from the same                                 location that never less use the same                                 words then we're up up there in that                                 region and then that's good that's an                                 event whereas if these two conditions                                 don't hold usually it's not an event and                                 these are also like the two features                                 here that really helped a lot and the                                 rest is kind of like you know it's                                 behind so yeah someone somewhat                                 simplified summary of what I've told you                                 so far so if there are several tweets                                 there are roughly from the same location                                 issued of roughly the same time from                                 different users but that they never less                                 use the same words and we can be fairly                                 sure that something is happening there                                 okay first of all you know we're by no                                 means finished with this I mean there's                                 lots of stuff where it doesn't work and                                 that's just something that I want to go                                 over because it just you know otherwise                                 I think it wouldn't be right                                 we're working with coordinates and about                                 like so what we do in the first place is                                 we set up Twitter and we're just like                                 having a certain location that's in                                 downtown Manhattan and we query like                                    kilometers around it so there's a                                 circular area                                                          it and we get every tweet that's coming                                 in and about you know six or seven                                 percent of those have real coordinates                                 the rest has some location information                                 but they're not coordinate so there                                 could be something this is from                                      Street or it could be just like New York                                 or Manhattan or any credibility that you                                 can think of it might also be just like                                 a user setting up a location that's his                                 own home and and so we have something                                 that very frequently happen that's                                 called UN Iceland I think it's just some                                 guy I called you one else and he calls                                 his home in Iceland and he tweets a lot                                 from there so alright okay that doesn't                                 really help you because you really don't                                 know where that is from but if you if                                 you know at least it's Manhattan or it's                                 kind of like that's a part of Manhattan                                 you can use it but yeah I mean we need                                 more coordinates or we need to take in                                 more of the data to really figure out                                 like where is it coming from we don't                                 need the exact coordinates but pretty                                 much so and one thing here is that                                 pictures are being shared like every                                 third tweet contains a picture these                                 days and a lot of pictures actually have                                 coordinates so that's a huge source                                 there toponyms impose the topo name is a                                 place name right somebody's saying you                                 know I'm this is I'm at you know that in                                 that cafe at Manhattan and then you                                 basically can figure out where that                                 whether it is yeah and of course like                                 the poster don't have coordinates can                                 also be useful because if you're                                 we know that something is happening you                                 kind of like know which words are used                                 to describe it if you find on other                                 posts that are from generally from this                                 region because that is what you would                                 know then you maybe can attach them to                                 this cluster ortho you don't have                                 coordinates we need something like                                 real-time tf-idf tf-idf is probably                                 something you're familiar with real-time                                 here means that it constantly changes                                 over time there's always the latest kind                                 of like meme spreading on Twitter and                                 that might just mess up the data but                                 that meme is different of course it                                 changes a lot and you know if all of a                                 sudden you know and something happens                                 with Justin Bieber the whole whole                                 Twitter is talking about Justin Bieber                                 and then we need to know okay right                                 Justin Bieber is probably not a good                                 word to look out for right now because                                 you'll find it everywhere it's not what                                 we want                                 you know same for lots of other stuff                                 and finally like the real call numbers I                                 mentioned this earlier if we measure                                 recall here we can only measure what we                                 actually know and what we know is the                                 data that comes in the system and is                                 being processed and so once we have a                                 cluster we can use this as our data and                                 use this for evaluation but if there's                                 somebody somewhere fire and nobody takes                                 a picture of this fire then we don't                                 we'll never know that we have missed                                 this and even if like a picture of this                                 fire is taken and shared on Twitter and                                 we miss it we never even like take it                                 into consideration right then we also                                 kind of like miss it and we cannot                                 really discount it from the recall                                 number which we should do so recall                                 number about like you know                                             too high so there is quite a bit of work                                 to do us for for us there yes there is                                 just like a bit more stuff that that                                 we're currently being do I don't want to                                 share with you like training getting                                 training data is always like important                                 when you do machine learning of course                                 getting good training data in that case                                 we don't have the training data because                                 I mean if you work on your network locks                                 or whatever you might just like can                                 single out certain instances and say                                 this is good and this is bad we can't do                                 this we have to have somebody looking at                                 it and telling it to us and what we do                                 we did this manually we can go out to                                 Mechanical Turk of                                 course but you can also think about like                                 an online machine learning model right                                 that it's just like where you have like                                 the user sitting here that might be a c                                  operator or also journalist who's just                                 like interested in what's happening                                 around him and whenever you kind of like                                 surface this stuff to people they they                                 interact with it and automate and                                 basically tell you whether it's this was                                 something they're interested in or not                                 right I mean they might just like have                                 this open for a while and kind of like                                 click on the links and kind of like do                                 follow up actions with it all is it just                                 this is good or they might just click it                                 away this is like something that you                                 have in search engines like of course                                 all the time right I mean do do use a                                 stay on if after they click on a young                                 link do use a stay on that page right or                                 do they just come back to the search                                 engine again and anyhow which links are                                 clicked that sort of stuff so that's                                 something that we're looking into and                                 then of course there is a massive                                 massive other source in in Twitter that                                 you should not just like overlooked and                                 these are kind of like images like as I                                 said like a third of all tweets have                                 images and sometimes you have a tweet                                 like this this doesn't tell you anything                                 about what's happening here is just                                 somebody saying oh my god and then kind                                 of like sharing a link you have to look                                 at the picture to kind of like see                                 what's happening so if you can do some                                 image image analysis then we would be                                 able to work with more tweets so I think                                 I'm still have a lot of time actually so                                 I can show you this as well first of all                                 this is something different now but it's                                 just like another use case that we're                                 currently exploring and another just                                 like nice showcase I think of what it                                 can do with all this data that is out                                 there in various ways and this is as I                                 said we do the experiments on the New                                 York metropolitan area and so like                                 everything in that we get from Twitter                                 we basically yeah we would also have it                                 like far far for analysis and here                                 that's more like one years of New York                                 City tweets and so that's                                           tweets and it's more than one terabyte                                 of raw data and then what we just did is                                 we we wrote a little script it just goes                                 over it and tries                                 to figure out like which of these tweets                                 are related to traffic right and each of                                 these tweet is basically a user                                 complaining about the traffic situation                                 so that's a map of New York Road rates                                 what you have here and then we have a                                 nice little tool that actually lets you                                 whistle or visualize this that will of                                 course like then if you break it down                                 and just like only extract the tweets                                 that are about traffic you get to                                 something like I don't know the exact                                 number now I mean it was like I don't                                 know                                                                    that had coordinates and are about                                 traffic problems and that's a lot of                                 data and that basically is transformed                                 into a heat map here but you can imagine                                 that it's kind of like that you need a                                 beefy machine to kind of like do this                                 real-time computation in heat maps hear                                 what is happening and so I can just like                                 show you video of this thing so that's                                 just like all the tweets mapped where                                 people complain about traffic and he                                 will go to mean in a second and you can                                 clearly see I mean you can see the roads                                 and if it zooming closer you can kind of                                 like see that there are certainly some                                 roads which are like heavily effected by                                 traffic problems and other or not and                                 you know up here this road seems to be                                 particularly bad these roads here on the                                 side are fine nope on people complaining                                 about this is Manhattan of course like                                 Manhattan is a nightmare traffic wise                                 here's a problem this seems fine and so                                 on and so forth and then with his tool                                 you can just slice and dice the data                                 yeah so that's actually fairly                                 interesting it's just like it's just                                 like tweets and people people sitting in                                 the car and being really annoyed by the                                 traffic and having the urge to share it                                 with the world and yeah if you're a                                 great it that's the outcome all right                                 fair enough                                 I think that's it for me                                 you
