Description: 
	Your first thought may be: Why would I want to talk to non-coders? Buzzwords is a developers’ conference, and most users of open source software also are developers. But there’s a huge advantage to be gained by being able to describe what you do – the capabilities and the reasonable limitations – in powerful, non-technical ways that let you communicate effectively with project managers, those with useful domain knowledge, and in the case of some open source projects, the users. 

Take the new Apache Drill offering, for example. The community of Drill users comprise widely different groups. It includes developers who will appreciate the flexibility and extensibility of Drill as they incorporate it into their own projects plus business analysts with less deep technical developer knowledge but with strong experience and serious goals analyzing big data with BI tools. It helps for those developing Drill to be able to clearly see their needs and talk about how Drill may address them. 

Describing technical work in non-technical terms does not mean “dumbing it down”. Much to the contrary, it means having sufficiently clear conceptual understanding of your own work that you can cut to the heart of the essential aspects and communicate them to people with a wide range of different background expertise. This approach is particularly useful with machine learning projects in which clear communication with business clients and domain experts about the applicability of available data sources can make or break a project.

	                              I                               I feel like I need to put on my sunglass                               it's very bright here sir okay here we                               go I'm going to talk to you today about                               how to talk to non coders let's see if I                               can advance this properly yes I work as                               consultant right now mostly consulting                               for map our technologies I also am a                               committer in the Apache mahout project                                and a contributor to Apache drill                                project I'll repeat this contact                                information at the ends you don't need                                to worry about it now and today I'm                                going to talk to you about whether there                                actually is a problem in talking between                                people who have kind of a mismatch in                                terms of their technical background and                                whether in fact that matters do we need                                to do anything to address the problem                                and if so what you might be able to do                                to make it better I'll give you a                                homework assignment and I'll supply you                                with a parrot joke not necessarily in                                that order so let's start off with the                                question of is there a problem well when                                you have a really technical person and                                they are trying to talk to an audience                                who's less technical than they are how                                does that feel well in some cases it may                                feel like they're actually talking to a                                different species there's really a                                challenge to be able to talk where                                there's a big gap in terms of                                understanding and it's a challenge it                                takes a lot of effort to overcome in                                some cases the question is what does it                                look like from the other side so when                                people see something like this for                                example if you're a machine learning                                expert if you're a data scientist you                                may be perfectly happy to see this                                because basically techies enjoyed the                                occasional blast of algorithms and code                                but what about everybody else how did                                they feel when they see that now I want                                to do a very quick survey it's a little                                hard to see out in the audience but                                let's see a show of hands how many                                people here have actually conducted                                brain surgery okay oddly enough no one                                but if you talk to a room full of brain                                surgeons you'd probably find I'm just                                guessing that most of them actually                                don't know how to program C++ in fact                                they probably couldn't even debug a Java                                program but this doesn't mean that                                they're stupid people and in fact they                                actually house in pretty technical                                knowledge and its knowledge that's a                                value but its knowledge that's kind of a                                mismatch with the technologies of most                                of people at the the conference here so                                the challenge comes when                                the two groups of people have really                                different background the question then                                arises what how do you dress up your                                message so it can go to cross to other                                people and I challenge you to say if                                what you have to say if what you work on                                is actually important it as a value your                                message actually deserves to be                                presented in a way that the audience can                                understand it instead of being lost in                                technical jargon that won't mean                                anything to the other side so you need                                to know your audience and then be able                                to understand what might convey the                                message to them so this is a bit of a                                problem but it still raises question of                                is it a problem that's important to                                solve I mean the other approaches just                                don't talk to people who don't have the                                right kind of technical skills for the                                things that you do well I don't know                                this is a little comedy video that we                                see a lot it see if you laughter is it                                anybody's actually seen this it's called                                the expert or people refer to it as                                seven red lines and so for those of you                                who haven't seen it this is an expert                                who's been called in to talk to a                                marketing team they have a new project                                and the requirements are to draw seven                                red lines each of them exactly                                perpendicular to the other and they are                                required to draw it with some with green                                ink and some with transparent ink and                                then they ask the expert can you do this                                and so I ask you can you do this and the                                 answer of course is no I would like to                                 give you some advice if you find                                 yourself in a situation where people are                                 asking requirements and the people tend                                 to be like the ones in this video my                                 best advice to you the way to approach                                 that is just run run fast get out of                                 there because they're really not going                                 to work but the good news is usually not                                 always in real life situations the                                 people that you have to work with even                                 if they have different technical skills                                 in your own are not quite as much idiots                                 as the people who are in this video so                                 that's a good news sometimes they are                                 but usually they're not and however it                                 can often feel like they are and the                                 reason for that is that there's such a                                 mismatch between the tenth of the skills                                 that you have in the skills of the                                 audience so again the question comes is                                 it worth the effort to try to go that                                 extra distance to figure out how to                                 convey what you                                 to say to people who don't know what you                                 know well I think it is worth it some                                 people who are non coders are actually                                 worth listening to for example Steve                                 Jobs actually didn't code but he had                                 some ideas that made a big difference                                 for Apple products and for the company                                 there are a lot of people who are a                                 value to listen to even though they                                 don't have your technical skills this                                 may be particularly true to your own                                 project often the people that are the                                 people who fund the work that you do                                 aren't the people who can actually                                 execute it that's why they're hiring you                                 and so being able to talk to them                                 clearly about the needs you have I mean                                 this is really an engineering question                                 what are the resources where the                                 resources that you need what are the                                 resources available what's a schedule                                 like what kind of time to market or time                                 to value are they asking for you know is                                 there a real match for one thing how do                                 you tell if you're successful how do                                 they tell if you're successful so you                                 need some kind of mutual understanding                                 of how good is good and what is good                                 look like so there are a lot of reasons                                 it's very important to be able to have a                                 real serious conversation with good                                 understanding on both sides in that                                 situation another reason that you might                                 need to talk to non coders is because                                 they have domain knowledge that's                                 important to the project you're doing so                                 taking the example of people working                                 with the Internet of Things you may be                                 perfectly happy using time series data                                 and building your very sophisticated and                                 inefficient time series database but                                 they're also can be situations in which                                 you really need to talk to people at the                                 other end of the project the ones who                                 are designing sensors choosing what                                 sensors to use deciding what measures                                 months to make deciding what they want                                 to do with those data what the ultimate                                 goals are so there's reason to have to                                 talk to people in different parts of a                                 project here is an example I want to use                                 just because I think it's incredibly                                 cool project I don't know if you've                                 heard of aadhaar but this project is                                 trying to meet the challenge of                                 producing a unique identity a                                          random number plus biometric data to                                 identify every person in India all                                     billion of them they're a little half                                 way more than halfway through the                                 project I was particularly interested in                                 it because they chose to use                                 a map are no sequel database map our DB                                 to run the authentication part of the                                 project and the reason they chose that                                 is there are very extremely requirements                                 besides a huge amount of data for it                                 authentication authentication has to be                                 done where it's available                                 twenty-four-seven very low risk low                                 latency very fast response time so it                                 has to be in milliseconds it's very                                 extreme requirements now when you look                                 at that you say why make it so extreme                                 but here's where it becomes important to                                 realize that for a project to work well                                 people at different parts of the project                                 near need to communicate if you look at                                 what the project is doing which is                                 basically trying to change a lot about                                 Society in India they're trying to make                                 a normal kind of banking transactions                                 being able to have a loan from a bank                                 being able to deliver government welfare                                 in efficient ways so that there's not                                 fraud and money being drained off                                 they're trying to deliver this to every                                 person in India including the very                                 poorest members of society and they need                                 for people to be able to do this to do                                 these transactions anywhere they are any                                 time they need to do it so anywhere                                 anytime is the requirement and that's                                 why it translates back to some very                                 specific requirements on the technical                                 side very important for different parts                                 of the project to communicate so the                                 good news is that the kinds of skills                                 that you guys have are incredibly                                 valuable and they fit it a lot of                                 different situations but what that means                                 is to work effectively and to be                                 appreciated for the value have you have                                 to be able to talk to people who have a                                 wide variety of different backgrounds I                                 think it really is worth fixing this                                 problem although it takes a lot of                                 effort to do it but the question is how                                 and so of course that means it's time                                 for a parrot joke okay a man walks into                                 a pet store and wants to buy a birthday                                 gift for his mother he sees this                                 beautiful parrot it's very expensive but                                 the parrot speaks                                                    decides it's worth it he sends it to his                                 mom he calls her up in wishes are happy                                 birthday a few days later says mom did                                 you like the parrot she says it was okay                                 it was a little bit tough he goes tough                                 you ate this parent the parent costs                                 three thousand euros it spoke                                    languages it was brilliant                                 she said well it should have said                                 something so the message here is that it                                 is important to develop a message that                                 shows off what you do at value in a way                                 that your audience whoever they may be                                 can actually see the value in what you                                 do otherwise you're selling yourself                                 short and to do that you may need to                                 adjust your style of communication so                                 there are many different ways to                                 communicate sometimes communicating                                 technical information by telling a good                                 story this is Sebastian and costas and                                 kind of the early days of fling before                                 it was called flink actually at a buzz                                 words conference pick language that                                 works pick terminology that works of                                 visuals are important diagrams can be                                 very powerful to communicate ideas and                                 to set relationships of ideas in a                                 person's mind in a way that their mind                                 can retrieve that information later                                 becomes a good foundation on which to                                 build details as well choose language                                 that's appropriate for the audience                                 sometimes alternative towards diagrams                                 have mentioned demos can be useful you                                 show someone how something works instead                                 of just describe it especially if you're                                 working with a smaller group maybe a                                 committee meeting or something having an                                 interactive discussion can be more                                 powerful than just a presentation and by                                 interactive I don't mean saying that the                                 audience does anybody have any questions                                 or saying to the audience does everybody                                 know how to do this I mean who's going                                 to be brave enough to put their hand up                                 and say no instead you initiate a                                 conversation by asking some sort of                                 leading question get them talking about                                 what they know what their ideas are that                                 reveals to you where the level of the                                 conversation need is the pieces you need                                 to fill in you also learn a lot about                                 what's important to them which in the                                 end will be important to you so building                                 this in layers by empathy I mean                                 understanding what matters to the                                 audience and respecting that enough to                                 actually deal with it can really pay off                                 now use this example Ted spoke yesterday                                 of catchy drill we're pretty interested                                 in this project                                                       just made this is a point in time where                                 people have built it now what's                                 important is to have people use it and                                 begin to hear how that works so it's                                 time to change the message instead of                                 talking a lot                                 in terms of developers and to developers                                 about the design about the engineering                                 and architecture it's hard to actually                                 start talking about what drill can do                                 and how people can use it and to start                                 to build out the community of users and                                 to understand what they're doing so in                                 that situation is still a technical                                 communication but it's a different                                 technical audience for a different                                 purpose this is just a reminder to say                                 I've talked about using diagrams but                                 whether it's a diagram or whatever it is                                 it's really important to kind of pretest                                 what you do against the naive audience                                 just to see if it's getting across the                                 idea they want this is a diagram that                                 was from a book that                                                recently called real world Hadoop it was                                 just probably wanted to make a point                                 about real-world streaming that's being                                 done on Hadoop cluster and the                                 importance of queueing the diagram was                                 originally drawn just as black and white                                 and i found that showing it to somebody                                 there were so many parts of the diagram                                 even though it was pretty simple that                                 the single message wasn't popping out                                 something is simple I don't if you can                                 see on the slide it's grayed out just                                 kind of the path through this workflow                                 that is the real the real time streaming                                 path lets people see it but still see it                                 in a context of other things so whatever                                 it is that you're trying to convey put                                 it together in a way that you think                                 works but then just you know momentarily                                 test it against somebody and see if that                                 pops out for them it's really important                                 to get to the essential concepts of what                                 you do I don't mean generalizing that's                                 not essential but refining down to the                                 the absolute most basic and most                                 important ideas this isn't always easy                                 to do because you work in a field where                                 you have to deal with a lot of details                                 so making time for yourself too good way                                 and really think about what the key                                 ideas are can matter a lot it helps you                                 be clever it helps you communicate and                                 it helps you distinguish between                                 basically solutions which people tend to                                 start talking about and what the actual                                 goals are to make sure there's not a                                 mismatch so if you have a key idea then                                 you can begin to build on that build                                 relationships add details and layers and                                 that also helps people with recall                                 people say meet people have way that's a                                 way to make things work I say meet them                                 more than halfway you can control what                                 you do go to their level of                                 understanding and                                 back to whatever are the key ideas                                 they're just a quick look one or another                                 book that we did was the first in a                                 series on practical machine learning and                                 this one trying to convey some ideas of                                 how important it is and how powerful it                                 is to use search technology to deploy a                                 recommender and we had to think about                                 how to do this with different audiences                                 because you never know who's in your                                 audience technical people non-technical                                 people we wanted to expand the                                 conversation beyond the people who                                 normally think about machine learning so                                 we tried to define down for ourselves                                 what we thought were the key ideas that                                 we wanted to convey and even there there                                 was a hierarchy so the two most                                 important ideas we wanted to convey is                                 that search technology can help you                                 build a powerful recommender in a very                                 simple way and deploy it very simply and                                 that the data that you want to look at                                 is what people do rather than just                                 ratings we made it non scary by starting                                 with a very simple story about what                                 people do and using cartoons making it                                 fun so you can think about what somebody                                 has and how that would be the basis of                                 making recommendations even something as                                 simple as a simple diagram to represent                                 the relationship between users and items                                 and log files we find that people                                 reacted to it better if you again put it                                 in the kind of cartoon style and that                                 way you can actually lead them through                                 thinking how a search document is used                                 the different fields are used for the                                 metadata how you go through basically                                 matrix algebra do these different                                 transformations from a user history                                 behavior matrix through a co-occurrence                                 matrix to finding indicators and how                                 those indicators them can very very                                 simply just add it as another feel of                                 the document so even though they can't                                 execute it they see the power in it and                                 that helps him buy into a project and                                 then maybe support it for people who                                 want who are actually going to do it the                                 last thought of our alluded to this is                                 it's important to respect people from                                 the other team if they deserve to be                                 respected but prepare yourself to                                 respective and that helps you really                                 understand what their ideas are it helps                                 you understand where they're missing the                                 point of what you're saying your                                 homework assignment is to take something                                 something very technical and very                                 important to you build one diagram write                                 a five minute present                                 something very simple thing just to                                 convey an idea and then test it out                                 against a simple / a simple person well                                 it's fine to it against a naive person                                 and see if the techniques are working                                 for you just to kind of put it into                                 action and see if you can take home some                                 of the things that I've talked about                                 today so summary the lesson it's worth                                 fixing the problem it's very important                                 to find the essential concepts and what                                 you do that's going to pay off for you                                 in a lot of ways distinguish between                                 goals and technical solutions respect                                 the other people help them see the value                                 in what you do choose an appropriate                                 style of communication for whatever the                                 audience is because you'll talk to a                                 range of people and of course have a                                 parrot joke ready if at all possible                                 we've written four of these little books                                 that have the same style that we talked                                 about Ted is right here with the Red Hat                                 we've done four in the last year so it's                                 been kind of a tiring year O'Reilly                                 sells these or if you want a free e-copy                                 map are as making them available as a                                 free download and the links to do that                                 are there Ted and I are you going to be                                 available to break ken and I are going                                 to be available at the break sitting at                                 just

  questions come and talk to us about it a                                 small and shameless plug to say please                                 support women in technology help girls
