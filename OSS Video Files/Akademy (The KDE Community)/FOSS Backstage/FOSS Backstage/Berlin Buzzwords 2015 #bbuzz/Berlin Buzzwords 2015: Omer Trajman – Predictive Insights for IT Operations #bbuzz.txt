Description: 
	Domains such as financial trading, advertising and marketing have been fertile breeding grounds for cutting edge data-driven applications. Yet the systems that power these services are still running on decades old technology. Traders can run algorithms that make millions of dollars in milliseconds but the underlying systems are still serviced by tools that provide mere searching and graphing. 

Even the most powerful IT tools only look at small fractions of data, leaving most IT professions to hunt around in the dark. In this talk we will explore the application of machine learning in the domain of IT operations. In the datacenter there are thousands of sources of event data. By modeling the datacenter as a source of multiple data streams, we can apply techniques from other domains, modified to address the environments that now power much of our economy. 

Our focus here is around correlated anomaly detection across multiple time series data sets. By filtering streams of events that deviate from previously established patterns we can surface likely correlations of these streams for further exploration and analysis. Anomalies may be surfaced by anything from simple heuristics such as a reduced count of events, reference points such as specific types of event counts crossing Bollinger bands, or by more complex techniques such as probabilistic graphical models. 

Attendees will learn how techniques used in other domains of machine learning can be applied to help IT operators keep quality of service high. Attendees should be familiar with either machine learning techniques or with IT operations and data center architecture.

	                              thank you very much                               so the                               the titles big data for IT operations my                               name is Omar chime and I'm the CEO of ro                               Khanna see give you sort of a brief                               background I got started in big data at                               a company called vertigo is now part of                               HP I ran the field team for Cloudera and                               spent a lot of this time over the past                                                                                                     who were adopting a lot of the                                technologies that you've heard about                                today really the precursors to those                                technologies early call in her storage                                early Hadoop and MapReduce in some of                                the later systems and discovered along                                the way that the challenges that people                                had were increasingly not how to adopt                                and build on the technologies the                                ecosystem has evolved the education has                                evolved conferences such as buzz words                                have provided people with the tools to                                actually build but actually taking these                                technologies and running them in data                                centers at scale for mission-critical                                deployments that's where a lot of the                                people that I've worked with struggled                                so it wasn't actually say installing                                solar or elastic or Hadoop or even you                                know if you look at TED talk just now                                about drill there's great tutorials                                about how to use it it was when you                                wanted to run it globally when you had                                five data centers and two of those are                                actually hosted cloud providers and                                you're actually trying to deploy these                                technologies this is where we saw a lot                                of people struggling because these                                technologies are fundamentally new                                they're distributed systems they're                                built to recover from failures they are                                shared services where multiple                                applications might be using the same                                technologies and so a lot of this is                                what led to investigation that ended up                                leading us to found ro Khanna I'm going                                to talk about the investigation I'm                                going to talk a little bit about the                                background and the different areas we                                use to kind of inspire how we think                                about solving these problems before I                                jump into that just to highlight a                                little bit about the evolution of IT if                                you haven't been living in a data center                                if you haven't been operating these                                systems it's worth taking a step back to                                understand the context in which people                                run these technologies today                                if you go way back                                                     were running minis you known on x                                  systems maybe they had to deal with tens                                of different systems right it was kind                                of a collection of different systems                                under management that you could write                                down on a piece of paper you could put                                it on a big whiteboard you could print                                it out and understand what things are                                going on in the era of web                                             to x                                                                    were maybe hundreds of different systems                                we named our servers after cities or                                planets and you could still mentally map                                that in your head there were specialized                                different servers the web server web one                                maybe web to maybe web three now it's                                kind of the extent of the system and                                over the past decade as virtualization                                has been introduced we've now moved to a                                world where you maybe have thousands and                                it's still an architecture map that you                                can reason about you can search through                                different systems the redundancies are                                still built in largely at the hardware                                layer or in the case of virtualization                                by being able to do say disaster                                recovery or emotion over the past few                                years certainly with the onset of Amazon                                Web Services and now Google cloud engine                                with talking about you know i'll come                                back to ted talk drill running at a                                thousand nodes by GA when you talk about                                Hadoop appointments in the thousand                                nodes and that's one component of a                                system that's running in multiple data                                centers we're now in the tens of                                hundreds of thousands right and so you                                see this introduction and complexity the                                number of nodes in the logical data                                center network is growing and this is a                                 log based graph right just so you can                                 see the size of the bars if we plot this                                 linearly this is where we are we're at                                 the hockey stick in terms of complexity                                 of the data center what this means is                                 that whereas once you could fit the way                                 systems work in your head think of                                 banking ATM network you have your                                 mainframe you have your ATMs the bank                                 controls the entire system and they can                                 map it out today at least in the US we                                 have mobile check deposit I could be                                 flying on a plane over the Atlantic                                 a picture of a check and expect the same                                 results that check it's deposited in the                                 bank and yet there's now dozens of                                 different systems the bank isn't can                                 control of half of them it doesn't                                 control the phone it doesn't control the                                 operating system it doesn't control the                                 mobile networks and we're expecting the                                 same kind of application the same kinds                                 of results so the complexity has gone                                 through the roof and so when we started                                 realizing these problems myself and my                                 co-founders we started looking at what                                 other systems where else are people                                 dealing with this level of complexity                                 and so we took a step back and said do                                 we see complexity in the world and what                                 techniques were used by those systems                                 and a few of them came to mind the first                                 is high frequency trading or people here                                 familiar with what goes on in the world                                 of high frequency trading all right so                                 it used to be you'd have a bunch of                                 people sitting around handing paper to                                 each other trying to negotiate trades                                 today all the trading is done by                                 computers and it can be queried by                                 computers which means i can write a                                 computer system that goes to the trading                                 platform and says how many people are                                 trying to trade a particular stock in                                 fact i want to know how many people are                                 trying to trade every stock in the world                                 and so now you have this enormous                                 complexity of multiple time series                                 systems that are clocking in multiple                                 times per millisecond and so we looked                                 at what high frequency traders are doing                                 and they're building systems that use                                 not search based systems they're not                                 looking through things manually in fact                                 most traders today are not actually                                 invoking particular trades they're                                 invoking trade algorithms all right                                 there up there algorithmically operating                                 how their systems transact and what                                 they're using is a lot of columnar                                 technology they're actually applying Big                                 Data technologies allow them to store                                 every single quote every single trade                                 everything that happens historically so                                 they can develop an algorithm a                                 hypothesis about how they might be able                                 to trade and then go back in time and                                 play it through history and say would                                 this have been successful over time and                                 so it's a much more analytical approach                                 that then they get to decide on the fly                                 do they use one algorithm or another in                                 order to effectively operate the system                                 in which the running which is in this                                 case                                 trading stocks the other one which I'm                                 sure you're all now well familiar with                                 is ad targeting there's been talks today                                 and at many conferences about how ad                                 targeting systems work I go to a web                                 page whether it's Google or another                                 there's a special space on the page                                 that's reserved for hundreds of                                 different companies to within a few                                 milliseconds as the page is rendering                                 collect a little bit of information                                 about me and bid on whether they should                                 actually be displaying an advertisement                                 at that point in time and so the                                 real-time bidding systems the                                 advertising systems behind this work in                                 some ways similarly to the high                                 frequency trading systems but the cost                                 models and the cost dynamics are very                                 different they're not trading stocks                                 which are relatively speaking static in                                 terms of this stock is for IBM and I                                 know that IBM is a known quantity                                 they're trading impressions over people                                 whose interests and what you're                                 particularly searching for changes over                                 time so now you have the same kinds of                                 algorithms / muted to think about                                 systems that are actually changing                                 dynamically and when we look today at                                 ephemeral systems I have a thousand web                                 servers but they burst to five thousand                                 web servers depending on traffic as                                 maybe a front end for a gaming system                                 how people are using that system how                                 people are involved in that system how                                 those web servers scale and then                                 contract and the profiles of them those                                 change so there's some some                                 applicability that we can think of from                                 hft there's some applicability that we                                 can think of from ad targeting and the                                 other one which is somewhat related and                                 if anyone's familiar with these system                                 personalized recommender systems you go                                 to amazon you go to facebook and                                 recommend certain things for you and                                 here again the cost model is different                                 they're not spending money anymore it's                                 a question of if I can fit one thing in                                 one place based on the last few actions                                 what would that be and here there's                                 algorithms that are designed much more                                 around pattern matching I want to take a                                 model that I've developed and designed                                 and fit that model or run that model at                                 runtime depending on the particular                                 behaviors that are occurred so we                                 basically looked at a bunch of the                                 algorithms the technologies of the                                 techniques that people were using to                                 build these systems and                                 these systems are built on a lot of the                                 things you've heard about today they're                                 built on solar and elastic they're built                                 on Hadoop and HBase and similar                                 technologies and we started thinking                                 about how do you actually see these data                                 points right if I'm not the user not the                                 person who is executing the trade I'm                                 not the person who's seeing the ad I'm                                 the analysts behind it I actually need                                 to run one of these systems and I have                                 billions of data points a day so a                                 classic charting system isn't going to                                 work I'm never going to see every single                                 data point I have thousands of                                 attributes in each of these data points                                 I'm never going to be able to visualize                                 every single facet how do I permute my                                 view of that data in a way to call up                                 things that actually give me actionable                                 biss it's not just a pie chart and a                                 line graph they're very specific                                 visualizations in very specific ways                                 that people look at this data in order                                 to understand it and we've started                                 thinking about how to apply those                                      the first one we started thinking about                                 if you've ever seen google finance it                                 looks like this at first blush you look                                 at it you say hey that's a line graph                                 that's not very interesting I've got                                 three time series so what what becomes                                 interesting is that they're not trying                                 to mix different kinds of metrics right                                 so they're basically trying to say well                                 this is change not based on the absolute                                 value of the stock it's a                                 percentage-based chain so and i look at                                 to stock in these indices they may not                                 be aligned in terms of their absolute                                 value but if i'm trading stocks the                                 percentage changes what actually care                                 about if i have a thousand dollars                                 invested in one index of or another                                 versus another the same percentage                                 change should result in the same                                 percentage gain or loss so normalizing                                 these time series is one way that this                                 visualization kind of in a very subtle                                 fashion is able to communicate a lot of                                 data a lot of data points concisely the                                 other that's interesting is these                                 annotations all right so when I look at                                 a time series graph I kinda have to                                 think about well what's actually going                                 on if I have a concrete event and let's                                 relate this back to data centers I have                                 a security intrusion product or have an                                 anomaly detection algorithm or I have an                                 IT person running a ticket system who                                 rebooted a server and i'm looking at cpu                                 metrics over time of a                                 systems and all of a sudden I see a drop                                 in CPU and then a spike and CPU well if                                 someone rebooted that system that's                                 useful information to know if I can plot                                 that against the same graph all of a                                 sudden I don't go down a rat hole trying                                 to investigate why a particular system                                 rebooted it becomes apparent for me the                                 other one that's really interesting and                                 you can plot a thousand data points you                                 can plot a billion data points is how                                 you do directed graphs when there's                                 circular aspects of the graph when you                                 have an application server a web server                                 a database server and a particular                                 session involves a hundred application                                 server calls and a thousand database                                 server calls maybe not a well-designed                                 one but right let's say ten app server                                 at                                                                     that's happening a billion times over                                 the course of the day it's very hard to                                 understand the nature of that system                                 when you have elastic number of web                                 servers when you have round-robin on                                 your application servers when your                                 database server isn't an oracle system                                 but it's cassandra right and it's                                 actually replicated and sharded across                                 free data centers but that's kind of a                                 modern application visualizing it using                                 this method and here we're just looking                                 at this is this is you know trout                                 traffic to the rock on a website but                                 visualizing it using a method where you                                 actually have sort of these sort of                                 directed data flow graphs where I'm not                                 particularly saying one note is in one                                 location I have you know a career                                 section here a career section here                                 career section there people got to it                                 from different ways allows me to                                 understand where the hotspots where do                                 things happen frequently where the                                 anomalies where things that are                                 happening a little more satirically and                                 it's it's a visualization that scales it                                 allows me to look at a billion data                                 points a day over                                                       and I can still understand the same                                 concepts behind him the other one that                                 we've been working on that's really we                                 found very useful and interesting is                                 this idea of taking standard bar charts                                 or if you look at a normal histogram but                                 then breaking them out and stacking them                                 and you can stack them to look at                                 different things you can look at sort of                                 different directions within the data set
