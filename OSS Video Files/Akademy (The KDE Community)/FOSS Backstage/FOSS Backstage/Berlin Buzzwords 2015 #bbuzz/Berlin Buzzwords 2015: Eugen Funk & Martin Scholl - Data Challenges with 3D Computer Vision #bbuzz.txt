Description: 
	A wide range of end user and industrial applications rely on accurate 3D scene representation. Automated 3D modelling from optical sensors such as LIDAR scanners, stereo or RGBD cameras became inevitable since this enables to replace the time consuming manual 3D modelling process. 

However, optical sensors deliver extremely high amount of data which is required to be processed to information. An 8 bit stereo system with 9MPx colour images delivers 4GB of data per second. Being able to make sense out of this enormous flow of data is a huge and ongoing research and development task. 

This talk will give an overview of the challenges which naturally involve efficient search, storage and scalable algorithms for information extraction from 3D data. Also an overview of practical implications on 3D reconstruction of cities, autonomous driving in public and industrial facilities, or inspection and monitoring as part of security strategies will be presented.

	                              thank you                               this is eigen and i'm martin and the                               reason we are here today is for a very                               simple fact and that is when we are                               talking about                                                      with that we mean that computers try to                               perceive the real world the physical                               world then the the challenges that we                               are that we are facing with the                                technology is very similar to what web                                people are facing it it starts with the                                perception part meaning the data                                gathering of the that is really a big                                challenge as we will see and the models                                and the data that we collect by using                                   perception technology they are extremely                                large and what is even a bigger problem                                is not only just capturing of the data                                but actually making sense of it was                                sense meaning some kind of understanding                                what what is being captured and last but                                not least visualizing all this free data                                all this                                                                but first of all why should you care                                about                                                                   of the most important parts to realize                                whenever you start to be interested in                                your new technology I time when I had a                                desktop computer and this computer was                                not connected with any other computer                                and only recently we really started to                                to to connect these systems with each                                other from a technological standpoint of                                the world wide web is not really new but                                the interesting thing about the world                                wide web is as soon as you start to                                connect machines together so some is                                much greater than the individual parts                                that make up the world wide web and                                really the value lies in connecting                                different realms being computers                                together and forming the world wide web                                now when we are talking about modern                                devices like smartphones or any kind of                                mobile device we are now facing a very                                similar situation where this technology                                is now being started to be connected to                                a new realm                                but this time it is not the digital                                realm if you will but the physical world                                through                                                                a big shift when it comes to the                                advancement of technology I don't know                                what the next big thing will be when it                                was regard to these mobile devices and                                and the perception of the physical world                                but i'm pretty sure that the effect of                                on on society and technology will be                                very similar in size and impact in                                general so what is                                                    used for at this point already for                                instance there's a startup called kiva                                systems they were bought by amazon just                                some years ago and as you can see these                                little orange things at the bottom these                                are autonomous systems who bring the                                individual goods that Emerson has in its                                warehouses to the people packaging it                                there's another startup called local                                mortos and they are really into                                autonomous driving and how you can use                                                                                                      driven by itself so to say they are also                                started often companies using                                   technology for inspection and                                maintenance for instance here to read                                regions which are really hard to reach                                for humans or even in mining to drive                                these really big trucks or they are                                already being driven autonomously and                                how doin it how to achieve this through                                                                                                     new thing if you will especially from a                                consumer perspective in                                               Kinect was introduced to the market                                featuring a                                                           and the depth sensor and the the cool                                thing of course was was was connect                                which I guess plenty of you here already                                have used is that it that you have a                                completely different way to interact                                with a gaming console through through                                connect and now what is remarkable to me                                and in just five years i mean the the                                kinect required an external power supply                                because it took so many power that the                                USB bus wasn't enough to power it now                                there's project tango                                Google and just within five years they                                 have basically shrink-wrapped here                                 Microsoft Kinect technology into a                                 mobile device a phablet to be precise                                 and but but but both these devices they                                 generally only work indoor as far as we                                 can tell form for the project tango part                                 there's also of course technologies that                                 can be used outside and it's one where i                                 can actually is working on and it is                                 called integrated positioning system                                 from the German Space Agency and T you                                 can probably see this blue thing on on                                 the helmet right over here this is the                                 integrated positioning system and it                                 uses two cameras to perceive the world                                 and                                                                    other sensors the key thing to take with                                 you here is that it because of these                                 different sensors that it uses namely                                 just regular camera technology basically                                 it can not only be used in door as in                                 case was connect but also outdoor but                                 you probably have noticed that all of                                 these devices have basically more than                                 one sensor to grasp what's going on is a                                 physical world and this is for a good                                 reason namely we as humans we have                                 extremely sophisticated visual system if                                 you will and just by looking at a                                 two-dimensional picture like this one                                 you can get the kind of get to physical                                 dimensions in us in a certain way at                                 least but when we are really just                                 considering or the computer would see                                 well the computer would basically just                                 get a two-dimensional picture literally                                 of the world and would not have enough                                 information to really get the third                                 dimension so to say the depths so to                                 visualize what is missing in this                                 picture although we kind of grasp it as                                 a human beings as being depicted in the                                 second picture titled depth map here the                                 white parts in the image are the parts                                 of the of the image of the left side                                 which are nearer to the camera so the                                 darker the color                                 the more away from from the perspective                                 of the camera is the individual pixel                                 and the reason I come up with this is to                                 understand basically due to base the                                 technology and the basic things for the                                 second part of the talk and because when                                 you combine this information that is                                 being visualized in both images into one                                 you get something that is called a                                    point cloud and this is basically just                                 the extension of the two-dimensional                                 image with a third dimension and namely                                 the depth but again you can probably see                                 a certain issues arising there's a very                                 white part right over here and this is                                 yeah this is one of the key things to                                 take with here that even though we have                                 a two-dimensional picture that is being                                 added to certain mention it doesn't mean                                 that the the image that we get from the                                 surrounding is complete so everything                                 that is wide over they are in the                                 rightmost picture is basically data that                                 is missing where we know nothing about                                 oh this is important to understand when                                 we come to this technology of course the                                 image that you just saw and the the                                 depths information this is what you can                                 get if you use sensors like we just                                 described in terms of connect or off the                                 integrated positioning system when you                                 are photographing aesthetic thing like                                 like for instance what you can see over                                 there you can actually derive a                                          just by taking multiple images from                                 different perspective and this is being                                 briefly described here so just by having                                 the same thing being photographed from                                 different angles we can deduce a                                    model of the thing which is I think                                 quite a remarkable achievement so the                                 talk is titled it tighter challenges and                                 the thing about                                                          are talking really about a lot of data                                 right so for instance when we have a                                  mega mega pixel image with                                              and                                                               state-of-the-art then each of these                                 images has a row size of                                   three megabytes which translates into                                 more than                                                                just start to capture the the world with                                                                                                         much right in other words when we                                 continue with that                                                      capturing of the whole world around us                                 we end up with something like                                    terabyte of data captured the day of                                 course this is really just raw data but                                 you can probably imagine that that this                                 is a huge problem to deal with first                                 question of course is what are we going                                 to do with all these terabytes of data                                 and more importantly of course we are                                 mean you're not just into collecting all                                 this data of course we want to derive                                 information from it and even more                                 importantly when we are talking about                                 autonomous systems we not only want to                                 understand what is there what we also                                 want to weave to relate it which it                                 means that we want to be able to search                                 it too so that we can find things again                                 which we have seen before for instance                                 these are just one of the few high-level                                 generators that one faces when dealing                                 with                                                                    to to introduce to the stage because he                                 is really easy expert and he can give                                 you more information on all these issues                                 so um they're coming on to the question                                 how to store to model the data                                 structures and this is a topic where I                                 particularly work on and this is                                 actually a current state of the art it's                                 about the idea how to deal with the data                                 not about frameworks and the core                                 concept is to apply volume modeling for                                 our world as you can see here for                                 somebody's Mario and a voxel is                                 basically a                                                           and the difference to do to this                                 approach which is kind of common in                                 computer graphics we divide the full                                 world in voxels and represent the                                 surface which is actually observed by                                 the camera by interface between negative                                 and positive values so actually we                                 use each measurement from the camera to                                 set this value is negative and positive                                 and to represent the surface here as an                                 example in                                                               in green and negative in red and the                                 surface is between them is also                                 visualized hear correctly so actually                                 why do we use this approach because it                                 helps us to integrate new measurements                                 really fast without to perform large                                 recomputation of the environment so                                 every time when a new image arrives from                                 the sensor this approach helps us to                                 integrate the new information easily and                                 in order to store it like three based                                 data structures are usually applied so                                 in this case an oak tree where each                                 voxel is stored only when there is a                                 measurement so maybe you can think why                                 should i store something allocate memory                                 for something which is not being                                 measured but this is no such trivial                                 because for years ago we didn't even                                 have this approach to store the data so                                 using oak trees or binary splitting                                 trees it's kind of a research right now                                 but whatever right now we're in the                                 situation that where we can store the                                 data using linear memory allocation and                                 we increase the access time by combining                                 it with the hash tables so actually an                                 octree stored in a hashmap and if you                                 are looking for a specific coordinate                                 like in its ready position X Y Z first                                 of all we find the corresponding cache                                 entry the link to the oak tree and then                                 we find by going down the oak tree                                 they're required like cube like a walk                                 so and the reason why I'm Nash maps I                                 use this when we traverse the full oak                                 tree then the complexity of existing a                                 data point depends on the haight on the                                 depth of the oak tree actually so we                                 will use it here or two to maybe maximum                                 three levels and apply the constant                                 search using hash maps so this is quite                                 efficient and of course there are some                                 demonstrations some examples where this                                 is applied here you can see I Chappell                                 Chappell close to Munich with a                                 resolution of three centimeters a drone                                 a UAV was flying around taking pictures                                 and this tower I would just not well                                 seen here is like zoomed in so you can                                 see the visualized mesh of this and also                                 what I described implicit voxel approach                                 we are positive a green and negative a                                 red and actually the structure in                                 between them is shown here as a surface                                 like it's common for computer graphic                                 for rendering with OpenGL and the same                                 tech technology is being applied for                                 making from from a vehicle this is a                                 test run from braunschweig where the                                 stereo system was mounted with a car and                                 I was living streets yeah along the                                 travel path ok so what do we have now by                                 introducing this technique right now we                                 can access a voxel by                                                  this enables us to model to tour to                                 integrate the new measurements with the                                 speed of two frames per second using                                 this small resolution so actually did                                 not so much and in order to be able to                                 deploy these technologies to some                                 realistic scenarios we would like to                                 achieve like                                                          time and a generation of measures for                                 visualization what I showed you in a                                 slide before from the chapel is also                                 another issue I mean they are approaches                                 but they are still not scalable in order                                 to be used in production and object                                 recognition is there actually yeah next                                 logic topic but it's very application                                 dependent and yeah not covered here ok                                 so and in summary we have this oak tree                                 implicit voxel modeling framework and it                                 enables us to represent                                 very efficient geordie model and also                                 the storage requirement is not so high                                 so actually for                                                      plane of three centimeters we would only                                 require                                                                  to the whole stuff today we are able to                                 reconstruct a                                                            using algorithms and some                                 state-of-the-art computer vision                                 techniques budget is extremely                                 challenging and the infrastructure which                                 is actually required to take the value                                 of the out of the results doesn't exist                                 so we have no standards here no                                 providers and there are only a few                                 internal solutions in some companies                                 which mainly work on computer vision and                                 in order to present the results some                                 fast making solutions are developed just                                 to present it's for showcases and from                                 our opinion is that the                                    digitalization with mobile systems is                                 today in the state like yeah the web in                                 the                                                                      come and yeah you are welcome for                                 discussion of your ideas how would you                                 maybe approach this issue these problems                                 with large data and ya thang                                 you
