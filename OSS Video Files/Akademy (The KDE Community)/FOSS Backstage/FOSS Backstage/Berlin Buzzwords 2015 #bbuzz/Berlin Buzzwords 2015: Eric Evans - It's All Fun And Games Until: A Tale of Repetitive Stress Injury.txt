Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2015: Eric Evans - It's All Fun And Games Until: A Tale of Repetitive Stress Injury
Publication date: 2015-06-04
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2015 #bbuzz
Description: 
	I spent years ignoring ergonomics, operating under an arrogance that the health issues associated with long hours behind a keyboard were something that happened to others, and not Me. Unsurprisingly, I would learn the hard way that I was wrong.

Years of surgery, physical therapy, medication, and a healthier set of work habits have taught me the value of an ounce of prevention. In this presentation I relate a cautionary tale of mistakes made, consequences incurred, and the lessons learned along the way.

	                              yeah I'm very happy to be here um this                               is kind of the highlight of my year                               buzzwords is my favorite conference we                               were just I was just talking to Simon I                               was one of the people that stood up                               yesterday when Isabelle asked how many                               people had been at the first one I've                               been it at everyone since then I've                               actually spoken it ever every buzzword                                since then though this is my first                                keynote buzz words or otherwise so take                                solace in knowing if I screw this up no                                one would be more upset than me and I do                                want to thank you all for showing up                                this morning I had a little trepidation                                of my own this is you maybe it's a bit                                off topic and I'll seem a little weird                                for a for a tech conference but I think                                it's you know it's pretty safe to say                                that you know we all spend a great deal                                of time in front of our computers and                                there are some health risks associated                                with that and I think we could we could                                do with raising the awareness a bit                                before I get started I do want to make                                it absolutely clear that I am NOT a                                doctor I'm not a medical professional of                                any kind I don't even play one on                                television I'm going to tell a story my                                story of the troubles I've had with                                repetitive stress injury and in doing so                                I kind of invariably have to talk about                                symptoms and diagnosis and treatment and                                maybe a little bit about workstation                                ergonomics but you shouldn't take any of                                that home with you as you know as as                                information you should act on the only                                thing I would hope you you would take                                home with you is that you should go get                                medical advice and then and then follow                                it so every story has a beginning I'm                                choosing to SAP mine in the year                                     it's a bit arbitrary it certainly                                doesn't represent when I first started                                using computers but prior to                                        would have been more or less as a                                secondary tool for work in school and as                                a hobby                                                          because it's when I got my my very first                                job at a                                tech startup                                                           this industry and a lot has changed but                                i think you know what it what it means                                to work at a start-up is remain largely                                the same so just sort of you know set                                the scene you know we had a small group                                of small group of relatively young                                energetic people you know a group that                                was very much believed in the mission                                you know true believers would be a good                                way to describe us we had a bit of money                                but in those early days of a startup you                                know that's viewed as a runway and that                                runway gets a bit shorter every day you                                have these really concrete sort of                                milestones you have to reach by a                                certain period of time before you can                                kind of move on before you become                                established this kind of fuels this                                sense of urgency this this need to get                                things done to do whatever it takes                                everybody wears multiple hats everyone's                                a basically on call it kind of results                                in this culture of heroics for me                                personally though that what overshadowed                                that was just the amount of fun I had it                                was it was kind of the right place at                                the right time for me I would                                characterize it as like the most the                                thing that stuck out to me the most was                                what they would let me do you know                                anywhere else you know the established                                company I would have been seen deemed as                                to junior or we're not having the right                                background for you know a good many of                                these projects but all I needed was a                                can-do attitude and and they would let                                me you know that would let me work on                                things on top of that you know they let                                me do crazy out-of-the-box thinking so I                                just had so much fun I learned so much a                                typical day for me you know i would                                bounce out of the bed out of bed in the                                morning just super excited to get                                started which is a good way to be and i                                would show up you know strictly earlier                                than i needed too often before anyone                                else i would work long on interrupted                                hours those early days you know we had                                 lunch catered in and so I didn't even                                 need to suffer the interrupt                                 chin to get something to eat I could                                 just drag a play back to my desk and I                                 would work into the evening and                                 oftentimes I would go home and I would                                 work some more you know I worked through                                 the weekend I would pull all-nighters I                                 loved holidays holiday for me is when                                 everyone else took a holiday because in                                 the office was empty and I could just                                 get a I could get so much done in it I'd                                 like to think that I have a good work                                 ethic but that's not what this was I                                 would have told you at the time I was a                                 hacker this is what i did this is the                                 thing as I thought about having this job                                 all it really did was afford me the                                 luxury of thinking about it you know                                 full time without worrying about how I                                 was going to put food on the table and                                 all of this kind of fit in well with                                 this you know this early stage of the                                 startup this culture of heroics you just                                 looked like I was you know really                                 pulling for the team I think that                                 initial initial super intense period of                                 a startup usually is pretty pretty fine                                 I pretty short either you fail and you                                 know let's let's admit it most startups                                 do or you succeed and more resources                                 become available and more people are                                 hired and there's less pressure on that                                 initial group around this time though is                                 when we had that first big crash in tech                                 and a bursting of the bubble and I think                                 just being the first time this happened                                 I think there was a lot of a lot of                                 skepticism that it would ever recover                                 and so while we were doing really well                                 you know investor confidence was so far                                 it was so down that it kind of cast                                 doubt on our future so we did something                                 very unusual for for such an early stage                                 startup for such a young company we                                 became profitable and we did it by just                                 sheer hard work just sheer force of will                                 we doubled down we did even more from                                 less so two years on if anything it's                                 just gotten more intense for me and the                                 first few cracks started to show I                                 started to get some pain in my in my                                 hands and my wrist at my forearms I                                 started to get some numbness and                                 tingling in my fingers and this would                                 have been in the fingers on the inside                                 of my hand so the thumb index finger and                                 maybe told lesser degree the ring finger                                 occasionally from time to time I could                                 always correlate it to recent activity I                                 could say well I just came off an                                 all-nighter or I just put in a row                                 particularly hard week to get something                                 launched on time I could always                                 correlate it with recent events and that                                 unfortunately kind of fueled this denial                                 that that it wasn't anything to worry                                 about that that you know that was just a                                 you know simple a simple case of                                 overwork or or strain you know that was                                 fine I go home I take a nice long                                 weekend or something stay away from the                                 keyboard and I would feel better and                                 that reinforced this I don't really know                                 what what I was thinking back then but I                                 had this real sense of of I don't know                                 denial that I felt as if this didn't                                 apply to me that you know repetitive                                 stress injuries were something that                                 happened to other people and that this                                 wasn't something I needed to worry about                                 her at least not right now it just it                                 just couldn't make it a priority and so                                 this sort of episodic major just helped                                 me kind of dismiss it as well that's                                 nothing obviously I feel better it must                                 be okay but another year down the road                                 and the pain is getting a little worse                                 so is the numbness and tingling it's now                                 joined by neck pain shoulder pain back                                 pain I'm getting some pretty bad                                 headaches and it's becoming often it's                                 no longer you know episodic I can no                                 longer correlate it to any given                                 activity it's actually becoming kind of                                 constant and I'm kind of ashamed to say                                 that that what really got me what made                                 me decide to go to go see a doctor                                 wasn't out of fear what I was doing to                                 my body it was that it was getting in                                 the way of things it wasn't you know it                                 was interfering with my was my output                                 and for some reason I still thought I                                 would go to the doctor and everything                                 would just be you know it would just be                                 something simple so I went to see my                                 primary care physician the doctor I see                                 for you know most things and I was right                                 it was a very short visit                                 she wanted to wanted to know what the                                 symptoms were she made note of what I                                 did for a living and promptly referred                                 me to an orthopedic hand surgeon who                                 specializes in occupational injuries                                 that's not a diagnosis but it made it                                 pretty obvious what she was thinking so                                 I I called to set up an appointment with                                 this hand surgeon and they have a few                                 questions you know like what do you do                                 for living what are your symptoms and                                 they wouldn't even see me they wouldn't                                 even put me on the calendar until I                                 first got a nerve conduction study from                                 a neurologist now nerve conduction study                                 is a diagnostic procedure that's used to                                 determine whether or not you have carpal                                 tunnel syndrome which is sort of the                                 poster child for for repetitive stress                                 injuries so I still didn't have a                                 diagnosis but it was pretty obvious what                                 they were thinking before I explain what                                 the nerve conduction study is let me                                 tell another story take a small side I                                 promise to circle back around I spent                                 the latter years of my teens living in                                 the city of El Paso Texas so for those                                 of you who are not familiar with US                                 geography which i assume is everyone                                 here from the US El Paso is a city in                                 West Texas it's a very very remote out                                 in the middle of the desert if you think                                 is sort of stereotypical idea of of a                                 desert in the u.s. Southwest you know                                 cactuses sagebrush tumbleweeds nothing                                 but sand that's it exactly but it is a                                 border community so if you look at El                                 Paso from the air it looks like this is                                 one big city with a river running                                 through the middle of it when in fact                                 everything north of that river is the                                 u.s. it's El Paso and every everything                                 south of that river is the city of wat                                 is in Mexico so everything north of that                                 river has a drinking age of                                    everything's South                                                     you're a teenager living in in El Paso                                 and it's hot and it's boring and all you                                 have to do is walk across the bridge                                 into what is to buy a beer like everyone                                 else that's what you're going to do                                 and it wasn't just me thousands of                                 american teenagers flocked there every                                 friday and saturday night making that                                 place very very strange it was strange I                                 think it was strange precisely because                                 it was filled with hammered American                                 teenagers they had this guy who would go                                 around from bar to bar club to club with                                 this device called caja de tokus which i                                 think translates to something like box                                 of shocks her box of electrical shocks                                 this is what a google image search says                                 this looks like that's not what I                                 remember this site this thing looks very                                 I don't know manufactured what I                                 remember looked like it was cobbled                                 together out of bits and pieces of                                 household appliances I distinctly                                 remember a bear transformer kind of                                 haphazardly screwed a piece of scrap                                 plywood with just bare wires everywhere                                 not the sort of thing that you know                                 synonymous was safety but this man would                                 set up at a booth or a table and people                                 would line up to sit opposite of him and                                 crucially pay him money like a dollar or                                 something so that they could pick up                                 these electrodes and let the man shock                                 them I would love to tell you what the                                 point of this is what you know what this                                 is all about the truth is I have no idea                                 I used to think it was maybe you know                                 like some contest because the man would                                 turn the knob up as this this went                                 through and of course they would rise                                 and twist and twitch and it was just                                 this grotesque spectacle then he would                                 announce the number at the end and and                                 everyone would cheer but they cheered no                                 matter what they cheered no matter what                                 the number was and nobody seemed to be                                 keeping track of it so I really don't                                 think it was a contest now to put this                                 in further context you know I'm I'm                                 let's say                                                             most males of our species I have peaked                                 I have reached my peak by that i mean                                 i'm at peak stupidity                                 at no point prior in my life or no point                                 sense have I been more stupid than I was                                 right then and on top of this I'm                                 drinking alcohol makes everybody stupid                                 so it's it's compounded stupidity if                                 there was ever a window of time ever a                                 period when you could convince me to do                                 something heinous ly stupid this was it                                 and many people succeeded but I never                                 once participated in this this whole                                 ritual of the caja de tokus in fact i                                 SAT back and sort of you know righteous                                 condemnation you shaking my head and                                 it's stuck with me all of these years                                 it's for me it's kind of rule number one                                 it's you know you do not pay someone to                                 electrocute you everything after that's                                 optional so what does this have to do                                 with the nerve conduction study it's the                                 same thing it's exactly the same thing                                 it's really it's right in the name nerve                                 conduction the nerves are yours thus you                                 are the conductor and what we are                                 conducting is electricity it's all                                 wrapped up in a much tidier package if                                 you look at this picture you know we can                                 see the sharps container and the gloves                                 dispensers mounted to the wall behind                                 our patient this gentleman here in the                                 foreground he appears to be sitting on                                 an exam table this woman is clearly the                                 neurologist and she's got her scrubs on                                 she looks very professional she looks                                 you know like a medical professional                                 even the equipment looks a little bit                                 better what we can see of it it's a it's                                 attached to a laptop computer so it's                                 got to be legit but make no mystery                                 about it this guy's about to get popped                                 and when he does he's probably going to                                 come flying up off this table when he                                 lands and his heart is racing and his                                 breathing a shallow and rapid I suspect                                 he'll be contemplating the stupidity                                 that that led him to directly or                                 indirectly be you know paying this woman                                 to                                 camera but there is a method to this                                 madness and I think it helps to                                 understand what carpal tunnel syndrome                                 is so the carpal tunnel is this this                                 area here at the base of your palm it's                                 like a very narrow little opening                                 through which all of the tendons and the                                 the nerves and the blood vessels                                 traverse and it's all everything's kind                                 of held in place with this carpal                                 ligament through repetitive motion of                                 your of your fingers in your hand the                                 repetitive motion of these these tendons                                 this fluid-filled sheath which is shown                                 here in the dark blue can become                                 inflamed and you know it swells and                                 makes that that already compact area                                 much more compact and and you know your                                 builds pressure within there and that                                 can impinge the blood flow and can                                 impinge the nerves the body is very                                 flexible and you know of course you can                                 heal from this you will heal from this                                 but in doing so little scar tissues                                 formed and that you know it's formed                                 within that carpal tunnel and so it                                 makes makes it a little tighter and                                 makes it a little easier for that to                                 happen you know subsequently you know                                 eventually you have so much scar tissue                                 in there that it's it's very difficult                                 for that information inflammation to go                                 down and you know it just becomes sort                                 of the new normal so the the nerve                                 conduction study is you know it's                                 transmitting an electrical current down                                 your arm measuring the you know the                                 response or the output at your fingers                                 to look for that that impingement of the                                 nerve in my case the median nerve would                                 explain the numbness in the fingers on                                 the inside of my hand so my nerve                                 conduction study resulted in a diagnosis                                 of carpal tunnel syndrome which I guess                                 at this point was not terribly                                 surprising and with this diagnosis I was                                 able to to finally go see this this hand                                 surgeon there were a few things that                                 were surprising in that initial visit                                 perhaps first and foremost was even                                 though he is a hand surgeon the majority                                 of what he does is an attempt to avoid                                 hand surgery to address the root causes                                 and see if we can't get you better                                 without it with                                 out surgery the surgery is a sort of                                 weapon of last resort another of the                                 more surprising things that came out of                                 that visit is I never mentioned to him                                 any of those other symptoms the the                                 headache backaches neck pain shoulder                                 pain never never brought any of that up                                 and yet he began talking about it as if                                 it was you know just a matter of fact as                                 if as if he had known all along and this                                 is I guess when I kind of realized that                                 I was not a unique and special snowflake                                 he explained that you know these that                                 essentially these these behaviors this                                 activity and you know particularly when                                 you're not not adhering to the correct                                 posture and ergonomics it results in                                 some very little fairly standard set of                                 symptoms and injuries and typically it's                                 more than just you know you know pain in                                 your hands the body is a system                                 everything is connected and so generally                                 this sort of abuse and stress and strain                                 affects many parts of your body he set                                 in motion a number of things that day                                 the first of which was the work site                                 evaluation so what this is is you have a                                 physical therapist who also has a                                 specialty in occupational injuries comes                                 out to wherever it is you work kind of                                 sits off to the side watch as you do                                 your thing take some notes and then                                 pulls you pulls you off to the side and                                 tells you what it is you're doing wrong                                 most importantly why these wrong things                                 are causing you pain you know creating                                 injuries they they tell you what it is                                 you should be doing they give you a set                                 of good behaviors some stretching                                 exercises stressing the importance of                                 breaks and they help you set up your                                 workstation so you know the height of                                 everything the angle of everything                                 relationship of all of the pieces and                                 again most importantly with explanations                                 as to why this is good or why this is                                 better I was given physical therapy I                                 think this was something like                                           a week for something like four to six                                 weeks there were a variety of things                                 done and                                 some of which I just to this day I don't                                 really understand ultrasound therapies                                 we're supposed to have some impact on                                 the nerves but I never really quite                                 interested why there was a fair amount                                 of like what seemed like massage therapy                                 and I think that was about breaking up                                 some of the scar tissue in that in that                                 region and loosening loosening up the                                 tissues there's also a lot of strength                                 training a lot of resistance training I                                 also started diagnostic injections man                                 these things are fun it's not an                                 intravenous injection is steroids they                                 put it right into that carpal tunnel                                 area when you look at the injection you                                 look at the volume of fluid and you're                                 thinking you know conservation of mass I                                 don't think that's going to all fit in                                 there when he starts pressing you know                                 pressing on the plunger and for some                                 reason he's gotta push really hard you                                 know he's got he's got to bear down into                                 it then it really feels like it's not                                 going to fit all in there the                                 expectation is this is this may make you                                 feel better in the days and weeks to                                 come but the intention is not to make                                 you feel better for the sake of it he                                 puts this injection in a different place                                 each time and then asks you to you know                                 to detail take detailed notes report                                 back to him will you know what relief                                 you had so he can kind of build up a map                                 of what's going on inside your hand                                 based on what you know what areas give                                 you relief there's also a diminishing                                 return to these injections so every                                 subsequent injection you know the dose                                 gets a little bigger to compensate for                                 this and yeah you thought it was bad the                                 first time over the last time you know                                 my hand was just black and blue was                                 really bad yeah good times I also                                 started taking anti-inflammatories we                                 tried a number of different things ended                                 up settling on nsaids like you'd buy                                 over-the-counter naproxen or ibuprofen                                 although in significantly higher doses                                 than what the bottle recommends                                 prescription level doses and this was                                 all that you know every day several                                 times a day for                                 weeks and months probably the least                                 surprising thing is I was sent home with                                 splints I've already been thinking about                                 how I was going to explain that fashion                                 choice but it was my doctor's opinion                                 that that there was little value in                                 wearing these around during the day and                                 while you work so long as you're                                 maintaining the right you know                                 positioning in posture he just wanted me                                 to where I'm at night to keep from                                 sleeping on them you know impinging that                                 nerve further at night so I followed all                                 the directions did everything that was                                 asked of me by this point I'm taking it                                 fully seriously I no longer believe that                                 that this is not you know this is                                 something I don't need to worry about it                                 I do in fact believe at this point that                                 it affects me as well and so a year                                 later by                                                              the carpal tunnel syndrome in my right                                 hand was significantly worse than my                                 left but have been you know in my left                                 it had reached a point where I would                                 call it you know manageable it was good                                 if I if I did what I was supposed to                                 headaches backaches neck pain all that's                                 pretty much gone at this point and the                                 right hand the worst of the two hands is                                 much improved but not not not fully                                 better still a lot of numbness and                                 tingling and you don't want to let that                                 go unchecked because that can result in                                 nerve damage and the nerve damage                                 results in some pretty debilitating                                 disfigurements of the hand so you                                 definitely gotta stay on top of that so                                 at this point we elected to have surgery                                 surgery on the right hand the surgery                                 for this is actually remarkably simple                                 they just sever that transverse carpal                                 ligament that band that kind of holds                                 everything in place they make like a                                 zigzag incision and then the expectation                                 is it'll heal a little longer than and                                 what it was to begin with and and                                 relieve some of that pressure in there                                 there came with some restrictions after                                 the surgery you know limits on how much                                 I could lift and you know how much                                 gripping of things I could do and stuff                                 ironically the one thing I could do when                                 I went home and I did                                 sit in front of the keyboard and type as                                 long as I could deal with the thick                                 surgical dressing I could go home and                                 type I thought that was very strange                                 after the surgery I had more physical                                 therapy this seemed more geared geared                                 towards a recovery from the surgery than                                 the first bit so less of that resistance                                 training so then fast forward to                                      surgery worked pretty good my right hand                                 is now my good hand everything's good                                 there everything everything else is                                 essentially manageable at this point but                                 in                                                                  numbness and tingling in my fingers this                                 time it's some of the fingers on the                                 outside of my hands though so the pinky                                 the ring finger I go back to the doctor                                 right away again I no longer think that                                 the that I can avoid this you know that                                 I did it that it doesn't apply to me and                                 I get a diagnosis of cubital tunnel                                 syndrome kind of messes up the whole                                 acronym cts you never know cts there's                                 like two of them cubital tunnel syndrome                                 though is an impingement of a different                                 nerve it's an impingement of the ulnar                                 nerve which explains the different                                 fingers going numb and it's an                                 impingement at the elbow how I got this                                 is you know quite possibly is it was a                                 result of some some you know some damage                                 already done prior to this and I was                                 reminded by my doctor that you know                                 that's that the abuse that had led up to                                 me being treated for carpal tunnel                                 syndrome probably did it did other                                 damage as well but I had also started to                                 get quite lazy and lacks on my organ ah                                 miix you know in that window sense and                                 one of the things I had done is started                                 to have the the arm rests on my chair                                 creep upward to the point where as i was                                 typing I had my weight you know I had                                 the weight of my arms down on top of the                                 of the armrest I was applying pressure                                 and that's kind of notorious for this so                                 in addition to getting my organ aam                                 Ock's fixed getting back on track with                                 that I was given splints again to wear                                 again at night                                 prevent you from sleeping with your your                                 elbows bent and impinging the nerve                                 while you sleep the options for surgery                                 for this are are much more limited                                 they're less less lower success rate                                 with the surgery it's more complicated                                 more invasive takes longer to recover                                 from so you have to be pretty bad to get                                 surgery for this one I still kind of                                 have a problem with this from time to                                 time I'll get the numbness and tingling                                 and I'll have to remember to put my                                 splint son and I sleep with my arms                                 straight so then fast forward to earlier                                 this year I started to get some pain                                 again this time in my on the outer                                 portion of my forearm round where it                                 connects to the elbow I went to the                                 doctor and I get this diagnosis that                                 camp an ass but they call it Mouse elbow                                 or tennis elbow there's actually a lot                                 of activities that are really                                 susceptible to this carpenters get it                                 from swinging a hammer and of course you                                 know those of us who sit behind a                                 keyboard all day can get it from from                                 using the mouse it's sort of a strain on                                 this tendon that connects the extensor                                 muscles and forearm to the elbow how I                                 got this is probably again it may have                                 been something I had been courting for                                 years I had also again started to become                                 slack in the intervening years and with                                 respect to the height and distance of                                 where the mouse was relative to the                                 keyboard and you know palm rests and arm                                 rests I was I was getting a little                                 playing it a little fast and loose again                                 I was also killing a lot of zombies                                 around this time you know in addition to                                 my daily workload I you know I was                                 killing a fair amount of zombies and of                                 course that requires a little extra so                                 in addition to getting my my ergonomics                                 back on track and killing a few few less                                 zombies I started taking some                                 anti-inflammatories again and I was                                 given this brace another the fashion                                 choice I had to explain to people sort                                 of a band with a little plastic nodule                                 that sits over that area I think the                                 intent of which is to kind of give you                                 some additional support                                 so then fast forward today to today as                                 of today I would say I'm you know more                                 or less healthy I feel like I've never                                 quite been the same since you know since                                 since this got to the point that I had                                 to go to the doctor the first time even                                 more more so than what I mentioned                                 during the timeline I have kind of you                                 know from quite often sort of gotten                                 lakhs on the on the you know I'm taking                                 breaks on the stretching exercises or                                 you know kind of allowed my ergonomics                                 to to go out outside of you know                                 protocol and I'm usually reminded with                                 some some old pain and then I and I get                                 back on track and then everything's fine                                 feels like it's just kind of under the                                 surface and I have been able to maintain                                 a pretty good pretty good pace you know                                 I work a good number of hours a fair                                 number of hours though I do know my                                 limitations these days I'm able to put                                 in a very full week and do so relatively                                 comfortable but I have to you know I                                 really have to kind of stay on top of                                 things I don't seem to have much wiggle                                 room anymore so let's let's step back a                                 little bit take some retrospective see                                 what we can learn from all of this the                                 main thing for me like the main takeaway                                 of everything that I had you know that                                 every bit of assistance i got from from                                 medicine the one thing that you know                                 hands down I wouldn't trade away was                                 that work site evaluation this is                                 essentially just you know a couple of                                 hours of my time nothing was done to me                                 it was entirely knowledge transfer but I                                 got more relief in just you know in just                                 the the subsequent few days than any                                 other single you know treatment or or                                 procedure you know ever gave and the one                                 thing I sort of credit with allowing me                                 to continue to follow my passions all                                 these years you know are these you know                                 is essentially what I had what I learned                                 and when I fall off the wagon when I                                 when I fail to                                 to follow this it's you know it's                                 returning to this the set of protocols                                 that puts me back on track the main                                 takeaway I got from this you know again                                 don't go home and practice ergonomics                                 based on anything you heard here but the                                 thing I found that you know that kind of                                 resonated with everything that they                                 taught me was this kind of this idea of                                 you know remaining balance tour                                 anatomically neutral when you work you                                 know we're kind of vertical structures                                 you know you know we're we're best                                 adapted to supporting our own weight and                                 enormous stresses you know in the                                 vertical and so when we when we you know                                 leave that that vertical when we're                                 leaning you know forward or backward                                 which is which seems very very common                                 and we have to hold ourselves in that                                 position our weight is distributed                                 poorly you know days or you know you                                 know occasionally this isn't an issue                                 but when it's you know week after week                                 month after month it can really take his                                 toll the the strength training that I                                 that I mentioned in the physical therapy                                 was precisely to deal with this it was                                 very targeted very focused you know at                                 it was meant to to develop the muscles                                 that had been that would counteract or                                 balance out the muscles that i had                                 developed from you know sitting hunched                                 over for example for years on end to                                 restore that kind of balance you know                                 that this this theme of anatomically                                 neutral you know pertains to the the you                                 know the rather common wisdom of keeping                                 your wrist straight when you type if you                                 go back to that diagram of the hand that                                 carpal tunnel is right there at the base                                 of the palm if you if you bend your                                 wrist while you're typing your including                                 that opening it's like pinching a garden                                 hose you know everything needs to move                                 freely through there and you're creating                                 a lot of additional pressure so you make                                 that that irritation and the subsequent                                 formation of scar tissue all the more                                 likely when you type with your wrist                                 bent you know straight is kind of the                                 anatomical anatomically neutral position                                 for that where every                                 moves freely me I committed every sin in                                 the book and I was never upright never                                 balance never anatomically neutral and I                                 was always leaning on one arm rest or                                 you know leaned back or lean forward I                                 mean this is this is like very this is                                 very common with a laptop you could                                 probably look around and see a few                                 people staring down at the screens now                                 and they're all hunched over let's see                                 see a few people like suddenly went up                                 right when I said that yeah I mean with                                 the laptop with the screen fixed to the                                 you know to the keyboard like that it's                                 very hard not to hunch over it like I                                 like it's your precious and I don't know                                 for me even now the other the more                                 intensely I get into whatever it is I'm                                 doing for some reason the closer i need                                 to get my face to that screen and the                                 more I'm hunched over I have to remember                                 not to do that I also laughed at this                                 one because I used to do this a lot                                 whenever I wasn't you know super intense                                 Deepak mode hovered over the screen I                                 was doing in this he's not doing it                                 right though the right way is to get                                 your feet kicked up on an overturned                                 trash bin or a sub woofer and then you                                 can scoot all the way in toward the                                 desks like right up in your armpits so                                 this is kind of the conventional wisdom                                 and again you know it's just to                                 demonstrate this idea of you know of                                 everything being balanced and neutral                                 you know if you look at this the monitor                                 is such a height that that she doesn't                                 have to hold you know hold her head down                                 or up you know she can she can have her                                 head balanced on her neck you know a                                 nice vertical structure that's well well                                 suited for supporting the weight and                                 just looked straight forward at the                                 screen you know her torso is upright so                                 that way it is all distributed in the                                 vertical got a little lumbar support                                 their legs bent at a                                                                                                                            is you know the weight is evenly                                 distributed as possible her arms dangles                                 straight down at her sides and then with                                 the elbows bent at a                                                   straight the keyboard is right there                                 it's all it's all meant you know                                    distribute their weight evenly and                                 across you know the structures of our                                 body that are most adapted to to                                 supporting them and just you know as                                 anatomically neutral as you could you                                 could be so over the years I you know                                 you know I've really have been really                                 elevated this work site evaluation you                                 know to you know it's to being the thing                                 you know the thing I credit with being                                 able to continue to follow my passions                                 through the intervening years but I more                                 recently believe that I've been looking                                 at this this wrong when I got my work                                 site evaluation it's set quite a                                 precedent you know I'm even know where I                                 was working no one had ever seen that                                 before and you know satna you know big                                 open area kind of war room style and and                                 so it was kind of unavoidable that                                 everybody you know everybody saw this                                 going on and they were very curious and                                 you know tried very hard to not be                                 obvious about staring and it was kind of                                 embarrassing i guess but our human                                 resource manager also noticed this and                                 she pulled aside the the physical                                 therapist and got contact information                                 and arranged for everybody to get one of                                 these worksite evaluations if they if                                 they wanted I knew that what I didn't                                 know was how many people actually took                                 them up on that in particular how many                                 people who took them up on that were                                 just people who were who were sitting                                 around me and wondering what was going                                 on that day it's only been in recent                                 years you know when I meet up with a the                                 past coworker at a conference or                                 something over beers you know we start                                 reminiscing about the old days all those                                 old people tend to do and this subject                                 will come up I remember when you had                                 your work site evaluation and that                                 prompted me to get one of my own and and                                 then they go on to in the same way I do                                 to credit it with keeping them healthy                                 and allowing them to follow their                                 passions all these years the difference                                 though is that for them it was proactive                                 for me it was reactive and obviously it                                 is so much better to avoid getting these                                 kinds of                                 than it is to deal with them after the                                 fact and I took a little solace in                                 knowing you know that that at least my                                 bad example my bad experiences may have                                 helped some others avoid those the same                                 some of those same mistakes that's kind                                 of know the genesis of this talk so why                                 I wanted to come do it I think that                                 attitude that this is you know this                                 isn't something that we need to worry                                 about it's something that doesn't                                 pertain to us I think it's a far more                                 common then we all like to admit and you                                 know it's it's really important you know                                 your health is important if you were to                                 continue to do this for decades on end                                 it's important that you be healthy                                 you're able to do it comfortably so                                 again if you take anything away from                                 this I would I would hope that it would                                 be when you go home whatever form this                                 takes you know whether they call it a                                 work site evaluation or or something                                 else find an expert and follow their                                 advice because I think you it would                                 definitely be worth it so thank you
