Description: 
	How to start a company based on a machine learning idea? And how to scale it into the "Big Data" region?

In this talk I want to share some insights that I gathered during the last 3 years while founding and successfully scaling a real-time bidding (RTB) company from a two-person startup to a leading technology provider in the field:

- From real-time to batch to real-time.
- From two people to entire teams of data scientists and engineers.
