Companies today are challenged in many different ways to provide a conclusive e-commerce search: in understanding constantly changing customer requirements and translating them to a holistic solution consisting of channels, organisation, processes, systems and data. But how can the multi-layered challenges of search be overcome and the associated opportunities exploited?

The Exploded View model from foryouandyourcustomers provides answers to these questions. It has been continuously refined and has been proven in practice. The many possible uses of the Exploded View have shown that it can present and explain decisive interrelations for the development of an organisation and that the people involved – from managers to employees with little involvement – receive an overall picture that supports them in digital and analog change.
