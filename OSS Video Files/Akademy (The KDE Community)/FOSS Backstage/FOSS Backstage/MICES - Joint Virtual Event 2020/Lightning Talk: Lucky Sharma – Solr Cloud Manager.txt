	                              hey everyone I'm lucky so today I'm                               going to talk about these food manager                               which is like a powerful tool to manage                               your solar plus choice from a single                               point so the solar the what's the origin                               of the SIS for our cloud manager so the                               reason why we came up with this solution                               is like we have once so we have multiple                               solar clusters and to manage them there                                was no centralized API or control center                                so that we can make the changes and get                                the book get it to all these requesters                                so to make that we basically create a                                solar-powered manager which basically                                has much more potential on the                                capabilities like it sizes your solar                                cloud along the clusters with the                                convicts and this could happen across                                clusters second thing is like it's a                                single interface where if you want to                                change any config or updating them or                                uploading a new config itself so you                                just need to upload that country to the                                API or the UI we have and it will just                                update that config inside zookeeper and                                reloaded your solar cell if you want to                                so it has like multiple options to do                                that other thing is like tracking down                                the CDs here changes in the status so it                                will basically track down the CDC or                                changes which is happening so once you                                trigger CDs here it will check these                                changes and notify you was it depend on                                the UI then you can also trigger the                                backup in the restore and it can notify                                you if it's an async mode that once                                they're completed along with that so                                there are cases so in our current lease                                we basically have like a live shadow                                areas to manage the data in indexes so                                to switch the aliases or creating or                                managing the aliases in the multiple of                                course or across purchase so this sole                                account manager is helpful in that cases                                and so in a case where you just want to                                switch the areas as something goes wrong                                in your life cluster we can the back end                                or team or the dev ops team can just use                                a single API to just statistical switch                                the aliases on that so here is the                                architecture proposed for this one so                                once we have multiple solar plus                                like cluster one person requester and                                this is single set of services which is                                like solar of manager running on top of                                them so and there's a react to you I                                basically which kid                                it's basically and asked the ease-of-use                                to use these a peons                                so if if there's in service-learning we                                just want to interact with the clusters                                like in Jason has switched the aliases                                of condition then they can use this API                                directly or if the something goes wrong                                and someone has to create the                                collections or update the collections                                the developers or DevOps can use the                                react UI or can just use the API which                                can directly update your clusters so                                basically the wrapper around all the APS                                we have but brings all of them under one                                umbrella this is the sort of API list we                                have so like we have four areas CDC our                                data extra mentions in the count code                                management so as you see in the area                                since we have like deleting all the                                aliases switching the aliases or you are                                no special more specific clusters all                                the aliases or just a specific you'll                                see me one is list                                similarly for other purposes like CDC                                are and the code management we have like                                cluster based thing and if I go to the                                UI part this is how simple UI looks like                                so you can select the question from the                                top down and you can see the solar                                hassle there could be cases that you can                                see that one of the cluster is down but                                other process alive so you can see from                                this UI itself that whiskerson is down                                and what are the health on other                                clusters so this is a single point of us                                or the first point of check that if                                someone was to do what how the health of                                Sola Christus is and they want to update                                it so requester or they're all the                                questions they can just use this UI and                                the services to do that so that was the                                sole account manager if you have any                                 question you can just post good slack so                                 that's what AHA the solar power manager                                 have some of the question was the                                 corresponding channel nothing one of                                 them is a lot in mind I would I would                                 bring my question at                                                 that we have we have more questions you                                 know there's a question that do you use                                 the CDC are for the disaster recovery so                                 it's not so CDC has not further deserves                                 recovery but so kinetic they are not                                 using CDs here so in cases there when                                 they are CDs here so it's basically an                                 answer the use case but some of some of                                 the cases where we need to use CDC are a                                 little recovery because like suppressor                                 one could be a blue custard cluster and                                 the red cluster so in that case yes CDC                                 are will be using but we are not using                                 in that way okay there's another                                 question that is the solar cloud manager                                 open source which was one of my                                 questions as well yeah so actually I                                 have to get repository which I'm working                                 upon so I have pretty API which are like                                 oh but suppose right now but I'm working                                 on the UI so the UI which I've shown                                 earlier it's not a fully fledged ey                                 absolutely so it will be a launching                                 soon but yeah the well I think we all                                 look forward to this being available for                                 the use I think it's going to be a great                                 utility to us one of the questions that                                 I had was that do you plan to extend                                 this for the master/slave architecture                                 as well sometime in future maybe                                 something everyone so I miss the                                 question can easily do you plan to                                 extend this kind of capability for the                                 master/slave architecture as well yeah                                 yeah so basically I'm planning to cover                                 all the cases or all the APNs to LA                                 provide so that will be a complete big                                 umbrella so nobody has to go to Seoul on                                 you were to make the change because in                                 our normal case we have multiple                                 questions right we don't operate on a                                 single solar power Moses Magnum                                 production so to manage that crisis kind                                 of cases                                 yeah I'm planning to evolve it to cover                                 also regulates okay we have lot of more                                 questions coming in but we are tight on                                 the schedule so I would but we would                                 have to take them any social section                                 snow                                 yeah we have we have very good questions                                 I would say I think I can take one last                                 question dr. Monson it says how do you                                 plan to handle security                                 the first thing a manager gets active                                 yeah so all the clusters exactly so                                 actually for security order so what we                                 are doing is like there are UI is made                                 on react and we are putting                                 authentication services like actually                                 with authentication so nobody will                                 directly if so the operation is like                                 which is this via post shortcode                                 operations we are putting security so                                 nobody can turn that                                 ok yeah so you got a shady link and I                                 think people are really excited to                                 explore that                                 ok so I think thank you so much for a                                 great talk this was pretty interesting a                                 nice thing is going to be super useful                                 for a lot of us will be using us or a                                 cloud and I look forward to your mantra                                 slave manager as well sometime soon                                 sure thank you so much I think we are                                 going to bring you back again                                 you
