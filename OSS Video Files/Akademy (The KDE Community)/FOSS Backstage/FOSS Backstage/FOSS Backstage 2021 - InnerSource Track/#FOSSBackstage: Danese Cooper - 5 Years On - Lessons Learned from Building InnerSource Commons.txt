	                              so hi                               uh my name is denise cooper and i am                               the president and founder of the                               undersource commons and this talk is the                               beginning of                               a talk i'll probably give several times                               this year about some of the lessons that                               i learned from building inner source                               commons so it's kind of a meta                                conversation                                about incenting people to join an effort                                like inner source commons and                                i think it's applicable to pretty much                                any open source community                                i have done a lot of consulting to                                companies trying to build community                                behind their open source projects                                and it's sort of the same steps so here                                we go                                so first of all why the pirates and why                                is that picture so blurry                                because it's a really tiny picture it                                was it was taken with a                                probably an insta camera at some point                                in the                                                       on the left and john scully on the right                                and behind them is the famous pirate                                flag with the apple for one eye                                that steve had made and hoisted                                over the building where the macintosh                                was created                                and they they really espoused a pirate                                ethic                                in silicon valley we talk a lot about                                skunk works                                and how you you have to take any                                innovative idea                                out of the middle of the company and                                give it its own little breathing space                                because the antibodies inside the                                company will kill it otherwise                                and that is sort of also true of inner                                source i think                                it's definitely true of open source                                efforts if it's the only thing                                that's open source in your huge company                                it's got to be at the edge and it's got                                to be                                protected now because inner source is                                about changing the core of the company                                at the end of the day it's got to get to                                the middle but it doesn't have to start                                there                                it can start with a seed or an                                experiment as i've written                                in several books now that help you                                figure out where you're going                                well we kind of did the the commons the                                same way                                um we actually started talking about                                inner source at oscon                                in                                                             that was us admitting that we were                                starting to experiment with it                                at the time it was a gutsy thing to do                                because people like me had been saying                                no                                to internal open source for a really                                long time                                because it didn't create more public                                code but                                i came to a point in my consultancy                                after                                                                   i was starting to see                                that we were losing momentum because we                                didn't have                                any more companies looking for                                engagement with open source that could                                get there on their own because they had                                cultural impediments                                i think the situation's a little bit                                better today now that now that                                we've talked about inner source and                                people realize that community building                                is its own art                                learning to collaborate can be done                                inside your company in a way that's also                                additive to the                                to the whole anyway these are the                                lessons that i learned                                at least some of them first of all i                                learned                                that good ideas don't need to die but                                they have to wait their time                                the intersource was actually invented in                                the year                                     but it couldn't work as an                                effort until open source won in the                                minds of the public                                 because it was just too easy to discount                                 it                                 when people came along to you know                                 there's always push back against any                                 change                                 and uh the middle management especially                                 of companies were getting in the way and                                 sometimes                                 the most senior engineers also kind of                                 getting in the way                                 of this forward progress away from                                 excessive ownership culture                                 so it had to wait until open source one                                 and companies got hungry to figure out                                 how to build software                                 in the same way and so you know                                 keep an eye on the good ideas that                                 didn't quite make it over the finish                                 line because you might find them useful                                 again later                                 second thing you are what you measure                                 and what i'm saying there is                                 really you don't want to go overboard on                                 measurement                                 when you're trying to first understand                                 what's going on in your culture and                                 why it's difficult to get people to                                 collaborate when you do your first                                 couple of experiments you you really                                 can't                                 go all in on metrics and if you're in a                                 company where metrics are a big deal                                 this can be a bit of a struggle                                 um when i say you are what you measure                                 you can use which metrics your                                 you're using to push behavior                                 so for instance if you're getting and                                 this happens                                 to everybody at first if people are                                 holding on to their code too long                                 because they're not comfortable                                 giving it over to be read by somebody                                 else there so they're over polishing                                 and then they drop                                                   poor trusted committer who has no time                                 to do a good job of                                 reviewing the code um that's obviously a                                 broken thing                                 you have to convince them to release                                 early and often                                 and one of the ways to do that is                                 announce far and wide that you're going                                 to start measuring number of pull                                 requests and i promise you there'll be a                                 lot more of them                                 and they'll be smaller so                                 metrics can be your friend but you want                                 to wait                                 to apply really deep metrics until you                                 have a good idea of which behaviors                                 you're trying to change                                 next thing change agents are born not                                 made                                 this little girl is about to do a death                                 defying thing                                 and and the the people like her                                 when their children are gonna be                                 reasonable change agents i think                                 um there are a lot of people who want to                                 engage in change agency that have no                                 business doing it because it'll make                                 them miserable                                 as individuals people like to shoot the                                 messenger when you're trying to change                                 things and what i learned was it's                                 possible to mitigate this effect                                 if you educate people about what                                 it is that they need to think about                                 before they                                 push their career in this direction                                 that's helped us                                 find some really hard working                                 serious change agents in the intersource                                 commons                                 and they are some of the people that                                 have stayed involved in the foundation                                 and are helping to grow it                                 because they want to see the change that                                 we've been talking about spread                                 all across engineering and they realize                                 that they need allies                                 but i realized that not everybody who                                 comes through the door of inner source                                 commons is one of those people                                 and that's okay not everybody has to be                                 that but there have to be a few of them                                 and um so i have some methods now for                                 how to tell or how to help people do                                 that assessment                                 and we'll maybe start submitting                                 uh that tutorial again to conferences                                 now that inner source has gained some                                 steam we did it like                                 half a dozen times um a few years ago                                 and it was always really popular but                                 but we should probably start doing it                                 again okay                                 preparation is key to scaling and this                                 is the                                 chinese olympics which had thousands of                                 people doing amazing things                                 but the reason i picked this picture is                                 because this woman                                 looks like if you just saw the stage                                 level of her                                 she looks like she's doing everything on                                 her own but she has thousands of people                                 under her                                 the truth is the kind of people that                                 inner source appeals to                                 are not the kind of people who know how                                 to communicate effectively inside a                                 company typically                                 so we do a little seed experiment and                                 they prove to themselves and to their                                 management that                                 open source is going to or inner source                                 is going to work and in some cases that                                 it's going to be a necessary                                 stepping stone to get to open source                                 which is the whole reason i started                                 talking about it                                 but then somebody in the upper                                 management will say this is a great idea                                 thank you for showing us how it's done                                 now tell everybody else in the company                                 how to do it                                 and those people that originally got                                 interested in this method go oh                                 or sometimes they might say in asked                                 like they're not ready                                 for for that kind of communication they                                 don't have the chops                                 that's not what they're good at so what                                 i advise companies                                 do is get communicators involved and                                 interested in inner source within the                                 company as soon as it's showing promise                                 maybe even while the first seat is being                                 set up                                 so that they can start looking for the                                 storyline                                 that's going to be compelling throughout                                 the whole organization because that is                                 the hardest thing to do                                 and it is different per culture steve                                 jobs knew how to do that for his team                                 building the mac but it didn't wouldn't                                 have worked for everybody at apple                                 he was doing a special thing the problem                                 is                                 the people that want to do inner source                                 tend to be the special people                                 and then they have to infect the rest of                                 the company with                                 the success of this endeavor russ                                 rutledge who you saw earlier                                 is super good at figuring out what value                                 was just created                                 in whatever stage of the process he's at                                 and then broadcasting that back to                                 management                                 but that's not the same as getting every                                 engineer on                                 your side and he's had to figure out                                 ways to do that within his culture too                                 so this is a big lesson preparation is                                 the key to scaling you've got to start                                 early                                 if you're expecting the whole company to                                 do this                                 and then my last big takeaway for this                                 talk although i have some illustrative                                 points still in                                 future slides is just like open source                                 inner source and air source commons is                                 made out of people                                 these are people at the last summit that                                 we did if you look carefully you'll see                                 an awful lot of asian faces that's                                 because the summit was                                 pointed towards um asia pacific and                                 you know down in a time zone that was                                 comfortable for that part of the world                                 um it was the largest summit we've had                                 so far more than a thousand people                                 attended this is just a little piece of                                 that                                 but i have learned a lot in my whole                                 open source career                                 that i've been applying to this issue of                                 inner sources people and these are                                 things that any                                 open source effort could could benefit                                 from as well so i'll go through them                                 quickly                                 um so the first one is as a leader                                 you've got to check your ego at the door                                 i                                 i worked for                                                             as a personification of the future of                                 open source                                 there were a handful of us that traveled                                 around the world                                 talking to governments and companies and                                 schools                                 individuals to push this idea of the                                 future of open source                                 that's not the only piece of the puzzle                                 that got open source over the line but                                 it was a big piece of the puzzle i think                                 and and that was about pushing ego                                 but to build a community that you hope                                 will                                 will last after you're done because i'll                                 retire at some point coming up here                                 um you have to do a different thing you                                 have to give                                 everybody ownership in the thing that                                 you're talking about and this is                                 you know all good maintainers know this                                 there's a few bad maintainers that are                                 having to learn this now                                 because of the emphasis on diversity and                                 inclusion right now                                 but it's really important and this is a                                 lesson i'm still learning i'm not                                 claiming to be good at this                                 but i'm saying that if i wasn't                                 interested in doing this i don't think                                 inner source comments would have gotten                                 very far                                 i have various lieutenants that that                                 we've                                 you know given more responsibility to                                 because they've shown both aptitude and                                 interest                                 and that's how you grow community                                 is you give away responsibility as much                                 as you can                                 and try to be you know a reasonably                                 benign                                 leader and treat everybody the same                                 treat everybody equally and kindly so                                 that's the first thing                                 the second thing is open source and                                 inner source are both                                 enlightened self-interest endeavors if                                 it's not                                 making the people that are your                                 practitioners feel like they're getting                                 somewhere                                 then they're not going to stick around                                 so you have to help them grow their                                 careers                                 for inner source commons we did a lot of                                 focus early on                                 on training people how to um                                 speak effectively how to write a talk                                 quickly i wrote this talk very quickly                                 and how to speak effectively about about                                 the thing and now we                                 pick them out of the crowd and say we'd                                 like to hear you talk about this at the                                 next summit                                 people who have never given a talk at                                 the scale that we're talking about                                 and then we coach them to help them get                                 through i                                 we also for a long time we taught how to                                 write                                 a ignite talk which is a                                 five-minute format talk sort of like a                                 lightning talk but the slide                                 self-advance                                 so invest in people's careers i spend a                                 lot of time mentoring                                 people that reach out to me on                                 intersource commons to answer questions                                 about this                                 stuff and i refer them as much as i can                                 in the direction that they want to go if                                 they need to meet somebody to get there                                 i try to make that happen                                 so remember enlightened self-interest is                                 key and help them                                 and then last and we have rest distinct                                 thank for the phrasing of this                                 praise all contributions we try                                 very hard to be welcoming when people                                 show up at inner source commons                                 and we try very hard to recognize every                                 contribution                                 georg who is the vice president of the                                 of the board and i                                 as president do a talk at every summit                                 where we go over the major contributions                                 that people have made                                 in the last since the last summit we've                                 had some amazing contributions all of                                 our                                 training materials have been already                                 translated into multiple languages by                                 by volunteers um we just had a guy spend                                 his christmas vacation redoing our                                 website because he felt like it was time                                 you know so praises really effective at                                 getting people to stay                                 engaged and continue to move forward                                 um so i think the future's really bright                                 for inner source                                 i think that it is a form of piracy in a                                 way because it's                                 taking old ownership culture out of the                                 picture it's                                 it's calling it out for what it is which                                 is an old-fashioned way to do things                                 it's like a monarchy                                 we need to go for a more um                                 generalized and and everybody's in the                                 boat together                                 kind of uh approach so that all the                                 votes will rise                                 and um that's what i have to say and i                                 will go over to the breakout room now if                                 anybody wants to                                 hear me talk some more um happy to do                                 that                                 and thank you again so much foss                                 backstage for a
