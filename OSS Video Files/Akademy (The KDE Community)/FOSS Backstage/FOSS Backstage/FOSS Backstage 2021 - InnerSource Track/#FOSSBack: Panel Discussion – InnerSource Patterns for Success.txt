	                              hi                               so um let's get started we're going to                               be talking in this session                               about various various patterns that we                               have found useful and a bit about the                               patterns project                               and then we're also going to talk about                               some things that                               aren't patterns yet but we'd like to                                come find some patterns to solve them i                                hope                                and i've just captured a picture for                                twitter let's get going                                wait you should have announced it before                                so um                                daniel hello i think i think you've been                                around the longest of this merry band                                what is it what what is your single                                favorite pattern if you had to pick one                                um so a pattern by the way                                just as an interaction right it's a set                                of proven solutions to existing problems                                and                                then there is this community at the                                inner source commons which is inner                                source patterns                                and my favorite one and there are there                                are several of them                                indeed i have the list now in front of                                me i would say after                                certain experiences with different                                companies and so on                                i would go for the trusted committer                                because this                                role is so so important like having                                first people that they only have free                                taxes and then others that they have                                read and write access                                that's that's important because then the                                trusted committer is the one                                helping to to have this inner source way                                of working                                in the right way proposing ways of                                working                                style guides uh mentoring people                                newcomers uh helping them to you know                                learn how to do properly called review                                etc so trusted committer                                that's my one excellent                                thank you so much i usually take that                                one                                okay russ do you have a favorite pattern                                yeah thanks denise and uh i'll do my                                best uh pirate talk since i don't have                                the pirate attire                                uh so uh our uh denise me favorite                                pattern                                uh be the inner source portal pattern                                uh all right so                                uh the the inner source portal uh                                pattern is about                                discoverability uh i i love it                                uh because uh what the inner source                                portal pattern says                                is to create a centralized listing of                                all                                uh inner source projects of the company                                that people can opt into                                oftentimes by checking in some metadata                                into their code repository                                uh indicating that that this repository                                is open for inner source contributions                                and then through an automated process                                all the repositories that                                check that in can be displayed in a nice                                a nice ui                                for discovery it's so important because                                for inner source to have the impact that                                we want it to have                                we need to enable people that don't                                already know each other                                to find each other where they have some                                shared concern around a shared project                                and the inner source portal pattern has                                worked at multiple companies                                for that discovery and there's even                                recently in the inner source commons                                there's been a company that is                                open sourced uh their implementation of                                inner source portal which is also                                very exciting so the inner source portal                                pattern be me favorite pattern denise                                good job all right                                wolfgang you got a pattern in mind ah                                russ your pattern is not a feeble one                                but i have to spy with capitan                                favorite pattern be the trusted                                committer as well                                simply because it well i don't know                                 they're all important but i think this                                 one is                                 it's the central role i have to admit we                                 call it                                 at daimler we call it maintainer um                                 it's basically the same thing i know you                                 can talk about                                 what to call it but yeah i mean it                                 you know these people are responsible                                 for the repository they                                 reject or or uh accept                                 the contributions they have to talk to                                 people they have to you know be nice if                                 they reject                                 one you know welcome all contributions                                 right ross                                 and uh so yeah i'll follow with                                 capitan                                 [Laughter]                                 okay um and i'm gonna talk about one                                 myself                                 and i i'm gonna go a different way                                 um i think my favorite pattern and it's                                 because it's been so useful to me in my                                 career                                 is what we call outside in marketing                                 so outside in marketing is the idea                                 that sometimes when you're a change                                 agent                                 it's hard enough just to explain this                                 desired state and get people to see the                                 vision you're talking about                                 almost always you are dodging                                 cannonballs                                 right i always tell the story about                                 being in sun                                 when open source was a new thing and                                 somebody tried to fire me every quarter                                 i managed to survive for six years but i                                 got really good at avoiding those                                 cannonballs right                                 one of the ways that i got around that                                 was essentially                                 by taking my career into my own hands                                 and getting the public to                                 show son how                                 what the way they were messaging the way                                 they were thinking about the future                                 was not what people wanted to hear                                 it wasn't satisfying the market so there                                 was a shift going on                                 in those years around trying to get                                 the the message that you gave first of                                 all not to be segmented                                 because the internet means that                                 everybody can see every message that                                 you're giving                                 and if they're not exactly in sync it's                                 kind of embarrassing but that was                                 that was new news to most of the                                 marketers that were working at sun at                                 that time                                 in the case of me i got very adept                                 at accurately stating whatever the                                 corporate policy was                                 and then i would take a step to the                                 right or left on the stage                                 and i would say but this is what i think                                 and what i thought was not always in                                 perfect agreement with whatever the                                 market plan was                                 and then i'd go back and circle back in                                 my talk                                 and re-emphasize that they have reasons                                 for their position                                 but it gave this it gave the internal                                 people an opportunity to see the                                 different reaction                                 that the massage message versus an                                 authentic message from a practitioner                                 how those two landed in people's ears                                 it's always better to have the public                                 or the audience tell the company                                 rather than you having to carry that                                 message as an individual because you are                                 a target                                 it's easy to target you it's much harder                                 to target                                 everybody else right but it does take a                                 certain kind                                 of risk appetite                                 to pull this off um and so i'm just                                 gonna say                                 it's it's one of those caveat patterns                                 uh that                                 that maybe isn't for everyone                                 yeah we should call you captain                                 cannonball dodging cooper                                 children in america play this game                                 called dodgeball                                 at least we used to did you play it russ                                 oh yeah dodgeball is great                                 yeah dodgeball's a real game they have                                 these nice rubber cannon balls                                 yeah the kids throw at each other well                                 the best dodge ball is played on                                 trampolines                                 and sometimes when you're a change agent                                 and as a company that's kind of what it                                 feels like you're you're                                 not only dodgeball but dodgeball on on                                 trampolines and uh                                 yeah i think what you say is is is true                                 but i've                                 i've found uh like you that the the                                 rewards are                                 are worth it in being a and being a                                 change agent it was a real inner                                 satisfaction i think it's one of the                                 things that draws me to                                 inner source is it's not only a                                 wonderful way to                                 get things done it's a wonderful way to                                 live as a person                                 like i'm living in my career at least                                 eight hours a day if not more and so are                                 all my peers it's a significant portion                                 of our life                                 and inner source is just a way to take                                 that portion of our life and                                 make it so much happier through uh                                 enabling and empowering                                 individual engineers you know through                                 being able to cross contribute it's                                 it's just a wonderful thing so it's                                 worth the cannonball dodging that it                                 that it may bring                                 i agree this is this authenticity once                                 you've had it                                 you can't go back and and open says that                                 too                                 uh once engineers have really worked in                                 open source they don't want to go back                                 to working in the in the salt mines                                 right right so right right and that's a                                 good thing                                 because you get better contribution out                                 of them                                 yeah so excellent all right                                 so now let's talk a bit more about                                 um challenges which was going to be our                                 second thing to talk about                                 so um tell me mateys                                 what's the hardest thing you've had to                                 deal with in in                                 trying to implement inner source uh                                 either at somebody's company                                 or at your own company and we'll go the                                 other way                                 well if you're first                                 well i'm trying to think what was the                                 hardest                                 because that i tell you there are many                                 shallows                                 and uh i said that in my talk many legal                                 shallows you know because i mean see on                                 the one side you know                                 legal people need to make sure that                                 everything is okay                                 and they have to that's their job but                                 they shouldn't                                 you know prevent innovation and now                                 engineers                                 want to drive forward innovation but                                 they can't do that at the                                 expense of the company you know to                                 threaten the company so it's always a                                 sort of                                 a struggle back and forth you know and                                 um                                 so i have learned a lot of things about                                 legal issues                                 that i wasn't aware of existed of tax                                 issues                                 right um you know transfer pricing and                                 taxes                                 and uh i think our legal and governance                                 people have learned a lot about                                 engineers you know because at the very                                 beginning of our                                 open source journey they they you know                                 this is kind of funny because the you                                 know the legal people said                                 you want to do what you want to give                                 away                                 software for free that we you know                                 created in our company                                 on our dime you want to give that away                                 for free                                 you you're not serious right and uh                                 then you know we they had nothing to do                                 with open source before you had no idea                                 right                                 right and so we explained it to them we                                 sat down and talked and explained to                                 them                                 you know and after what i said so you're                                 actually serious right you really want                                 to do this                                 and and so yes but then you know then                                 they understood the reasons why                                 so so i'll say this i guess                                 getting the you know the former                                 old world and old world thinking                                 getting that towards the new thinking                                 the open                                 and inner source way of thinking as that                                 i think was the hardest part to overcome                                 at first                                 you know and in inner source as well                                 because formally you know project teams                                 were                                 isolated we're doing and you cannot see                                 our code                                 right and we're not helping you to write                                 your code and you know that kind of                                 thinking                                 i think all details aside but that was                                 the hardest part to overcome to get the                                 mind check mind                                 the change in mindset going to start                                 that path                                 yeah that totally resonates with me                                 i'm and i'm betting with the rest of the                                 panel                                 that's thank you that's a really good                                 one okay                                 um let's see let's get daniel to speak                                 second                                 oh so then i go next so definitely                                 with with uh wolfgang like legal and                                 taxes that's that's kind of a really                                 new world a new pirate world that we                                 need to                                 deal with and do some hacking there and                                 it's about converting right the lawyers                                 and all the legal stuff and                                 they are blockers from blockers to                                 facilitators right so how how to move                                 them from uh                                 no no you are not doing this to                                 something like well you are                                 helping the organization to move forward                                 so how how can we work all together                                 um what i've seen is that once you                                 remove this                                 barrier from the discussion the budget                                 or the money or the taxes or so then                                 things are much much                                 simpler just one thing uh but but i                                 would go for for another challenge and                                 and this is this is basically based on                                 experience talking to people at the at                                 the inner source common right                                 and and this is about when companies                                 are ready to go to start an inner source                                 journey and                                 and these these needs of uh                                 alignment from the chief level right                                 from people                                 uh uh after making decisions and driving                                 the organization to                                 to the right path and then at the same                                 time                                 developers that they feel that they                                 should be working in a different way                                 with with other type of tools                                 processes and so on so the first time i                                 heard about this and that was very very                                 true was by                                 denise and celina and some more people                                 from the from the community right                                 it's it's the so-called air cover on                                 ground cover                                 so we need both worlds she has to keep                                 advancing things right so we need                                 but then he said before right about the                                 outside marketing so it's about you need                                 certain support from the                                 from the upper management but then at                                 the same time you need                                 ambassadors that that help drive all of                                 this                                 um and i would like to to bring perhaps                                 kind of a new pattern which is                                 not not only outside marketing but                                 inside marketing with the goal of                                 giving the talk and the the states to                                 people the people within the corporation                                 saying hey we are doing this we are                                 working in this way                                 and this is our view of how we should be                                 working right                                 and that's another challenge which is                                 and then i will talk about the                                 challenges here                                 if you love me which is uh                                 being afraid of failing sometimes                                 failing is not something that can happen                                 in certain corporations                                 and that's something that we need all to                                 learn because if we are trying to foster                                 innovation for instance with inner                                 source                                 we need to allow people to fail at some                                 point because they                                 we we will learn probably faster if we                                 are all failing right at some point                                 so that's my thing                                 yeah it's hard and this is this is                                 something that's very hard to explain to                                 management                                 but it we have seen it at inner source                                 commons that if you're willing to                                 share your failures with the rest of the                                 inner source community                                 everybody benefits and you know i've                                 told you guys many times that one of my                                 dreams for inner source commons was that                                 it would trick                                 companies that weren't yet doing open                                 source into doing that                                 through the means of intersource because                                 except for                                 you know github gitlab and atlassian                                 it's nobody's secret sauce                                 it should be everybody's everybody's                                 common practice                                 right and um that one of the things that                                 we really believe in                                 is sharing both successes and failures                                 and that's why we have anti-patterns                                 in the pattern repository as well so                                 thank you very much for that daniel                                 now russ you got one uh yeah i have                                 several uh challenges and i i think it's                                 in the same                                 uh uh a thrust of what we heard from                                 wolf earlier uh but expanded a little                                 bit                                 i think within a corporation uh usually                                 there's                                 uh certain people that are responsible                                 for one aspect of that corporation                                 running well                                 and wolf you gave one of them which is                                 you know tax and and legal                                 and that person's job is to make sure                                 that the you know tax and legal                                 things work well you know so as they                                 pursue                                 their job they're wondering how does                                 inner source relate to this                                 and it's a model that's unfamiliar it                                 immediately raises questions                                 and it's it's something that's new that                                 you know hasn't necessarily proven out                                 on a large scale that they've been able                                 to see before                                 and i see that that same aspect happen                                 in other areas where people are                                 responsible for one singular part of the                                 company                                 and the the two that i'll i'll talk                                 about our                                 security and then uh you know our                                 functional business leaders                                 and when when you bring a concept like                                 inner source it talks about                                 you know broad collaboration people some                                 degree                                 kind of you know having some some agency                                 about                                 about where they spend their time and                                 where their code goes as a functional                                 business leader you know i'm rightfully                                 i might rightfully wonder how is that                                 going to affect my ability to deliver                                 what my technology org is committed to                                 the to the business                                 and that's a challenge i'm still working                                 on                                 on overcoming you know i'm aiming to                                 show                                 through data that we can prove you know                                 correlation and causation between inner                                 source behavior and then throughput                                 of business deliverables but uh thus far                                 the the growth that i've had has been uh                                 more in                                 kind of people that feel it in their gut                                 or there's                                 enough anecdotes or stories of how this                                 is helpful that people kind of get it                                 and make space for that                                 and that's taken the efforts that i'm at                                 you know a long way you know i work                                 you know literally with thousands of                                 people that are engaged in                                 in collaborative behavior at nike and                                 inner source                                 but to really kind of have it kind of                                 take over                                 and be the way that normal work happens                                 you know reaching that scale i think is                                 going to require a greater                                 ability to articulate uh and articulate                                 through data                                 and not just anecdote and testimonial                                 you know the of the benefits that we all                                 feel of                                 of inner source so there's that and then                                 uh security i think is interesting too                                 you know we've had                                 conversations it's like you know what                                 you want everyone at the company to be                                 able to see this the source code                                 you know what is that you know                                 you know secure by default it says okay                                 we should have principal least privilege                                 who really needs to see it and when i                                 come back and say well everyone needs to                                 see it                                 you know of course uh there's a you know                                 really                                 uh and uh when you think about someone                                 whose job it is to                                 to keep assets of the company secure i                                 think they're rightfully wondering                                 how inner source plays plays against                                 that so in                                 in both of those i think in addition to                                 tax it's it's interesting when you have                                 someone that's                                 responsible for a singular part of the                                 business                                 and then intersource comes in they're                                 wondering how inner sorts relates to it                                 and since inner source is so so                                 fundamental so transformative which is                                 why it's so powerful                                 it also means it touches up against all                                 of these people                                 in their particular area and those are                                 two uh where i think there's been a                                 challenge but also clear                                 uh clear ways ways forward                                 yeah so you guys picked really good ones                                 good challenges                                 um i will say that i mean i'm older than                                 all of you i've been                                 in this industry a long time now and                                 what i can see                                 is a decided trend                                 in the direction i think the whole                                 industry works in pendulums some of you                                 heard my pendulum theory                                 we go to extremes right centralized                                 decentralized as                                 a common one but there are others                                 and one of them is we place                                 the power in the hands of the makers                                 where we place the power in the hands of                                 the bean counters                                 and i'm i'm using that people who work                                 as lawyers and accountants                                 you know that sounds pejorative but i'm                                 just trying to come up with a way to say                                 not the people actually directly making                                 the stuff                                 that all of the back office and i think                                 to the extent                                 that we go in the industry to an extreme                                 in the direction                                 of of allowing administration to rule                                 how things are done                                 we kill off a lot of the joy of doing                                 the work                                 i had the privilege to work for both                                 apple and sun microsystems                                 both of those companies were more than                                 willing to innovate                                 more than willing to come up with                                 interesting new                                 and then figure out how to make it a                                 business                                 and i also worked for intel who had a                                 lot of resources a lot of smart people                                 and a lot of ways to look at innovation                                 but                                 nine times out of ten they would take an                                 innovative idea                                 to understand it they would explore it                                 but they would never actually go                                 into the business of doing that work                                 because they were so nervous about                                 triggering antitrust and if you look at                                 intel today                                 they spent a lot of time focusing on a                                 very narrow expertise which is they are                                 not they have now lost the plot                                 a big company like that right so                                 i think that companies do well to try to                                 allow                                 innovation and not stifle it and allow                                 original thought and in pushing forward                                 against                                 the desire for everything to all the                                 beans to be counted                                 um tim o'reilly said it to us                                          ago when open source was new he said                                 the secret to happiness is create more                                 value than you monetize                                 leave some stuff on the table give                                 people an opportunity                                 to go there especially the really                                 creative people in your company                                 and i mean that's that's what may                                 we're we're not cogs in a wheel                                 engineers are not cogs in a wheel                                 we're painters we're artists we're                                 pirates                                 we need to be able to squash and buckle                                 and that is frightening to some people                                 but what the triumph of open source                                 has companies that would not normally                                 look in this direction                                 trying to figure out how to walk that                                 plank if you will                                 between business as usual                                 and losing any hope of future                                 you know growth right                                 and i think that um more and more we've                                 seen the rising tide of inner source                                 it's clearly on people's minds and we                                 have an opportunity                                 to help some of us some of the poor                                 lovers that are working in these salt                                 mines to get on the boats with us                                 right so thank you guys i think that                                 we're just about out of time                                 you
