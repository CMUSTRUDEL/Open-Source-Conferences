Title: #FOSSBack: Wolfgang Gehring - The FOSS Manifesto at Daimler TSS
Publication date: 2021-03-02
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 - InnerSource Track
Description: 
	Investing in Open Source Software means to go beyond simply using it – it means to become an active member of the Open Source community. But how do we get there as a whole IT company? We decided that if we are going to take Open Source seriously, this needs to become deeply ingrained in the company’s and its employees’ “DNA” and in the way in which we create software.

This is why and how we created the TSS FOSS Manifesto. The Manifesto is a set of guidelines which send our employees on their Open Source mission while having the company back them up. It is now a key pillar in how we become part of the Open Source movement, and we thus would like to share it with the rest of the world. In this talk, I want to present our Manifesto, the therein contained principles to drive forward the cultural change at Daimler TSS (and actually, perhaps all of Daimler), and their importance for modern IT companies.

open source                               i sure hope you'll be fine and things                               are just                               jolly roger i kind of miss the times                               when us pirates just had eye patches                               meh so i would like to share a story                                with you                                a tale of adventure of treasure                                and betrayal so                                it goes like this here once upon a time                                a fine crew of software developers                                they be working for daimler tss which is                                a                                                                              you know an i.t subsidiary of daimler                                who in turn is a builder of most                                formidable vessels which                                roam the waters of the world                                well mostly land actually but                                let's not need to pick here okay                                so these developers they lived quite                                happily                                and were successful in their endeavors                                to hide                                and find again nuggets of                                gold in their programs                                for many years these developers had been                                roaming the waters which were close to                                their home port                                successfully and their bounties were                                handsome                                but they grew more and more inquisitive                                as is a pirate developer's duty                                and they became more and more                                anxious to go out and explore                                the seven seas of inner source                                and open source                                well okay the two seas                                really but they're really really                                vast seas so they kind of should count                                as                                seven okay                                however there were many barriers                                in their ways to these seas the seas can                                be                                treacherous and full of legal                                shallows were they even                                allowed to sail these waters                                what are the rules of engagement                                you know even pirates have walls and                                a code of honor okay                                and what would the pirates high command                                and supreme                                admiralty say to this                                so they set out on their journey to                                answer these questions                                and um i'm going to cut a bit short here                                because this is                                actually kind of a long story in itself                                so in the end the high command was                                convinced                                that it was the right thing to do and in                                the best                                interest of everyone to indeed                                sail the seas of inner source and open                                source                                and they got together and sealed                                the deal they wrote up on the                                finest parchment a letter of mark                                that would lay the foundation of all                                inner                                and open source explorations to come                                they called it the foss                                manifesto                                a jester once called it the manifosto                                it's actually not so bad i kind of like                                it so                                light shown upon this fine document                                when it was signed and sealed                                and i happen to have it here                                with me and i would like to show it to                                you                                you see when you introduce new rules                                the challenge is that you want everyone                                to know about it                                and so it is a good idea to take these                                new rules                                to the market square of your pirates                                nest a                                company and read them                                out loud so                                let's open it and                                let's see                                [Music]                                so let's see um i'm going to deviate                                from the pirate team here for a moment                                 our dimer tss foss manifesto                                 has three parts to it uh the first one                                 here                                 is a preamble in order to sort of                                 set the stage to give the manifesto                                 a solemn note and to show                                 that the high command you know the board                                 of management                                 uh and our internal foss                                 competence group hearing called uh the                                 house of foss                                 you know that's sort of like uh the foss                                 programs office if you will                                 uh that these are fully committed to the                                 foss                                 manifesto it                                 also states the goals the overall goals                                 of the manifesto for example that we                                 want to be                                 active members of the open source                                 community                                 so i'm going to not going to read it out                                 word by word to you because i guess you                                 can read it for yourself                                 so if um by the looks of it if this                                 looks a little bit similar to you                                 then uh perhaps you have seen and read                                 the treaty on the european union the                                 lisbon treaty on the european union                                 i mean who hasn't right um this is                                 a little bit similar just you know from                                 the big wording                                 but make no mistake the purpose of the                                 preamble is                                 not just to be pretty words um                                 a change a big change in it in a company                                 requires                                 well time for one right                                 and uh the bigger the company the more                                 time it requires                                 and for two a change is always most                                 successful                                 if it is supported by senior management                                 and by the crew if it if only the crew                                 wanted                                 then it may be difficult to get it                                 through                                 and if only senior management wanted                                 they may have the power to sort of push                                 it but if the people are not convinced                                 it probably won't be very successful                                 right okay so that's why the preamble                                 here is important and that's why it                                 shows                                 look this comes from the people at the                                 base                                 and by management is fully backed up by                                 management and they support it as well                                 all right preamble now                                 the next two parts are the company's                                 principles                                 and the employees principles so                                 here first the company principles                                 so a lot of times our employees are                                 still a bit                                 uncertain if they are allowed to have                                 their open source their own open source                                 projects                                 if they are allowed to contribute to                                 other open source projects                                 and if they can do inner source as well                                 with you know parts of the company that                                 are                                 somewhere completely different somewhere                                 else different department                                 because that hasn't always been the case                                 that you were allowed to do open source                                 event source                                 for the past so for various reasons                                 right so the intention of the company                                 principles here                                 is not only to show the employees that                                 they're indeed                                 allowed to do it but actually                                 sends them on a mission to do exactly                                 that                                 so uh let's take a closer look                                 the first principle encourages employees                                 to use                                 contribute to and create projects                                 both in inner and open source endeavors                                 now a lot of times                                 employees will tell you yeah that's all                                 fine and well but i have to work                                 productively in my customer project                                 i don't have the time to work on open                                 oriented source                                 on site right even though it may be                                 related to my work                                 so it is the purpose of principle number                                 two here                                 to let the employees know that it                                 actually is okay for them                                 to take the time to work on such                                 projects as well                                 now principle number three lets the                                 employees know                                 that they are supposed to learn and grow                                 with foss                                 take the time to do so you know attend                                 online courses or                                 real real courses when that is possible                                 again                                 for example attend conferences and um                                 even                                 give a talk perhaps right so                                 principle number four strives to promote                                 visibility                                 for example through active membership                                 and participation in                                 open source foundations so at daimler                                 tss                                 we are for example founding member of                                 the eclipse foundation europe                                 yay which you know i think is really                                 cool it's really cool that the eclipse                                 foundation has moved to europe for one                                 and it's really cool that we got the                                 opportunity to be                                 a part of it from the beginning as                                 founding members                                 awesome so we're also a member of the                                 linux foundation                                 and a couple more so and now                                 lastly principle number five is to state                                 that we shall support                                 our mothership daimler in its foss                                 endeavors as well                                 you know that is sort of our main

company principles                                 let's go one further                                 look at the principles from an employee                                 point of view so they basically ask of                                 an employee to become                                 more active in the foss world and to                                 think                                 foss first so principle number one                                 says please look for alternatives in                                 inner and open source first                                 before you write code for which there                                 already is a nice solution out there                                 that is not necessary wasting time
