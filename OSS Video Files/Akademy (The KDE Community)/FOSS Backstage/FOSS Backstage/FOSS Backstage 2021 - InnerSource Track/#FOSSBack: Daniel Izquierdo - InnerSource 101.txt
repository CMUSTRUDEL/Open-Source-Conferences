	                              thank you thank you very much how are                               you all                               uh hope you are all safe sound at home                               and i'm really glad and happy to be here                               to give this this introduction to                               two inner source so this is part of a                               two hour session so i hope you you enjoy                               this and well                               hope you have some really great great                                questions                                so let's start from the very beginning                                what is inner source                                so the basic definition here is that                                inner source is the use of open source                                best practices uh for software                                development within the confines of an                                organization so it's about bringing                                all of this way of working internally i                                mean externally in open source in terms                                of cultural approach processes                                tools etc into the way software is                                developed internally                                at corporations and why is this                                uh why is this necessary why is this                                inner source                                so important nowadays so the point is                                that if we think about how large                                corporations are working                                nowadays this is this is what we see                                those are silos and and basically what                                happens is that we have silos of                                development                                styles of knowledge that are seen once                                and again in different geographical                                distributions right                                so basically large corporations are                                producing once and again the same                                software                                or pretty similar software um if we look                                around and we see okay who else is                                dealing with this issue basically open                                source communities open source projects                                have been producing really great quality                                software for the last years                                and so this is where large corporations                                should learn from right                                some benefits um so if we have more eyes                                looking at the code basically we are                                spreading the knowledge of what what                                else others are doing                                we can increase the code quality because                                we are going through certain code review                                processes                                or we are having some continuous                                integration or even continuous delivery                                right                                of course if there are more people                                joining we are                                scaling our our teams we are scaling our                                uh development teams we are decreasing                                our time to market                                first because we are faster doing                                development we have more hands and then                                we have more eyes having a                                having a look at it then it's all about                                innovation so developers let's say are                                empowered                                to to try things to fail it's very                                important to fail indeed to see                                hey what's going on here i i would like                                to try this new technology which is                                uh really useful to solve this problem                                and disorder right                                and somehow we are in that way                                decreasing the development and                                maintenance cost because we are                                doing things as automating stuff we are                                automating processes right so we are                                using the tools that we are used to                                to manage in in open source and of                                course if we have                                uh developers solving problems if we                                have developers                                dealing with engineering and perhaps                                even forgetting about bureaucracy and                                paperwork                                we have higher engagement right                                that's from the organization point of                                view employees benefits                                um we won't have only people dealing                                with technology                                in a daily basis we don't have we don't                                want to have people that are just                                executing right                                we want people to think about what they                                are doing and in this way we are                                increasing the                                let's say that option of other skills                                soft skills perhaps because                                 developers need to focus on teaching                                 others                                 developers need to spend certain time                                 building even internal communities and                                 so on so there are other skills right                                 that                                 we can uh we can improve ourselves as                                 engineers                                 we we will have more dynamic                                 environments again we go for the                                 for this idea of innovation as we are                                 letting others to innovate                                 we are just trying things right and we                                 are developers we we like to solve                                 problems so                                 we reach a point in time where we are                                 empowering ourselves to do things                                 right so we are allowing developers to                                 to make those decisions and                                 hey stop here inner source is not open                                 source and                                 yeah that's true but let's keep going in                                 the talk                                 so there are similar principles so we                                 are talking about a cultural change                                 right so we                                 we are moving from ways of developing                                 and producing knowledge                                 that we are hiding something and then i                                 have i have certain                                 certain power right into a model where                                 if we                                 share knowledge then we can increase our                                 merits in front of the rest of the                                 people so we are we are                                 we are walking that path and somehow and                                 for this we need                                 uh we need certain improvements right so                                 we need to                                 have open communication and if we have                                 this open communication that means a                                 certain level of transparency because                                 that communication                                 can be reached out by anyone in the                                 community um                                 if we have uh that transparency we'll                                 see that there is certain collaboration                                 right so                                 people have opinions and people as they                                 have opinions they will go to the main                                 list to the                                 uh any communication channel we have                                 internally will say hey                                 i have this idea here what if right if                                 we start fostering this collaboration                                 then we are what we are doing in the end                                 is creating communities and then at the                                 very end we have this concept of                                 meritocracy                                 this is not this is not my idea this is                                 probably something that sounds familiar                                 to you which is                                 based on the apache way and by the                                 apache silver foundation of course                                 and this is something that open source                                 is used to work in certain ways but                                 internal development or corporations                                 they are not that used to working this                                 way                                 so we have certain principles and then                                 we have our own path                                 and this is a really kind of quick piece                                 of advice right                                 so we may we may deal with tools we may                                 deal with processes we may deal with                                 people and culture in general                                 but the the general path or recommended                                 path is to start                                 first with people and culture just                                 because they are                                 uh they don't feel comfortable perhaps                                 because people don't feel                                 empowered to do certain things and then                                 once we                                 all think that we are behaving in a                                 certain                                 in a certain culture way then we can                                 start dealing with the process improving                                 the process                                 starting with code review processes how                                 to review each other you know                                 these things make us may bring certain                                 friction into development teams                                 and that's why it's so important to                                 first                                 think hey we are doing this all together                                 we are a team we need to move forward                                 right and then at the very end we have                                 the tools                                 so technology is probably the first                                 thing we think of but                                 probably is kind of the very last thing                                 that we need to think of when dealing                                 with inner source                                 and in general when working in open                                 source right open source is about people                                 it's not                                 it's about technology as we are                                 producing some piece of software right                                 but it's mainly about communities and                                 people like creating networks and so on                                 um so now let's go up to this point                                 let's imagine the following scenario so                                 let's imagine that we have all of the                                 developers in a corporation                                 and they all know how to produce how to                                 collaborate                                 internally in in this first case but in                                 a collaborative way using modern tools                                 code review continuous integration etc                                 etc and                                 they all feel comfortable so they are                                 working in a more open source way                                 how far are we now to effectively                                 contribute to open source so this is how                                 i see this                                 this is probably uh                                 we are really really close just a click                                 away to say and now we can produce open                                 source because if we think how open                                 source is produced nowadays                                 um at least internally in corporations                                 we need to go                                 third we need to go through uh certain                                 steps like security legal marketing et                                 cetera et cetera but what if we have                                 the source code the community the people                                 with the necessary skills ready to go                                 so we are this close if if we have inner                                 source right                                 um so inner source is not easy it's                                 mainly a cultural change as i mentioned                                 but we are not alone so please go to the                                 inner source commands                                 uh the goal here in the community and                                 this is an open community we are working                                 in an open source way                                 um we are producing pieces of knowledge                                 that you can you can reuse there is a                                 youtube channel we have some links at                                 the end                                 so we are we are establishing a body of                                 knowledge and we are educating                                 individuals commercial and non-profit                                 organizations                                 about the successful adoption of inner                                 sources best practices so this is the                                 mission of the                                 of the of the foundation let's say and                                 then there is one rule                                 only one rule and this means that and                                 this is why                                 the reason for this is that we try to                                 create safe environments so the                                 goal is we all meet there as a coming                                 from different companies but we don't                                 like bad prayers right so                                 chat from house rule is well i can use

  we all feel comfortable sharing                                 information                                 some uh preferences there are some                                 documents that you can
