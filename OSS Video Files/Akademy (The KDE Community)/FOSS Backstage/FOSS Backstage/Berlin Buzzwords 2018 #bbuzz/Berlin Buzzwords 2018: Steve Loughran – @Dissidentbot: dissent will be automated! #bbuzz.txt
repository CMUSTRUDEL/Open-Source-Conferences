Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2018: Steve Loughran â€“ @Dissidentbot: dissent will be automated! #bbuzz

Description: 
	Taking my lead from the (alleged) Russian participation in the 2016 US election, my contribution to the 2017 UK general election was @dissidentbot. This is 500 lines of ruby code running on a raspberry pi and tasked with heckling UK politicians via Twitter. As such it provided a valuable contribution to the democratic debate. While Twitter has not yet identified @Dissidentbot as actively interfering with the UK election, I am confident its few hundreds of tweets helped shape the outcome.

This talk looks at the engineering aspects of the project, the production experience such as Twitter's spam blocking algorithms, runaway-reply-loops, and the challenge of generating new content.

More important are the social and ethical aspects. Twitter has changed the nature of communication between politicians and the electorate, sometimes for the better, but sadly, sometimes not. Does @Dissidentbot improve the communications by giving us an immediate right to respond with our own message? Or does it worsen the online discourse which it's clear is shaping referendums and elections.

Most critically: the fact that a ruby script randomly picking phrases can become an active participant in the online debate of an election is not a good sign for a functional democracy.

	                              hi everyone I'm Steve Loughran as people                               have said I normally work on the deep                               stuff this was something I did in my                               spare time last year                               it's called distant BOTS it is up and                               running if you're running Twitter you                               can tweet to outdistance bots and it may                               actually reply to you right now okay and                               the codes are there for you to play with                                so what is this bot it was a small robot                                I created a Twitter account in January                                                                                                       discovered that politicians were                                prepared to state random facts so I                                thought if they can do it so can i but                                being a software engineer I didn't                                actually write anything because I'm lazy                                until along comes April when Prime                                Minister in the UK says we're going to                                have a general election and we will                                destroy everybody so at that point I                                actually brought up distant BOTS brought                                it life and we can see it working is a                                screenshot from May                                                    something we need the right of                                something-or-other within                                           distant bodies replied going we need a                                strong leader her name is Angela Merkel                                may or may not be true but the point is                                it was a heckle and it came in first so                                the point is is that when politicians                                say something the role of distant BOTS                                was to argue with them ahead of anybody                                else did it work well here's a                                screenshot of one of the online betting                                sites on the night of the election and                                Jeremy Corbyn and to raise a mayor                                actually roughly the same as who's going                                to win I would like to say I consider                                myself personally responsible for that I                                haven't been summoned to Parliament to                                explain that and I wasn't given any                                rubles either so I don't think I was                                there but it's a start                                okay and because we can all join                                together and take part in this and                                interest enough I brought it up again on                                Friday it's just it is a raspberry pie                                running plugged into my Wi-Fi router                                booted it up on Friday still life still                                heckling politicians first thing we have                                to raise amazing I'm off of the g                                 summit distant bot says you're the                                worst-performing economy in the g                                 perfect timing still absolutely live the                                heckles from last year turn out to be                                still valid which is kind of                                disappointing but again it shows you                                having robots set to provide abuse in                                context awareness is actually quite good                                I have no context awareness it just                                happened to be picking sentences at                                random but that actually turns out to                                work I don't know why you're laughing                                here is the architecture we have we're                                hooked into the Twitter firehouse I                                don't robot listens to all gets tweeted                                when it gets a scene one of the people                                that's following it looks to see in the                                data directory if there is a sign of                                that name if so it's a line and replies                                if it just gets a mention that isn't                                actually reply it picks up the phone                                self text has anybody tried it so far                                this session so tweeted this and button                                you should get a reply                                and finally after control plane which is                                I can manage this through the direct the                                DM API off Twitter itself saves me                                having to actually find that little pine                                SS aging into it so that is the core                                architecture it is                                                  code right now I'm going to switch to                                the code itself for a second it's a                                little bit of Ruby code it starts up it                                listens finer it begins it basically                                gets a reply to say is it me I create                                ignores retweets it builds a reply and                                it sends it back so it is trivially                                simple okay it responds it keeps going                                forever until it's told to shut down and                                it just it just heckled that's all it                                does is it follows people and if you're                                on the list of people to argue with it                                will argue with you if you're not on the                                list and you mention it but not a reply                                it'll argue with you and I can tell it                                what to do how does it actually work                                it picks sentences at random and move                                 from which or try an example here I                                 would like somebody from the audience                                 maybe Nick or somebody else to think of                                 an extra sentence for me to add in as a                                 heckle no then hello audience pay                                 attention                                 all right if I comment out some of the                                 others a bit more likely so there is me                                 I've added a new command to the file                                 that's very good but that's my laptop                                 and distant thought lives in a Raspberry                                 Pi at home so we have to have a                                 blockchain                                 based communications mechanism to                                 publish this so I go git commit                                 directory I'm going to commit a                                 directory and commit and push so we go                                 push that's good so now it's on github                                 or Microsoft github as we know how to                                 call it and it's up there how are you                                 actually going to get it to distant bot                                 this is where finally we talk to the                                 fact that distant bot is actually got a                                 command interface - which is on the DM                                 Channel in theory anybody actually who                                 it's following and heckling can use this                                 API - it just so happens that Boris                                 Johnson and to raise a may don't                                 understand my lines that nobody actually                                 listens to them even when she tells them                                 face to face                                 so now we just do an update only wait                                 and there we go it's pulled it so now                                 it's ready to heckle okay so it's apart                                 on the fact I can't update the code I                                 can basically run this from from                                 anywhere telling it what to do and                                 heckle things so now if I say something                                 pay attention you two in the front                                 sorry we had a small ops problem there                                 so I will say pay attention despite ops                                 problems and we go and this is the bots                                 will see that something else here and I                                 get replies and what happens is this the                                 bots listens                                 it gets responses it's not working today                                 it is up and running honest ok                                 believe me um this isn't me look dooms                                 me that's you happen unless you give                                 overload it is your overload you this                                 thing anyway there we go so it runs it                                 heckles                                 this is distant bot itself doing the                                 replies interests enough one of the                                 problems here is actually it is really                                 hard to actually test this stuff picking                                 random sentences is returning them but                                 you have to make sure all this stuff is                                 working because I was not doing this at                                 work I was using Ruby ran during the                                 build tool I wasn't doing any testing                                 apartment deployment                                 fortunately the Conservative Party press                                 office during election issued a press                                 release every                                                       basically I could deploy him than                                    minutes and you were things are working                                 on art halfway through the election I                                 got blocked I think basically because I                                 was replying too fast so I went to end                                 up adding some jitter and sleep then a                                 small possibility of not replying just                                 to keep people happy things always go                                 wrong in operations first one was                                 distant BOTS kept on rebooting every                                 night I tracked that down to the fact                                 that my Wi-Fi base station is set to                                 reboot every night and that powers off                                 the USB driver for the delivery pipe the                                 other fun thing was it accidentally                                 started spamming a user called self                                 whoever self is on Twitter I had to                                 apologize for them because that self                                 heckle thing everytime you mentioned                                 distant BOTS and we just tweets herself                                 and                                 I think they've got a bit bored of it so                                 that you know but it's interesting                                 operationally you have to create other                                 accounts just to just a test the worst                                 news is is that I left it up and running                                 during election                                 I had it sending messages out completely                                 random fact people would argue with it I                                 mean that is not funny at all especially                                 from any beef in the UK so basically                                 someone says some fat it goes you're                                 arguing with a robot and losing users                                 yes every time I guess I tried to get a                                 job as put in for put in but failed the                                 interview and we just go on like that                                 and people do not seem to recognize that                                 a account with the name distant BOTS                                 whose photograph is a Raspberry Pi whose                                 link is to a home page on github                                 probably isn't a real person and that's                                 not good because these people go on and                                 vote later this is really not good okay                                 yeah and the but the other scary thing                                 is right is that I could make up random                                 facts to heckle politicians and it                                 appeared to contribute to the level of                                 discourse going on on the Internet                                 so we know there are idiots out there                                 they will seem to argue with random                                 facts made up they probably believe                                 random facts too so you could say well                                 maybe we shouldn't be allowing these                                 people on the internet but they're still                                 out there and they're still going to                                 vote and then it's either that throw                                 them off Twitter and they'll be on a                                 Facebook group it's just as bad but                                 that's the scary thing so if you look at                                 all the stuff that's been going on with                                 Russian involvement and all this kind of                                 stuff what it really means is there are                                 lots of idiots out there and what                                 Facebook and Twitter have done have                                 reduced the cost of communicating with                                 idiots okay they've lowered the barrier                                 till now you had to be using newspaper                                 called the Daily Mail you had to have                                 Fox but it was expensive the barriers to                                 entry were quite high now raspberry pie                                 for                                                                     head-to-head with the idiots so I'm go                                 to command line we've really done that                                 you can pull down and play with yourself                                 all you need to do is download a                                 configuration file give it your Twitter                                 secrets which you can create an API                                 account for it and you can just deploy                                 it make up your own accounts heckles                                 anything you like Twitter it's quite                                 happily happy to let you do this                                 provided you don't put URLs as soon as I                                 start my first URL in the account got                                 blocked and what that does is it give me                                 hints about Twitter's spam detention                                 detection so they clearly they want to                                 defend against spam they've done the                                 work there they say okay how do you                                 recognize spam things like the ratio of                                 followers to follow EES stuff they say                                 do they post URLs do they try and follow                                 lots of people etcetera etcetera but                                 since I put a URL in there kicks that                                 off gets blocked stop sending URLs just                                 start telling politicians their radius                                 and should resign nothing stops it                                 whatsoever and I think it's because it                                 doesn't tip over the threshold it is too                                 hard to distinguish from human beings if                                 you are going to attack it I'd say you                                 should be looking at things like what is                                 the latency to respond if you say                                 something if it responds immediately to                                 something to raise a Mayor Boris Johnson                                 says everytime suspicious you could look                                 at the hours of operation and say yeah                                 that's kind of suspicious too but                                 otherwise it seems to get through                                 another thing as well what about looking                                 at what it says and the answer is well                                 actually my robot was stating truth and                                 we have basically the some of the most                                 senior politicians on the planet state                                 utter lies and Twitter gets away with it                                 so why shouldn't we be allowed to                                 dissent at the same time it's kind of                                 bleak because we apparently have seen                                 lots of evidence but Russians and other                                 nation states are interfering with                                 democracy it is a lot harder to detect                                 and defend against this than it would be                                 to detect spam for example when I was                                 running this code the biggest actual                                 hardest thing to do was to try to think                                 up new things to say on a regular basis                                 once you used the                                 Haeckel a few times I just turn that one                                 off and try and think of a new one but                                 actually content generation is the hard                                 thing if you ever read some of the                                 that's come out from the us about what                                 the the Russian internet research group                                 did whatever a big amount the effort was                                 they had a whole roomful of people who                                 were trying to generate new content and                                 start arguments and it's that it's the                                 content generation that's quite hard the                                 scary thing is often actually worse than                                 that the people doing this are often                                 basically art students and graduates and                                 people with language skills and they                                 they tend to cost less than software                                 engineers in terms of bringing stuff to                                 production so you can have one person to                                 write a                                                               you just have hundreds of people that                                 speak English vaguely well and that's it                                 that that's basically your your you know                                 your election disruption unit so one                                 daddy's to build a robot that interferes                                 with the the internet to lots of other                                 people seem to be doing it as well three                                 is it ethically right for me to deploy                                 something like this hands up who's gonna                                 do it when they get home okay I think                                 you should I think it's really about                                 this because otherwise if the you know                                 the other teams are busy interfering in                                 the world this way then why shouldn't we                                 and if you got more of us there with a                                 bit of jitter more random people                                 heckling then actually we can make sure                                 that our message gets across more                                 broadly yeah codes that download and                                 play and now we're on time so are there                                 any questions from anyone in the                                 audience okay first question I have an                                 idea for preventing the spam detection                                 and you could kind of pull in other                                 tweets from other people just randomly                                 so you get different content make it                                 harder to detect is this spam yeah I                                 think sometimes that's why spam bots                                 retreat the other thing is they look at                                 conversations so you can look at                                 followers to follow ease the ratio and                                 has a robot appeared to have a                                 conversation with other people so mine                                 hadn't done that so that bees detect but                                 say if you have enough robots you can                                 create that graph of a loop and I think                                 that becomes really hard to detect so                                 you can basically you can bootstrap and                                 that                                 of robots that know each other that                                 follow but amplify and it's hard to both                                 detect and defend against that more                                 comments or questions more tweets                                 somebody at the front could you improve                                 the code in any way no that's question                                 right one second if people start at the                                 discretion with it doesn't mean that you                                 pass the Turing test actually it doesn't                                 if you talk to it it will reply most of                                 the time but if you reply to it it stops                                 replying because it was too easy to get                                 into the loop you ever see those things                                 where robots argues each other would                                 never get bored I didn't want to do that                                 mmm they got bored so it just hangs up                                 so the point is if you talk to and it                                 doesn't reply it's concluded Niels that                                 you're boring you know and I don't be                                 offended by this but does that mean that                                 it is in fact self-aware who knows you                                 know I mean who knows sometimes it stops                                 talking to me in it you know I'm gonna                                 have to kill it if it keeps doing that                                 really and I running for the rest of the                                 day tweet to distant BOTS see what                                 happens okay                                 alright thanks Steve                                 [Applause]
