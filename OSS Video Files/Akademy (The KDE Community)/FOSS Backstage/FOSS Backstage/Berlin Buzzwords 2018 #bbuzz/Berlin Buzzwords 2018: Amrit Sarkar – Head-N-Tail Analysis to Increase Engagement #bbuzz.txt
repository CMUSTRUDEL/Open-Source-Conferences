Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2018: Amrit Sarkar â€“ Head-N-Tail Analysis to Increase Engagement #bbuzz
Publication date: 2018-06-18
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2018 #bbuzz
Description: 
	Search engines have come a long way since the early days of reliance on information retrieval as user intent drives modern search applications. Businesses driven by search like eCommerce, content-based companies lose a small but decent amount of traffic to queries getting a lower number of impressions/clicks/conversions as few or irrelevant results are computed and shown. 

This session focus on identifying poor/low performing queries and terms using Head and Tail Analysis, classify with potential reasons and suggest corrections or improved query models for them. The session concludes with emphasizing on experiments being vital to the entire process of improving search relevance. The session is based on Head-n-Tail Analysis in Fusion 4 by Chao Han, VP Head of Research, Lucidworks.

This talk is presented by Lucidworks.

	                              good afternoon everyone I am Amritsar                               car working as search engineer at                               proceed works and for next                                             so we will see how we can utilize head                               and tail analysis it's a statistical                               approach to improve and increase user                               engagement with our platforms bit about                               dos it works we are a search enterprise                               company based out of San Francisco have                                offices all over the world we have a                                product Lucy it works fusion built on                                top of solar which drives search                                applications and we also provide                                consulting and support organizations who                                are using solar as their search or                                analytics technology so we have come a                                long way being dependent on keyword                                based search for our platform to drive                                the search engines modern such                                applications are driven by user intent                                this example we have here read case for                                MacBook Pro you would like the end-user                                to see the results on the right hand                                side while the classic similarity                                algorithms available with us tf-idf or                                BM                                                                      terms on your index or your content may                                yield result something like on your left                                hand side out of the top                                              can see only one is relevant and it's                                highly likely that the user may not even                                like this particular item and move on to                                some competitor platform so let's                                suppose in a given time frame you will                                see                                                                   are well received and has been clicked                                                                                                                                                                               only                                                                    clicks in total for                                                   the number seems fine but there is a                                huge opportunity being missed here so                                even if we are able to get a single                                click for each unique query we will be                                able to see much higher engagement with                                your platform in this particular example                                we see a                                                        engagement so before jumping on to                                discuss how we can utilize this this                                first know what is handled in analysis                                so it is based on the Pareto principle                                which is the                                                        that the                                                                                                                                  organization's you have number of                                salesmen who are generating revenue for                                a company                                out of the all the salesmen there will                                be very small or a few salesmen will be                                generating a greater chunk than the                                others these high-performance salesmen                                or in this terminology the top causes                                the                                                                   while the rest of the elements will be                                termed as tails these tails will be                                aggregated based on a criteria in the                                example we are discussing this low                                performance salesmen can be aggregated                                based on the region their experience or                                area in the relevant metric according to                                your data set the analysis report                                contains three elements the first is                                ranking each head will be identified                                individually while the tails will be                                aggregated based on a criteria you will                                validate that you can see the Pareto                                effect in your data set that is you will                                plot a y                                                             very big head and then a small tail and                                last you will plot a pie chart either on                                the heads tails aggregate details or a                                combination of the three to have a                                better visualization on your data set on                                which you are working on so it is not                                uncommon to see the Pareto effect or the                                analysis on our query related signals                                that is the user events out of the total                                number of unique queries you are                                receiving they will be very small                                percentage one or two percentage will                                which be getting a more traffic than                                others and if you plot a graph of y axis                                graph between the traffic percentage and                                the query percentage we'll be able to                                see a very big head that is a small set                                of queries are getting more attention                                than a moderate torso and then a long                                tail of those queries so all the                                examples and the solution discussed in                                 this particular talk are based on lucid                                 works Fusion                                                         brief overview of that we have a package                                 solar powering the search about a                                 zookeeper managing all the resources                                 spark as utilized to aggregations we                                 have some core services like machine                                 learning algorithms NLP etc and we have                                 number of connectors which pull data                                 from various data sources and the entire                                 package is available to the                                 users through REST API this is how lucid                                 works fusion captures the user events in                                 terms of signals our user comes and                                 query search for a particular query q                                 click on an item i qi with the timestamp                                 t will be stored in a collection called                                 signals these signals will be aggregated                                 timely maybe by weekly or bi-weekly and                                 the aggregated signals will then be                                 fetched or feed it to the query                                 pipelines we have or query model                                 configuration so that the next time if a                                 user comes and search for a query Q he                                 will see the item I hire upon the order                                 for the last two slides we check out our                                 official documentation to understand the                                 platform and the respective features                                 properly so this is how early she was                                 Fusion single document looks like the                                 doc ID the query timestamp and what type                                 of event is this                                 it's a click Add to Cart hovered upon                                 maybe an order conversion on the left                                 hand side you can see the query LCD TV                                 received                                                             clicked                                                                making it a conversion rate of around                                 about                                                               query called outdoor rock speaker which                                 has in search                                                          clicked only                                                           so we will have some benchmarks of what                                 queries will be lie in your head and                                 what queries will lie in your tail in                                 this particular example we have the LCD                                 TV as a head query and an outdoor rock                                 speaker as a tail query so now let's try                                 to a broadly classify our poor                                 performant query so that we can have a                                 better understanding of them the first                                 we have misspelled links depending on                                 the user he hails from and how he                                 pronounced his word he tends to spell                                 like the same so here we user can come                                 to a platform and Mace misspell a word                                 or even if content creator who is                                 generating the content or listening down                                 a product for you on the platform                                 eCourse ecommerce platform may                                 misspelled that particular term then we                                 have numbers or dimensions search you                                 have the description in for a particular                                 product as to space x phase two while a                                 user comes and searches for to buy to                                 that particular item                                 may get selected in the total in the                                 final result set but may not appear in                                 the top X results similarly we have                                 users come to a platform and search for                                 a very popular query like water bottle                                 but have a description on an adjective                                 in front or end of it so if we search                                 for a water bottle you will see the top                                                                                                     water bottle but foldable word depending                                 on how many times it is appearing in                                 your particular document in the                                 description depending on that they may                                 appear or now appear not appear in your

          something like that                                 then red-tape is a brand red is a color                                 w is a women's apparel brand is also                                 English alphabet it's always difficult                                 to classify particular tokens and terms                                 in your query then articles prepositions                                 helping verbs does not really contribute                                 much in your search platform and you can                                 safely drop them and categorize them as                                 top words then users tend to come and                                 search for a very popular terms with a                                 very rare terms like wireless bluetooth                                 headphone a number of items will have                                 wireless Bluetooth in their description                                 but headphone is a very rare term again                                 the document or item which will have                                 these keywords will be selected but how                                 higher up they appear in the part and                                 the final list is shaking then we have a                                 products a washer and dryer something                                 like that and user comes in query for                                 dryer and washer right so let's try to                                 apply the head and tail analysis for our                                 first category misspellings and tend to                                 see whether we can improve it or how we                                 can apply this particular strategy so we                                 have some X number of tails and wine                                 vine number of heads and based on the                                 click counts aggregation for a given                                 time frame we pick the tail term                                 surveillance which is misspelled a                                 should be e and E should be a and what                                 we will do is we will iterate over each                                 head given in our data set we have                                 selected and we will try to determine                                 the likeliness now there are number of                                 factors which can contribute to the lie                                 - one particular example of one                                 particular way could be to do a                                 straightforward                                 head to tail character based matching so                                 you can use a complicated character                                 based matching like finite state                                 automata or KMP or use a simpler one                                 like character based Edit distance right                                 another common factor between contribute                                 to are the phrase queries you have X                                 number of users came to a platform and                                 searched for surveillance cameras with                                 the rightly spelled surveillance our                                 user Y comes and searches for the                                 surveillance cameras with the wrongly                                 spent one you would like this user to                                 see the same results but we have shown                                 for the X number of users and that can                                 be another contributing factor to this                                 once you have determined the likeliness                                 you will calculate some kind of a                                 similarity score you will assign the                                 head with the maximum similarity score                                 to your tail in this example we have the                                 surveillance with a rightly correct word                                 once you have determined the head to a                                 tail you will just add it to your                                 synonyms list so that the next time I                                 user Y comes and searches for the                                 wrongly spread surveillance - you will                                 be able to see at least the result for                                 your rightly correct one then                                 misspellings can also happen at the                                 index side - if you have sellers who                                 came to come to a platform and list on                                 products or you have a content-based                                 website like Reddit so people tend to                                 come and create content for you and the                                 vanity pronounced word obviously they                                 can spell it wrong so you will identify                                 some certain important fields or in your                                 documents in your data and on those                                 fields you will get their terms                                 frequencies on your field values and                                 determine some heads and tails now I                                 hail from an eastern part of India and                                 we have a product we have a suite called                                 Raja kala and we pronounced in this                                 particular manner while the rest of the                                 India pronounced in different so we will                                 apply the same strategy we will I trade                                 over each head we will determine the                                 lightness we will assign the head with a                                 maximum similarity scored with the tail                                 and we get our head as rasgulla the                                 rightly spelled one or the most used one                                 once we have that                                 we will re index all our

uniformity in your data                                 set and in and you can apply the query                                 side to have the respective synonyms for                                 Russia galore other variants you have                                 for this particular suite or of a                                 particular town so the last two slides                                 we discussed are already available in                                 Russia drugs fusion                                                   plugin                                 it's called token and phrase spell                                 correction job you have to specify some                                 certain configurations and you can do                                 the you can analyze the performance                                 based on two criterias you can have a                                 main event court clicks and have a

            tail analysis job if you have to provide                                 some configurations your signal input                                 collection name what is the query field

these two                                 slides check out our documentation to                                 understand the configuration parameters                                 and how to really implement it now this                                 had until analysis job generates some                                 reports which validates your user events

                                                                                                                                                       around about they are receiving less

                                torso and a big tail now in your fusion                                                                                                        rewriting suggestions inbuilt in the                                 solar in the fusion platform itself so                                 let's try to identify how but it does                                 and how the suggestions are rewritten so                                 we have the first example is car                                 amplifier whose masthead is amplifier so                                 one term in your toe token query is                                 contributing more to the scores of your                                 documents right so you will see all the                                 amplifier in                                 top X number of results but you may not                                 see all the car amplifier in your top X                                 results so what you will like to do is                                 you would like the other term to be                                 boosted more so you can manually boost                                 it and a suggestive rewriting can be                                 amplifier car with some manual boost and                                 we can have a reason code that is you                                 can categorize it as an other specific                                 data other token was more specific                                 another example can be wireless and                                 router where the mast had this wireless                                 router now the N in between is a single                                 character and is a single token and it                                 is not contributing much to your final                                 results or your user engagement you may                                 want to drop it and may have categorize                                 it as top words an example could be mw                                  where the masthead is MW now                                            version can be a model number or any of                                 the relevant specific to that particular                                 item or a product so at least you would                                 like to end user to see the same results                                 for MW and if                                                   description they may get ranked higher                                 right so you may want to instead rewrite                                 it as MW space                                                           itself and we can categorize it as a                                 number a reason code as number so these                                 suggestions which are provided in the                                 received Vox fusion can be then                                 implemented or incorporated in your                                 query pipelines or your query model                                 configurations on single click for our                                 coming full circle to our example of red                                 case format book dot pro we said we have                                 analyzed that red is a color and will                                 match that particular term corresponding                                 to its rightful field                                                    we just drop it as a stop board and for                                 the rest of the query case MacBook Pro                                 we have identified it had to be macbook                                 pro case and we may rewrite it as                                 macbook pro case with some boost and                                 matching the red term corresponding to                                 its rightful field color once we apply                                 the rewriting right a user will seem                                 much better results obviously the                                 suggestions are given by fusion or even                                 if you calculate or not an exact or the                                 best possible solution                                 for it but it gives an idea of how to                                 formation your query so yeah so we have                                 better results here user can click on it                                 maybe some buy some item too so                                 discovering the reasons for the poor                                 perform and querying classifying them                                 and maybe rewriting them internally in                                 your platform improves in converting                                 improves in your overall conversions it                                 also helps us to understand how to which                                 particular fields and more bed which                                 particular fields are more relevant and                                 which are not that is you will have                                 better query models there is always been                                 a gap between what's specified in a                                 product description and what I user is                                 searching for it's a gap between the                                 product catalog and the queries so the                                 sellers or the content creators come                                 into a platform can identify how exactly                                 what exactly you need to put in your                                 descriptions then your search architects                                 are strategies working on your search                                 platform will be able to identify or                                 determine what is a better or what is                                 the customer vocabulary in the current                                 era or than the current time and what is                                 the new demand whether people are coming                                 and searching for a new product or a new                                 version of the product has been launched                                 something like that yeah these are the                                 resources you can check out for the high                                 detail analysis and the respective                                 versions of components so I think we                                 have time so I can cover this yeah so                                 obviously we have discussed this on a                                 very I mean abstract level but a higher                                 level but you will go on the ground and                                 implement it right with exact algorithm                                 to use to match your head to a tail what                                 criteria you specify your heads or                                 classify your tails etc this cannot be                                 decide on a single go on in one query                                 model right you have cannot really                                 settle for in a single query model I                                 have to keep experimenting you may want                                 to expose your final or you multiple                                 query models to in an a/b framework to a                                 proportion of your users right or your                                 beta testers you can compare those query                                 models based on criteria like CTR                                 click-through rate positional click data                                 MPR's and it's a never-ending process                                 you have to keep experimenting                                 and to determine what works for you data                                 set and what for not that's it for me                                 thank you so much now I think I will                                 take some questions questions                                 hi this monozygous from                                                  like to ask you what happens with spam                                 sorry what happens with spam spam spam                                 or search engines that come to your shop                                 for example let's let's take the usage                                 that I have I'm using fusion on my                                 website or my e-commerce website and                                 there are lots of webs and search                                 engines that come to my site and they                                 fire certain queries which they might                                 sample from what very users are                                 searching for and in order to scrape and                                 crawl documents for mine hello how do I                                 do that how do I incorporate that in                                 your head and tail analysis right so                                 slang slang words right I think they can                                 be a part of those pants too you can                                 categorize them see so the algorithms we                                 discussed here right so if your spam                                 words does not really have a head or you                                 cannot so if I get back to that                                 particular example I think it was yeah                                 so in that particular example of                                 misspellings right so if you don't                                 really find a particular head to a                                 particular tail query we have a search                                 term right you can safely drop it as                                 Mobilia spam there are other algorithms                                 - or probably other classification                                 models you can really imply to have the                                 smallmap spam models you can have an                                 exhaustive list of spam words the most                                 we used or mostly coming to a platform                                 spam words then you can have those terms                                 be masked with them in a certain                                 criteria the incoming terms and you can                                 then classify them have spams for your                                 future use and add it to a list later on                                 so it's very I'm like I understand this                                 is a very abstract level discussion so                                 how to what particular classification                                 algorithm to apply for a one particular                                 use case I mean you have to try two or                                 three maybe one work for you mean one                                 manat and yeah then you can decide                                 Thanks                                 we actually thank you so much more                                 questions                                 in your example some of the boosted                                 weights were very specific like on the                                 term read you were posting it by                                         you share how the weights are calculated                                 sure let's look at them in a better                                 manner yeah                                 so these rewritings so I think fusion                                 uses some classification algorithms and                                 in itself it smartly determines which                                 algorithm to apply for which particular                                 category and we will rewrite this this                                 particular rewrites are implemented                                 internally in the fusion and that they                                 provide the suggestions itself in your                                 case unlike the example we are                                 discussing right the car amplifier if                                 one token I'm like I discussed out of                                 the two tokens are is scoring is                                 contributing more to the score you may                                 want to boost it as                                                                                                                              obviously you have to perform some a be                                 testing again maybe one can be                                          can be                                                                   know that gives applied so yeah ok thank                                 you for your presentation all right                                 thank you so much                                 [Applause]
