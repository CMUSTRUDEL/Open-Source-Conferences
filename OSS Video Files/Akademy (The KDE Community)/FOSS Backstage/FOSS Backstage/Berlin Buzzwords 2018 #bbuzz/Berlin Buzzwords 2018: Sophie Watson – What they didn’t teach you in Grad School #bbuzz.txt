Description: 
	Sophie Watson talking about "From Research to Production: What they didn’t teach you in Grad School".

Academic researchers find novel solutions to thorny problems in idealized environments. A research background is excellent preparation for advancing the state of the art, but newly-minted professional data scientists can find themselves in industry with an arsenal of problem-solving techniques that are not as potent as they seemed in graduate school:  data sets are larger and messier, solutions are judged by their outcomes rather than by their novelty, and products, unlike publications, require ongoing maintenance and support.

This talk will draw on the speaker’s experience bringing a mathematics research background to a team in industry. We will show both the challenges that data scientists face when entering industry from academia and the unique skills that they bring from their research background. We shall frame the discussion with a running example of cutting-edge statistical research embodied in an imperfect implementation. We’ll demonstrate iterative refinements to our implementation, showing how to take a research prototype to production code, with particular attention to real-world pitfalls that might not appear in a researcher’s daily work. Finally, we’ll show how trained researchers can turn their background into a superpower for applied teams in industry.

Early-career attendees who are considering joining industry from academia will learn how to navigate the challenges they’ll face on a mixed team and how to best use their gifts and skills in a new environment. Established practitioners will learn how to support, engage, and nurture their colleagues who are transitioning from academia. Everyone will learn how to adapt implementations and ideas from the research world for production applications.

	                              all right hi I'm Sophie I work at Red                               Hat as a software engineer and I'm part                               of a team whose focus is on designing                               intelligent applications to running                               containers on the cloud                               now when I say intelligent applications                               what I mean is applications which use                               machine learning or artificial                               intelligence nearly nine months ago I                                lived a very different life as a PhD                                student I spent four years at the                                University of Bristol getting a PhD from                                the Department of Mathematics there is a                                screenshot of the front cover of my                                thesis as proof my PhD was based in the                                statistics group and it focused on                                making inference for complex models                                represented here by this grey box maybe                                it's not so great anymore um so we were                                working in the Big Data regime in the                                sense that these models took in high                                dimensional parameters and spat out high                                dimensional data most of the models we                                working with were of complex ecological                                systems and I spent a lot of time                                working with the model of everybody's                                favorite animal the earthworm so on the                                surface my work here in industry is the                                same as it used to be I'm still doing                                statistics and programming I still have                                weekly meetings with a mentor and I                                still power my days with coffee but what                                I want to talk to you about in the next                                                                                                   lives in the grey section of that Venn                                diagram now a sensible question to ask                                yourself at this point is why should you                                care well who here is a grad student or                                has recently graduated so this could be                                you and that's so long and even if you                                do decide to stay in academia you'll                                probably have to lay eyes with industry                                at some point so it's important to                                understand where they're coming from                                everyone else well it doesn't take a                                statistician to tell you that it's                                highly likely that you will at some                                point in your career work with someone                                who is or was a grad student so                                hopefully you can gain insight into                                where they're coming from and how you                                can support them as they turn up on day                                one at your office's door so to                                structure my talk we'll look at three                                objectives so both academia and industry                                we'll begin by talking about the goals                                of the work what are the notable aims                                and achievements will then look at what                                drives the work or what's the incent                                and finally we'll look at some barriers                                to progress in both academia and in                                industry so let's dive in and think                                about goals now important and think                                about in order to think about goals it                                helps us to have a specific task in mind                                and the task I want you to think about                                is building a recommendation engine from                                what film we should watch tonight after                                we've gone out for dinner to who we                                should follow on social media many of                                today's most engaging and commercially                                important applications are providing                                personalized experiences to users and                                they're able to make personalized                                recommendations quickly and efficiently                                and in fact I've spent some some of my                                time here at Red Hat working on building                                a recommendation engine but what we're                                going to think about the task as now is                                recommendation engines from the point of                                academia now in academia the goal is                                publications and in order to get a                                publication you've got to do something                                that no one else has done before one of                                the leading algorithms for                                recommendation engines is alternating                                these squares and if I do a google                                scholar search for papers on alternating                                least squares and just look at the                                papers this year already there's already                                over                                                                 new isn't an easy feat but if I was                                going to I'd probably set off by                                following this little flow chart here                                and at some point I'd stop and I'd say                                okay I've done better than what came                                before how would I know that I'd done                                better well I'd probably run my                                algorithm on a static data set but                                 someone else had run their algorithm on                                 in their paper and I'd show that I've                                 got some reduction of error great I've                                 got myself a publication so let's take                                 such a paper such an algorithm and put                                 it into production now the algorithm                                 we're going to use improves on previous                                 algorithms by accounting for temporal                                 effects and it's legitimate it's real                                 it's cited by                                                         this data probably more by now                                 in order to implement it we're going to                                 need some data so the data we're going                                 to use is the movie lens project data so                                 this was collected by the group lens                                 research group at the University                                 Minnesota and the key point is that                                 there's                                                               we've got ourselves a lot of data as the                                 name suggests this is ratings that users                                 have made about films so let's pretend                                 that I'm the customer and we're building                                 this recommendation to give me a                                 suggestion for what film I should watch                                 now I've actually rated over a hundred                                 films I'm just showing you a snippet                                 here so you can see what I like in                                 general I like kids films and I dislike                                 scary movies so in this next cell I'm                                 appending the ratings that I made to the                                                                                                       dataset and then in the final cell I go                                 ahead and I build a model now you'll                                 have to take my word for it that those                                 three parameters rank iterations and                                 lambda have been selected optimally so                                 let's talk more about that last line                                 where we build a model this ALS train                                 function implements the algorithm in                                 that paper that I showed you earlier but                                 this isn't cold I wrote I'm using an                                 off-the-shelf implementation and this to                                 me was the first huge difference between                                 research and production the idea of                                 using some code that someone else has                                 written was not something I've done or                                 been encouraged to do throughout my PhD                                 and yet brings so many advantages so                                 this code is tried and tested and it                                 does what it says it will because loads                                 of other people have used it first when                                 I went to write up my thesis I had to                                 rerun some code that I had written in my                                 second year and you know I submit this                                 to conferences and put in papers and all                                 of a sudden I figure out that this code                                 isn't doing what I thought it was and                                 you know it's called I'd written but                                 that's not gonna happen here this code                                 is robust so I'm coding in Python here                                 and this code lives in the PI Spock ml                                 Lib recommendation and package so that's                                 Apache spark and Python sparks designed                                 for scale out over a large cluster and                                 in fact it sort of does all of the work                                 for you so within reason you don't have                                 to worry about the scaling what happens                                 on a basic level is that the driver                                 program sends off the words these                                 individual workers known as spark                                 executors and it runs the task                                 and then it returns output to the driver                                 node so this allows data to be analyzed                                 in parallel and it doesn't take any                                 overhead for me I don't really need to                                 know what's going on and that also came                                 as a huge shock I've done some parallel                                 computing during my PhD and in general                                 I'd call did something up in a day or so                                 and then I'd spend about six months                                 debugging it so Apache spark really                                 gives us this scaling power and it                                 wasn't something that I'd even heard of                                 until I turned up in industry and the                                 recommendation engine called now runs                                 quickly even on that twenty six million                                 ratings dataset so I always thought I                                 was working with big data when I was                                 doing my PhD but in practice I always                                 knew how much data there was and it                                 could all be processed on one computer                                 even if it meant that I just had to                                 leave it running for the weekend of go                                 and have a few extra coffees so I'd                                 never really appreciated the truly big                                 data is big so let's head back to the                                 recommendation engine and get some                                 ratings so in this first line I asked                                 the model that we built using that tried                                 and tested algorithm to give predictions                                 for all the films I have not seen and in                                 the second line I asked for the top ten                                 recommendations for me to be returned                                 now unless arrows plus Massacre is some                                 Disney film I just haven't heard of                                 these recommendations don't look so good                                 so this isn't gonna fly in production                                 but that algorithm is published that has                                 lots of citations and their positive                                 citations it's not people saying this                                 doesn't work and I trained it add                                 optimal parameter values so what's gone                                 wrong well the third number in every                                 triplet here is how many people rated                                 those films so you can see for the top                                 rated film for myself only one of the                                 person one person in that whole                                    million rated it now their opinions on                                 the films that I rated must have                                 coincided with my opinions but they also                                 rated this film highly and so it's                                 suggested to me and those are well cited                                 published algorithm is failing we don't                                 want this in production so that brings                                 us nicely on to industry goals the goal                                 here is to build a recommendation engine                                 that works where                                 works means improves the overall                                 performance of our application by                                 helping us meet some business objectives                                 there's gonna be some metric that were                                 optimizing for but it's not mean squared                                 error of the parameters of the model for                                 example so what we're missing right now                                 is the sensible recommendations and it                                 turns out all we have to do to get these                                 is filter out films that have a low                                 number of folds so I filtered out from                                 seven rated by fewer than                                                all of the sudden these recommendations                                 look much better now that filtering                                 process isn't amending alternatingly                                 squares it's not novel tons of people                                 have done it before me and it's not                                 gonna get me a publication or burn me a                                 research price but it works                                 I could ship this okay so let's stop                                 briefly about personal incentives when I                                 started my PhD my main motivation was to                                 be a world-class research I wanted my                                 name and lights I wanted citations                                 coming out of my ears I wanted it all                                 that quickly fizzled away in the next                                 year or so I wanted to be a reasonable                                 PhD student and sadly all the time that                                 could be fizzled away in getting a job                                 getting a PhD so that I could go and get                                 a job so my personal incentives were                                 driven by my supervisors incentives but                                 in general what I do doesn't affect him                                 he's already got more PhD students                                 filling the place that I left behind um                                 so it's generally just me striving to                                 get that PhD now when I first rolled up                                 an industry after grad school the main                                 incentive was being paid money that                                 quickly changed um I wanted to work that                                 my company and my team are proud of why                                 well for one that makes me feel good and                                 arguably that's the same in research but                                 here there's a much bigger picture by                                 helping my team achieve goals                                 I feel valued and I feel spoiled I                                 wanted to do better so working as part                                 of a team was by no means unexpected to                                 me but it was much more of an adjustment                                 than I imagined I found it very                                 difficult to know whether I'm asking for                                 too much help                                 enough help whether I should work on my                                 own whether I should collaborate and                                 communicating what I do is now a vital                                 importance when I was a grad student                                 everyone had some vague idea of what I                                 did but no one really knows the details                                 all of a sudden not only does my team                                 need to know what I'm doing but they                                 actually care I think okay so in the                                 last couple of minutes let's talk about                                 some boundaries to progress in both                                 settings I think this fellows are nicely                                 from Lara's talk earlier if he's still                                 around he talked about some common                                 pitfalls that we might fall into so I                                 feel like constraints the main                                 constraint in both settings is time so                                 long gone are the days of spending ten                                 years doing your PhD in the UK if you do                                 not hand in your PhD thesis within four                                 years you automatically fail but Finnish                                 doesn't really mean finished the last                                 chapter of my thesis was entitled                                 further work and there's already a PhD                                 students at my desk                                 picking up where I left off so it's fine                                 furthermore if I decided that I wanted                                 to spend a month thinking about                                 something completely pointless but                                 vaguely mathematical everyone was happy                                 with that                                 it didn't add to my thesis but that was                                 cool with that in mind I think your                                 incentives and your goals have to be                                 stronger in academia in order to drive                                 you forward in production the notion of                                 deadlines are more frequent and much                                 more concrete particularly if we're                                 working towards a release date or a                                 customer's timeline but I'm never the                                 last person to work on a project and                                 with that in mind I've got to think more                                 about how I spend my time so could I use                                 my statistics background to get an                                 incremental improvement in that                                 recommendation engine if I spent the                                 next                                                                    on it yeah definitely but is that worth                                 while given that we've got something                                 that works probably not so I have to                                 think more about when to stop in                                 production how done is done now we                                 touched on the size of data sets then we                                 talked about scaling out using Apache                                 spark but something I hadn't appreciated                                 is how difficult it is to                                 we get decent data for training and                                 development so in research the day or                                 had always been handed to me it was data                                 that someone else had used in their                                 paper I wanted to run my algorithm on                                 that exact same dataset to show that I                                 did better or compare my results but in                                 production I want to make things that                                 are new and real so I need real data and                                 it's just not there for the taking the                                 only time the first time I was handed a                                 dataset in my new job it had not been                                 cleaned and I had not appreciated that                                 data cleansing was even a thing but I                                 thought this dataset was huge and it was                                 a CSV and I thought well I've got pH D                                 it's separated by commas how hard can it                                 be so on that note if you're a grad                                 student I hope that you're prepared to                                 stand on the shoulders of giants use                                 code that already exists and don't try                                 to reinvent the wheel and keep your                                 goals in mind because they're going to                                 drive you if you're in industry please                                 be open to being asked for help and                                 don't see it as a sign of weakness you a                                 lot of people potentially think that                                 grad students know we're all but                                 actually we know very little um you know                                 something very detailed about a very                                 minor thing but we do have many great                                 skills                                 so please exploit those and turn us into                                 great co-workers so you can find me on                                 Twitter that's my email address and this                                 URL down here is where we keep all of                                 the information about the recommendation                                 engine the my team built                                 thank you very much Sophie                                 [Applause]
