Description: 
	Learning to rank (LTR) has been considered the next generation tool to improve relevance of product search solutions. Inspired by its popularity (Buzzwords 2017) and by the challenges we have at GetYourGuide, a global marketplace for tours and activities, we started a project to introduce LTR in our search engine. I

n this talk, we would like to share our Logbook from day 1 to the current project status. It covers challenges, lessons learned, good practices and pain points you need to know when navigating on LTR tides, such as:
- Pick the right tools to collect data, train and run machine learning models on your search engine
- Distribute and scale training and test into Spark to move faster
- Know your domain (what is relevance for the business) and the diversity of real user queries
- Challenge the quality of your training set and how you collect judgments after each iteration
- Design A/B experiments and define metrics to evaluate the quality of your models

Improving ranking is always an ongoing project. Each of previous topics brought, and they are still bringing, us many good learnings. I would like to share them on this talk and bring good practical contributions to new adopters of LTR for ranking on product (enterprise) search.

          we have those activities more than                                      destinations we are more than                                    employees kind of then your data team                                and we are based here in Berlin in                                Zurich as a marketplace in your other                                market place search is very important                                for us and you have many search features                                in our website we have first a pretty                                standard one a full-text search we have                                in your in your mobile app but also in                                your desktop version and your very                                location driven because you ask for the                                customers where were they going and this                                page has many purpose they may want                                maybe discovery from this page a                                customer can find places to travel and                                as similar to many marketplace are                                ranking here is a composition of                                business metrics and tax similarity                                metrics well I also have something                                interesting called location page looks                                like a landing page but there is no                                static content they'll search it going                                on here and this page is also very                                location driven because those tourist                                stores activities here are about Paris                                they all belong to Paris and these are                                even more important here because the                                actives are popular so they run out of                                variability quickly and we use those                                pages in your ads so it means that we                                paid for the                                this trafficking and also received high                                intent customers we know that all the                                customers who lent this page through an                                app ad are interesting to travel to                                Paris and then today we use the door                                rang key here and I don't have matching                                problems its composite mainly mostly by                                business metrics spa page is very                                important for the moment you are the                                business and then you have some problems                                with this strategy the focus of business                                metric is good in terms of you are sure                                if things that sell well and people want                                to buy but we is very difficult                                introducing new products and new                                projects let's say if you are using                                conversion rate a new problem does a new                                product doesn't have conversions                                impressions and also diversity here is a                                problem and we are missing opportunity                                as I mentioned we use these pages in                                your ads so we beat for some search                                keywords on those ads and do use them so                                if you bid for this keyword Eiffel Tower                                ticket and Eiffel Tower restaurant today                                we show the for both case the same                                content so I'm missing opportunity so                                definitely need should you need to learn                                how to rank the activities in this page                                and that's what I talked about today for                                those doesn't know lunch rank only a                                very brief introduction here if you                                consider this a search engine you have                                documents here and a pretty standard                                search system receives up gray and they                                don't have to fetch the document and                                then it will somehow apply some formula                                here to sort order those documents when                                we talk about learning we have we have a                                company to learn system that's know from                                your past data how to rank a cup of a                                set of documents for a particular Kray                                so when your query kimsen we know how to                                what model we want to use and then you                                use this model to rank by your during                                the results so that's the agenda are my                                log book I go through the scope and                                 decisions that you have to made in this                                 project at get your guide some tools and                                 data pipelines were built the lessons                                 that you learn in a stew learning what's                                 not covering a I won't be covering half                                 that is called modeling evaluation of                                 the models we are using the this would                                 be an overview for                                 kiss me who works in the produce since                                 the beginning and to the current states                                 of the prove it so okay I would like to                                 start talking about the first iteration                                 so we had to make some decisions our                                 problem is very complex so it made some                                 decisions                                 and the final scope let's recap before                                 while you're doing that to get your                                 guide we want to apply machine learn and                                 your you're on ranking formula on                                 location pays to introduce you traduce                                 text relevance factors so we current                                 will have there many business factors we                                 want to keep then maybe add more but                                 also introduce introduce relevance                                 factors on this formula and with this we                                 will be using our real user intention                                 data and bring some dynamic ranking                                 landing page to achieve this with the                                 final a focus and the focus on this                                 intelligent aeration was points off                                 interested we have many location pages                                 and then we have the scores of pure ice                                 points of interested it's nothing more                                 specific than a low Denis Eady or now                                 area is something like Eiffel Tower                                 Louvre Museum here in Berlin is the TV                                 tower so it decided to focus on this                                 vertical we also have                                                 your website but sites you focus on                                 English to reduce the complexity of the                                 problem one important thing here is that                                 on location pages and make sure you                                 don't have the explicit user cry there                                 is no search box there on the dot on the                                 user can type and search but they have                                 the keywords and are going to try to                                 apply them to make use those keywords                                 and then I example of keywords that will                                 be disliked this Eiffel Tower at least a                                 TOEFL IBT both true that is this is a                                 rich keyword we have location here and                                 also some intention for the customer and                                 then for this view one we try we try to                                 be very envy P so we follow the                                 basically standard steps of ultra                                 solution follow what everyone's doing I                                 will cover these steps during the                                 presentation but basically we need to                                 quality judgments is tracked features                                 then have our training set                                            validate our models run AP tests analyze                                 the results                                 and if I'll define the next iteration                                 okay so we start the project they want                                 we need to collect our judge Melissa I                                 judge my list is also golden Seto is the                                 base for your model to learn                                 so from this judge my list we can                                 feature on top of that and have our                                 training set so we decide to get the                                 highest traffic search keywords or with                                 this we have some subset of queries that                                 were relevant for our business we have                                 demand for those queries and then we had                                 a list like this for we have a search                                 keyword and and we decide to have for                                 that keyword for that location page                                 index is my fault our and the keywords                                 Eiffel Tower summit axis want to measure                                 once you get some signal here how                                 relevant out what is the relevance the                                 judgment for this document so in second                                 example we have                                                       for a fourth hour might not be relevant                                 would have to collect this somehow and                                 they also have simple search keywords                                 keywords without location part for                                 example we had in the contest of Eiffel                                 Tower this is all job guide so for those                                 who are familiar with how to structure                                 the deeper the training set this is our                                 query the combination of uses to factor                                 this keyword can be used in many other                                 location but this keyword for that                                 location page was how relevant is this                                 top MIT and how did you populate the                                 journalist for a view one we decide we                                 get a is way and decide to collect                                 judgments from humans or use a human                                 label of labeling approach the judgments                                 are collected on my experts and experts                                 in this case was internal stakeholders                                 of get your guide and we ask them to                                 judge from a schedule                                                   something that is not relevant at all                                 and trees and something that's very                                 relevant in this round we collect about                                                                                                     judgment okay we think like you thought                                 let's analyze the how booties are                                 ranking so let's evaluate base                                 the the how would the rank your crew                                 drink and then you apply we label                                 everything then you apply in CG at seven                                 and you got fifty five percent so so one                                 more education very bad score but that                                 we need to move forward this one more                                 facial play out here what's good and bad                                 and you apply human label isn't my list                                 well when our data is good when your                                 debt is incomplete or inconsistent not                                 in the server case but this might be a                                 good approach so like ask for experts                                 you label your later what is relevant                                 its you unclear what I mean here let's                                 say that you have a commerce and then                                 you want to measure from data if the                                 document is relevant for a specific way                                 you can consider clicks but as as as                                 well you know it's ambiguous not not                                 necessarily boots would a good way to                                 measure my cue if the user book later                                 that rule might be a good a good                                 approach forget the relevance so what is                                 not clear yet what is the path to                                 achieved what is relevant for you expert                                 can help you to have to at least be one                                 and one interesting thing is that when                                 you get from data you need to prepare                                 data your Crowley data like you need to                                 apply steamers normalize cluster the                                 data that are similar to see how they                                 behavior but when you are talking with                                 experts they know that they are domain                                 expert so they know the the stop words                                 is not synonymous so you need to                                 normalize this thing to collect the                                 judgments but that it requires less                                 effort let's see and then what                                 there is also bad things relevance is                                 very subjective from the to an order of                                 course and hard to scale and might be                                 expensive okay we have the judgments                                 next step is to enrich those judgments                                 with features and we are ain't go you                                 went for three types of features we have                                 query document features business metric                                 features and document features what I                                 mean                                 document features three standard we were                                 using last search so we collect the pin                                                                                                   relevant for our domain with moot match                                 combinations like best field cross field                                 across those text fields business                                 metrics we decide to include the raw                                 business metrics by metrics that                                 represent our conversion of funeral                                 let's say so include clicks books                                 impressions but also rates like CTR CR                                 and document features in our case                                 attribute a active attribute like price                                 the duration number of reviews and also                                 categories that the document belongs to                                 in our case it might be tickets tours                                 walking tours many things and then we                                 decide to build a data pipeline like we                                 want to be maybe people decide should                                 build a data pipeline while did this                                 because is if you consider the out CR                                 cycle we have three main steps very very                                 similar to any machine learning problem                                 we always can have a new idea of a new                                 feature that you you want to include and                                 have a training set and then you okay                                 you have a new training set to have to                                 molecule trainer mode and value eight                                 but you can also have an another feature                                 so you do that cycle many times probably                                 you do many times you have multiple                                 features and then when you go through                                 each of these steps well solve it as                                 reliable so invest some time we should                                 build a pipeline and also surface                                 reproducible in terms of like last week                                 if you have a good model for a feature                                 set you want to have the same results so                                 should be reproducible and if you have                                 if you manage it you have like a very                                 few human intervention you can to write                                 faster in this so you build our first                                 pipeline our first pipeline works like                                 this we receive a judgment list our                                 populated by the expert and then receive                                 a configuration file when you say the                                 features and the versions of the this                                 that feature set you sent this finished                                 your data breaks we have a job running                                 on data bricks topper spark and then we                                 data bricks in some quest to score                                 features hola search but one thing here                                 is like he in this approach it feature                                 is a query basically that to help to                                 send you a search because there were                                 couple true that the actual user cray so                                 I have many requests happening here and                                 but okay but we we managed to collect                                 all these features we have a training                                 set with training validation model and                                 then we have a model and then when the                                 user comes search for Eiffel Tower we                                 had to do it while I have to do it too                                 heavy to with Corrigan your features                                 because they are totally related to the                                 query and then is acute the model so if                                 the model is linear you said like some                                 fishing boats is good but imagine that                                 is a complex model here like a decision                                 tree we have somehow fetched documents                                 for a search and reprocess this and then                                 sent back to the code to the user after                                 this first pipeline we had some problems                                 our boat was not safe as expected                                 like we managed to request last search                                 was complicated                                 we had some trials of                                                                                                                         million queries centralist search wait                                 we can batch we can paralyze but                                 although it is                                                         version of training set was a problem                                 for us because you have a pipeline but                                 was like we recur we needed some humans                                 you say okay this is the version for                                 this feature set as I mentioned is a                                 cute complex modern paradigm it's kind                                 of complicated                                 modern you for this tool the algae are                                 plugging developed by open source                                 connections take for the initiative we                                 if this plugin you can use the break                                 living XD boots a boost a very standard                                 and good tools for LTR and with this                                 plugin it helped us in in these two main                                 things ever if you display your Kindle                                 Store and and features and models inside                                 the last search and version then so when                                 you need                                 poor to collect the judgments now is                                 simpler because everything's the last                                 search you don't need it to create a                                 place for our side ok say ok a last                                 search is called this simple this pair                                 of query and document using the feature                                 set V                                                                   for you all the judgment at once so is                                 fewer question last search so I decide                                 to add this to our in your pipeline and                                 then you had this we receive the                                 judgment the configuration file data                                 breaks and fewer Christ's natural a                                 search and you have a training set and                                 then we train validator model at this                                 time we have to just the only this type                                 is manual well it's - yeah but yet but                                 we can automate it we we upload the                                 model the best model in your last search                                 and then in the users search first                                 Eiffel Tower in this case we just have                                 to say okay use mod of V                                                search knows that mod of V                                           Future Sight V                                                         the results what is good about our                                 pipeline we with this we could iterate                                 faster to give new date set the version                                 of models and feature sets were easier                                 now and simply see to run it's not                                 automated flow entering but was good                                 enough for us ok so we have a training                                 set the next steps the next step                                 actually is to training validate a model                                 let's recap our boss we want a                                 reasonable model for location page for                                 the actual guide location page we want                                 this model should have a mixture of                                 relevance text relevance metrics and                                 miss this matrix we made sure that we                                 have features for covering both metrics                                 and we decide to have a valuation met at                                 NDC G at                                                               location page at the moment and for the                                 business for majnu's success success in                                 business / in the business perspective                                 we decide to use to measure the city our                                 and we have some constraints we are not                                 including                                 user features like gender age from where                                 the user came so similar so things like                                 that and you build a pipeline again our                                 pipeline now we should train test models                                 is simpler than the other one we you                                 receive here the the training test set                                 and you have some model type and                                 configurations is also another                                 configuration file in this view one we                                 decide to use ranked lib so in this                                 configuration file we have to receive                                 the model type that you want to try and                                 then the configurations for example we                                 can use random forests so a                                 configuration would be the number of                                 trees for example so we receive both                                 things our mod rank Lib model trainer                                 and then you we what you did we                                 distributed ring clip on spark so we run                                 this on spark cluster the model                                 transient collected many models equation                                 results so ok and outside the two bricks                                 we have a module here out your model                                 valuate who fetches results the                                 configuration file and analyzed output                                 ends and for that round for let's try                                 that's interation returns the best model                                 so what is good and bad about this                                 pipeline you can tell it faster to try                                 new models and automated models                                 evaluations also optimize it but the                                 problem here is we had some overhead                                 choose to put wrinkly we shouldn't do                                 the head we could use oxygen boost we                                 wait for ring clip at the time because                                 you didn't have expertise in actually                                 beautiful model make a documentation and                                 previous experience with ring clip and                                 one bad thing about reg leave as well                                 that we found in our case was to analyze                                 the future importance the output                                 execution output a file from link Lib                                 and then we have a best view one model                                 the best model was a lambda March model                                 it was not a surprise like this three                                 models are like very common and maybe                                 the best solutions for those problems                                 pretty good in CJ                                                        features that the model included and                                 makes total sense for our business we                                 have query document features like title                                 right lights description base if you'd                                 mood match with cover well or writin we                                 have business metaphor I click the books                                 impression see our covers our conversion                                 funnel and I have document features like                                 number of reviews will be rating your                                 price by seller are features that to                                 believe that are good for customers you                                 take this issue okay you got a model                                 just each run production right but not                                 so easy                                 we did some offline evaluation and you                                 don't go to production and tell me why                                 basically the best we want you to work                                 we it works from showing you so for some                                 use case but forehead cards let's say                                 most important search keywords didn't                                 work this example my favorite example                                 Eiffel Tower skip the line ticket very                                 important keyword for us we have here on                                 the left the current rank on the right                                 the rank generated by the model I start                                 to analyze the linear inks this first                                 one I our second-floor part axis                                 Orson I submit ticket it is very                                 relevant for this query like provide                                 priority access and skip the line are                                 synonymous but we can see that this                                 document is not here it's very bad for                                 the no allocation page the second                                 example Eiffel Tower dinner with River                                 Chris like to have a dinner or have to                                 probably being Eiffel Tower but didn't                                 mention anything about skip the line one                                 last example                                 this should shooter is two activities                                 here Paris city tour and keep your line                                 I fought Arctic so let's keep the knife                                 what our ticket but this is not only                                 skip the line of authority kit so the                                 price is a little bit higher because                                 it's a bundle these two things in one                                 it's a is relevant result but not sure                                 if if you need to be ranked so high for                                 this keyword as you have high                                 Tainted customers that customer search                                 for only this not sure if this is                                 relevant for the customer and the show                                 this price on a landing page on a                                 location page and then we had a lot of                                 tough lessons learned it I like to cover                                 some lessons the main ones like                                 relevance of results for this page and                                 problems that we've found the font the                                 judgment lists extractions we'll learn                                 some things about this the pilot of your                                 eyes and the distribution of our                                 judgments so after this bad result is                                 offline valuation we start to question                                 ourselves what is relevance for our                                 business let's recap over the case we                                 were talking about location page for us                                 is the first point of contact of many                                 visitors so a previous page you have                                 very few ranked positions to change the                                 premium space there have like                                          business metrics matter always matters                                 but for those pages will receive a paid                                 traffic of revenue matters a lot and                                 then you used on may Express labeling we                                 asked them to do a simple very simple                                 task we said ok for this keyword in this                                 location and this document were relevant                                 to this so it's very limited scope join                                 in that scope the answer is very simple                                                                                                        documented potation conversion my                                 blowing is possible to know that only                                 this is limited scope so that's why we                                 should maybe consider since v                                            like a date approach desired cohere                                 bison duels on the ends i had very good                                 arguments i about apply learn rank for                                 e-commerce and then it basically tells                                 that there was like ok if you want to                                 measure relevance for commerce                                 let's redefining the what is right what                                 is relevance for e-commerce like                                 irrelevant relevance for commerce not                                 text read text relevance might be                                 relevant but also something that                                 covers all your conversion funnel and                                 then it suggests you to also in the                                 concept of measuring the relevance                                 consider things like okay you are a                                 customer you search and then in search                                 page let's say you click in this product                                 so click-through rate might be                                 indication of relevance if you move                                 forward to product page I'm a Jew card                                 this is even more relevant and if you                                 end up conversion is it even more evil                                 relevance                                 there are many challenge here like                                 mostly like okay is different dimensions                                 like the number of people who click in a                                 document of course and then Add to Cart                                 and converse is very sparse later but he                                 raised some good things that we did                                 include but looking you could also                                 include this and experts can help us to                                 define should define business math                                 wizard refine our judgments another                                 thing that we learned it is the quality                                 of queries we didn't consider the REO                                 you spray but the keywords the search                                 keywords the the search engine matches                                 like let's say that we search engine                                 here's Google so a customer went and                                 went to google and type like I thought                                 our cheap options at night we didn't get                                 the full thing we lost some content we                                 we got what using Google matches to show                                 our ads so we got something start of                                 Liberty ticket to ask let's keep the                                 line ticket and another thing that we                                 learn it is this in the beginning okay                                 you say you have a we have a rich gray                                 we have the locations and the intentions                                 but we decide to use these in a pond                                 test of a location page so this keyword                                 was use it for measure the relevance of                                 this cue world instead of Liberty page                                 so of course all the products there are                                 about stat of Liberty but you didn't                                 clean up this from the play so we end up                                 scoring the Fuquay                                 so as a result we have some many cases                                 when the document that are more relevant                                 the model things that the models are                                 more relevant are the more those who                                 have best been                                                         of the full thing but because of this                                 so this is useless for us we should use                                 the only the intention there is to push                                 off judgments something that we've been                                 reading about a lot                                                important that you have like the people                                 are saying like more negative results of                                 course the pain of your bees in the pain                                 of the model but in general the                                 guideline and in the brigade aggregated                                 data we have this distribution of                                 judgments if you consider here the                                 things that are more relevant then                                 figures that are not relevant we have                                    percent here and                                                        almost have binary relevance your knife                                 in the middle is the variegated data                                 value if you go through page by page you                                 can see that this distribution remains                                 if you consider the dark color things                                 that are irrelevant and white color like                                 orange here not relevant it page you see                                 this pattern happen in some pages we                                 also we have only one example of those                                 good thing this is very bad because                                 known location paste the items we have                                 are very similar so what differentiates                                 our adopt me to another sometimes is a                                 little thing like they did the duration                                 so because they are about the same thing                                 they are about the location and our data                                 the data that you show the MA didn't                                 reflect this so as we had wind-ups                                 having been binary relevance and in each                                 page we see the same pattern happen so                                 this very bad an interesting to know                                 that everything is somehow connected we                                 had sufficient criteria to judge was not                                 the expert or the judges fault but our                                 fault to define the task we said ok were                                 irrelevant is this document for this                                 query not only that and also sent to the                                 experts low diversity cries we didn't                                 have the what user actually type but                                 what they searching matches so we lost                                 some rich information so that could have                                 the experts to have a conclusion about                                 the document and the experts dude                                 everything and end up having these                                 judgments like judgments that are not so                                 balanced and as a show and no match no                                 business match because were considered                                 because you didn't ask them to do it                                 which is ask it in this scope of                                 relevance                                 how good are the document and then we                                 send both wings to our LTI pipeline so                                 the judgments and the queries and                                 queries here had another problem which                                 is as I mentioned we didn't clean up or                                 Christ properly so we send some location                                 that works as a noise for our scorer so                                 if both things we had a model with some                                 problems okay so yeah I run so for a                                 future why do you want to do it we                                 definitely want to cover all this                                 product so we want to collect judging                                 from data at least to make sure if the                                 experts judgment or if you manage it you                                 also we we define our criteria to                                 measure relevance and and collect for                                 experts in this case like myself it                                 might be something interesting but when                                 I should try is like okay use data you                                 have to use our data refined then later                                 with the experts labeling we could apply                                 out here and other search features like                                 all the things that have been read is                                 full text search we didn't go for full                                 text search because we had this need in                                 our location page where the problem was                                 also more complex and we'd want to                                 extracting tensions for the keywords                                 like in full text search in our full                                 text search okay we will have a base                                 quite understanding model that clean up                                 the location we didn't apply then before                                 send to the model and this view one so                                 could do it if you use keyword and also                                 another                                 message years to judge the judgments                                 more often not point fingers but check                                 distribution and like men may make a lot                                 of good SN checks before having a twin                                 set because the most important part of                                 your maybe your problem your project                                 so my final message that you need to                                 keep sailing you know you keep Sayle and                                 that's it thank you very much                                 any questions                                 hi a fairly simple question was it worth                                 it do you some increase in Revelation no                                 wait did I put this modern production                                 but we had some good learnings like in                                 this process of understand what is bad                                 for our model we come up with is OK                                 location might not be interesting so                                 before this project we try to introduce                                 text metrics in your ranking but without                                 machine learning but never try to                                 extract intentions so by learning your                                 why the model didn't work we could                                 identify that could be a reason and you                                 had a rape test to run and evaluate this                                 in factored form other also it works in                                 that it was not like a project of like a                                 year it was like a quarter it was bad                                 and like a quarter is a lot of time but                                 it could be worst and then this learn is                                 that you collected which you have the                                 pipeline's working so where which would                                 be easier but I know your point like for                                 the business perspective yep                                 so I understood from your answer now                                 that you didn't put this model to                                 production no this particular one no                                 because we we did some offline                                 evaluation in your head queries and we                                 like with our product manager analyze                                 some results that are important for                                 the newcomers decision that was not good                                 enough for going to production with this                                 model so we did after this we like                                 missed with the project like you                                 conscience but so far he's not using his                                 modern production we had as I said with                                 the learner's we will come up with a lot                                 of a/b tests that implemented and                                 improve our ranking but not without here                                 how long do you think it's going to take                                 you guys to finish this and actually                                 deliver something to production in terms                                 of technical things implemented nothing                                 the problem for us that this we                                 strawberry fist was the use case like                                 you come up with the conclusion that the                                 use case might not be the best one for a                                 plant you are in our business like we                                 could have this with another approach                                 maybe try to redefine and as I mentioned                                 the criteria for what is relevant for us                                 or try to apply this for other such                                 features like full-text search but in                                 terms of technical implementation you                                 don't have those issues problems to                                 choose ship in the module thank you very                                 much I think it's a lot for the talk I                                 like your conclusion that the the task                                 you gave to the expert really mattered                                 in instead of getting maybe not quite                                 the right results for you you mentioned                                 that you collected I think thirty                                 thousand judgments from people how did                                 you decide which sort of pairs of query                                 and a location item document to even                                 present to people that you randomly                                 choose did you have a pre selection and                                 that maybe also make a difference in                                 your result we decide to we strike the                                 dose at keyword and combination of locus                                 that had the highest demand from our ad                                 machine let's say so I went this we                                 enter our data then you pick those cases                                 that are more important for the business                                 likely we have many location page we we                                 know that for sure some affect the                                 business or not and then you had our had                                 we collect all done now                                 then and we get our or head queries or                                 the quasi turn more apart for the                                 business and then for those subsets we                                 have some randomization but we also but                                 all the choirs that you choose was quite                                 as that are relevant for a business the                                 documents for the queries were also the                                 relevant documents already or where they                                 randomly picked documents a good                                 question we randomly pick the top b                                   document of a note wait for top                                    documents and then for it for a for it                                 expert to show                                                         was just wondering if you considered                                 maybe I don't know if it's possible or                                 not to gather the judgments like I don't                                 know it matically from the logs from                                 click-through rates or something like                                 that or if it was too much of a hassle                                 because it's always terrible to have                                 manual people like sitting there and                                 like please evaluate evaluate I don't                                 know yeah we give you one we didn't like                                 for v                                                                   approach of okay let's go to our data                                 and then okay combine click-through rate                                 and conversion rate we're doing that                                 right now and also define later maybe                                 the expert of maybe with the business                                 rules that matters for this page and                                 then have a new judgments and throw in                                 our pipeline and have new models that we                                 are considering with that for v                                      other questions                                 in that case thank you very much again                                 thank you guys                                 [Applause]
