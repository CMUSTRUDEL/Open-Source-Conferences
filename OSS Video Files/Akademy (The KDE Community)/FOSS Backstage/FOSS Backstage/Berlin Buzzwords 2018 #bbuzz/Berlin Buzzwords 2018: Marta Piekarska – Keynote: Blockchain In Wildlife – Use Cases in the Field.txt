	                              so welcome everybody my name is Marta P                               carska as you could see I'm director of                               ecosystem for Hyper ledger in the Linux                               Foundation and I will explain a bit                               later what does that mean and why do we                               have that weird system I've been about                               four years in the blockchain space they                               say that blockchain space you have to                               count the years in blockchain like                                dunkey years so it's times seven so I                                guess I've been what                                                   is only one year shorter than I've been                                living in general so that's it I will                                give you a brief overview of what Linux                                Foundation is and how does it tie to                                hyper ledger or how hyper load your ties                                to it and then we'll go into a bit more                                detail of what people do with blockchain                                how many of you have familiarity with                                blockchain okay so for fair amount                                they're great so let's start with that                                you probably asked people that are                                dealing more with big data and data                                analysis know Linux Foundation Linux                                Foundation is much more than just Linux                                we were actually set up                                                bring enterprises together and help them                                work and collaborate on various projects                                that deliver open-source solutions we                                provide the governance the marketing PR                                support legal infrastructure we                                ourselves don't develop any code we are                                kind of that big house that hosts all of                                the projects what started with core                                Linux                                                              different projects and okay how many of                                you know kubernetes okay so this is a                                Linux Foundation project nodejs                                similarly a Linux Foundation project but                                also we have projects you've never heard                                about probably like the automotive grade                                Linux actually most of BMWs used the                                automotive grade Linux and we also have                                drone project which I've kind of I know                                I'm very excited about it so two years                                ago people started coming to us and                                saying hey you know have you heard about                                this whole thing called Bitcoin and                                Jim's Emlyn our executive director Linux                                Foundation said yeah I do read                                newspapers so of course I heard about                                Bitcoin but then the question was what                                does Linux Foundation want to do with                                with Bitcoin and we said Bitcoin does                                not fit the model that works well with                                Linux Foundation it doesn't have we                                couldn't be able to create a project                                that will help bring the enterprises                                together to collaborate on an                                open-source framework however the                                underlying technology blockchain has a                                very huge very big potential so hyper                                ledger was set up as an open-source                                collaborative effort to advance the                                cross industry blockchain technologies                                and of course we are a linux project                                which basically kind of provides the                                infrastructure the the governance model                                for companies that want to develop                                blockchain based frameworks what is                                important is that we focus on enterprise                                great block chains so not the public                                permission less once but rather on the                                ones that can really help enterprises                                and today we started off two years ago                                as I said with                                                                                                                                unknown number of open source developers                                that just contribute to the project and                                they you really have applications in                                every major industry so what is the                                vision of hyper ledger we really think                                that blockchain promises to change the                                way that businesses are conducted but                                there will not be one blockchain to rule                                them all if you hope that I'll tell you                                now that the theorem will die and only                                hyper ledger fabric were winners                                thing like that no this is not the case                                bitcoin aetherium Z cache hyper ledger                                framework scored a quorum all these                                these frameworks will coexist we hope so                                at least                                to help enterprises and similar to Linux                                Foundation we decided coming from the                                premise that there won't be one                                blockchain to roll them all to use that                                green house concept so in the next in                                Linux Foundation we have a green house                                 of ideas for different projects in every                                 major industry in hyper ledger we are                                 the community stewardship and the                                 technological legal and marketing as I                                 said kind of flight controllers if you                                 will but anyone can come to us and say I                                 have an idea can I plant it in your                                 green house and if the community takes                                 it up and wants to develop it as with                                 any open-source project out there we                                 will obviously be very happy to help                                 host it we started off with two projects                                 it was hyper ledger fabric and hyper                                 ledger soldiers today we have five                                 different frameworks and five different                                 tools we I guess briefly just can tell                                 you that these frameworks are                                 differentiated and the governance model                                 and the consensus mechanisms that they                                 use and they all can be applied very                                 broadly so hyper ledger borrow is an                                 implementation of the etherium virtual                                 machine on ten German so it strips down                                 the token side of things it strips down                                 the currency and looks at the etherium                                 smart contracts and virtual machine and                                 how this can be applied to enterprises                                 and borrow is now actually being collabo                                 collaborating and being module doubt so                                 that it you can actually write so the                                 smart contracts both and hyper ledger                                 fabric and hyper ledger Psaltis hyper                                 ledger fabric might be our most famous                                 project                                 that has been going on it's now in                                 almost in version                                                released very soon it supports both                                 aetherium solidity smart contracts and                                 the chain code which is a native native                                 code that was written for fabric all                                 fabric is written in go out of our                                 languages do now you can write your                                 business side of logic in other                                 languages like Java and JavaScript it                                 uses a consensus mechanism called Kafka                                 which is crash fault tolerant consensus                                 hyper ledger indie is the community's                                 response to identity issue I'm not sure                                 if you're aware the fact that                                     billion people in the world do not have                                 any kind of identity document that's                                 mostly leads to things like human                                 trafficking and not being able to                                 identify people this also leads to                                 problems whenever you're subject to                                 crime you can't report it because                                 countries don't recognize you and if you                                 flee a country obviously all of your                                 education all of your background is lost                                 because we are basing it on documents                                 there are paper documents that you just                                 want to destroy so Indy looks at how can                                 we store private information and deliver                                 identity solutions through the                                 blockchain that will be immutable                                 because that's one of the biggest things                                 about blockchain but also in a safe and                                 secure way India is also used by the                                 government of Philippines which I'll                                 talk a bit more about and some projects                                 with no your clients and banking then we                                 have hyper ledger                                 Aroha which is a project coming mostly                                 from the Asian countries where they are                                 focusing on mobile payments and very                                 lightweight applications                                 Aroha is written in C++ because we                                 really need a tight memory control and                                 is really very lightweight very                                 applicable and then finally we have                                 hyper ledger Sawtooth which is our                                 second production ready code hyper                                 ledger Salters this is a very                                 interesting consensus mechanism called                                 poet proof of elapsed time that executes                                 the consensus in the trusted execution                                 environment and it's kind of a                                 turnaround from Bitcoin consensus the                                 proof of work where here you the person                                 that or the entity that gets to put                                 things on the blockchain is the one that                                 wins lottery by being allocated the                                 least amount of time execution time so                                 instead of putting a lot of energy and a                                 lot of effort into finding a solution to                                 the riddle which effectively proof of                                 work is where poet does the opposite it                                 says who will spend the least amount of                                 time on things and then we have tools                                 cello composer and Explorer are three                                 tools that allow you to deploy                                 investigate and analyze what is                                 happening on your block chain and then                                 caliper is a benchmarking platform which                                 everyone got really excited about it's                                 our youngest project because it really                                 allows you to stress test your networks                                 and finally hyper ledger quilt coming                                 from entity and ripple it is the                                 intelligible implementation in Java so                                 as I mentioned we kind of decided when                                 we started hyper ledger that we strongly                                 believe that blockchain is not crypto                                 currency actually blockchain technology                                 has been around for much longer than                                 Bitcoin itself first mentioning zuv                                 blockchain and time stamping with                                 blockchain are from the                                                 wrote their manifesto in ninety I                                 believe to                                                           were built were built on top or hell                                 to build VidCon debt cryptocurrency is                                 an application that sits on top of                                 blockchain but on top of blockchain we                                 can put many more things so because this                                 talk is not very long I figured that                                 I'll put this slide up and if you Google                                 these                                                            remember what they mean obviously I                                 promise you that you can hold a fairly                                 normal cone or informed conversation                                 with people in the space it is about                                 consensus mechanism it is about security                                 and cryptography so there are some some                                 concepts that there are obviously no                                 very well known zero knowledge proof SAR                                 in maths known for ages shaft                                        course as well then there of course                                 ledger concepts like mining blocks forks                                 that are very confusing because we don't                                 have a common language or common                                 translations of those things so people                                 get confused and for of course we have                                 very specific platform concepts like                                 nodes Oracle's or smart contracts were                                 why enterprises really want blockchain                                 because it provides that transparency                                 immutability and really security by                                      the World Economic Forum predicts that                                                                                                          on and distributed on the blockchain the                                 blog business blockchain technologies                                 provided very interesting platform for                                 storing information for distributing                                 information but also depending on how                                 you deal with it you have different                                 features that you can leverage so you                                 probably have heard about the                                 permissions and permission less                                 blockchains and public and private the                                 differences are very simple in terms of                                 permission versus permission less it is                                 who can write to a blockchain so imagine                                 this conference right                                 this is a permissioned blockchain                                 conference if you will because we all                                 had to register and buy tickets we need                                 a permission to enter this room right                                 but it if you look at pride public                                 versus private it is about who can read                                 from a blockchain information during                                 this conference will be distributed over                                 the internet anyone will be able to                                 download without even prior registration                                 we will not track who is looking at that                                 information right so this is why it's a                                 public conference now in terms of                                 blockchain and coming back to that the                                 question would be you know why do you                                 need permission or permission less                                 blockchain well I like to give the other                                 side of spectrum example medical records                                 it is a very popular case that                                 blockchain is nowadays used for sharing                                 and storing the medical information                                 because of the at the stations that you                                 can make to it and the security of it                                 however if I would tell you that anyone                                 here can access my medical data and you                                 know you didn't quite like my talk so                                 you'll add a bit of hepatitis C to my                                 records well that doesn't really work                                 right I want to keep that information                                 private also only certain people should                                 be simply able to see if I have that                                 hepatitis or not right it's my private                                 information and that's why medical                                 records are being used on a permissioned                                 private network network of hospitals                                 doctors and patients but then there's                                 middle ground so for instance land                                 titles or university degrees where                                 anyone should be able to check if I do                                 hold the PhD from Technical University                                 of Berlin because I made a claim like                                 that but only Technical University of                                 Berlin obviously should be able to issue                                 that certificate and said that I passed                                 the exams right so that's the the ground                                 now the block chain has blockchain                                 technologies have been adopted by almost                                 every industry today but if you look at                                 the you know famous the                                 of innovation curve it is different                                 stages so financial technologies are                                 definitely in the innovators space they                                 jumped on it very early on and not                                 necessarily for cryptocurrencies I would                                 say that cryptocurrencies there is at                                 least popular application and FinTech                                 it's more for the reconciliation on a                                 blockchain of transactions and real-time                                 transactions then we have things like                                 supply chain or healthcare which I would                                 say are the early adopters to in                                      we're seeing more and more actual                                 deployments rather than just proof of                                 concepts and then we have the logistics                                 insurance and governments which are just                                 catching up but they are catching up in                                 an extreme speed there are two hundred                                 and three different implementations of                                 blockchain technologies in government                                 space all over the world                                 Netherlands smart Dubai or Dubai                                 Singapore Estonia obviously are the                                 leading countries there where in smart                                 Dubai which is one of the members of                                 hyper ledger we they have identified                                    different citizen's stories or                                 applications and by                                               planning to move everything that has to                                 do with citizens on a blockchain so all                                 information the way that you process                                 information also things like payment                                 gateways all of this goes through                                 blockchain but to be honest I mean you                                 know I'm very hyped about blockchain in                                 some ways but I'm the last person to                                 tell you the blockchain will solve your                                 all of your problems I really like this                                 xkcd because we as technologists as                                 engineers tend to get over excited about                                 engineering and about algorithm so we                                 want to sprinkle that on everything well                                 it doesn't work that way some problems                                 are much bigger and harder and we need                                 that cold showers sometimes to endure                                 stand-up as I mentioned you know we                                 launched two years ago we are a very                                 growing community there are ways to                                 become engaged with hyper ledger that do                                 not work or actually everything in hyper                                 ledger is completely open-source and it                                 is not pay to play so you can can go                                 download the code today start deploying                                 with it playing around and so on we have                                 active community working groups if                                 you're not that technical you can come                                 and join us on calls about health care                                 about performance and scalability about                                 governance I'm currently working with a                                 team and please let me know if you're                                 interested in social impact of                                 blockchain because we are trying to find                                 places there and of course identity is                                 one of the bigger ones just in the                                 matter of time I'll skip these slides                                 and go but already here because that's                                 more interesting what are people doing                                 with blockchain why why are they so                                 interested and excited about it first of                                 all we see a spectrum of Industry use                                 Casas because there is a need for a                                 decentralization trust and continuity                                 that confirms over time now one                                 important thing is that to recognize                                 that there is a difference between                                 decentralization and distribution                                 systems like the distributed ledger                                 technologies can be or should be                                 distributed so it should be spread out                                 across different servers across                                 different platforms but there is quite                                 often a certain need for centralization                                 on a blockchain for governance purposes                                 you have to sometimes you have nodes                                 that are stronger than the others                                 and I know this is something that is                                 extremely controversial because in                                 Bitcoin space you have truly                                 decentralized distributed system but for                                 enterprises you very often need a                                 certain level of governance because                                 things go wrong I mean we've seen it                                 already that                                 wallets get hacked that people lose                                 money and Dow and how do you revert back                                 that's only can be done through some                                 kind of a governance and agreement                                 process                                 one of the first implementations that                                 we've seen was interstate Medical                                 Licensing where the challenge was to                                 share information about licenses and                                 claims they are who claims processes                                 that is that needs increase transparency                                 and Trust because these are multiple                                 doctrine only makes sense if you have                                 multiple distrustful parties that need                                 to exchange information and that trust                                 it normally in world today it's kind of                                 implied if I want to borrow money from                                 you there you have to trust me right                                 that I'll give you the money we can make                                 right contracts and so on but at the end                                 of the day we have to trust each other                                 to a certain degree which is not normal                                 people do not want to trust each other                                 just by the sheer fact that we've met                                 even worse in terms of companies people                                 quite often don't meet so that trust is                                 what blockchain really helps with                                 another interesting example is in food                                 industry food industry is really                                 leveraging blockchain very widely and                                 very is very excited about it because                                 food trust is one of the weakest points                                 in general this is an example of a                                 seafood movement there is a company in                                 China that recently joined hyper ledger                                 called JD and JD is tracking bananas on                                 a blockchain so you can actually scan                                 your banana bar a barcode and check                                 where it comes from what's the                                 provenance because in China the honesty                                 in food or food like the provenance of                                 food is very rare you can actually like                                 buy eggs and it turns out the American                                 aid of plastic and things like that it's                                 incredible what is half                                 their rice and pork are also tracked                                 through blockchain today to make sure                                 that pork that has been delivered to                                 your house is healthy it's it's clean it                                 has the certification needed in this                                 case what I really like about it and now                                 pause here for a moment is the                                 recognition that blockchain can just                                 help solve part of the problem but will                                 not solve it all and it can really                                 improve what the living today but it                                 won't just solve all of your problems                                 and here's how it works                                 so fishermen logs into his boat through                                 a system and again this system has to be                                 secure it has to be designed completely                                 separately from a blockchain but you                                 have some kind of another thing                                 authentication method where a fisherman                                 logs into his boat and goes off to fish                                 right now we install we are able to                                 install IOT devices that were track                                 where the boat is and how heavy their                                 nets are that picked the fish so that we                                 know how much fish was caught and where                                 was it caught so it was sustainable or                                 not of course again the IOT devices and                                 the whole server side of things has to                                 be built securely and that doesn't                                 matter if it's of doctrine or not lock                                 chains technology we put that                                 information on a blockchain to know that                                 this batch of fish was caught in a                                 sustainable way in a certain place as                                 the fisherman comes to to the to the                                 port again keep the fish's unloaded to a                                 truck-a container                                 dead container has monitoring system                                 that allows you to verify what are the                                 conditions and time and path that fish                                 went from the port to your LD or Qaddafi                                 now when the fish arrives to the                                 restaurant to the supermarket wherever                                 and if it is spoiled in some way we are                                 able to verify if it was too warm in the                                 truck if it took too long time or maybe                                 the fish was poisoned altogether from                                 the very beginning because there                                 some poisoning and the see if such thing                                 happens we are able to execute smart                                 contract in a way that does not that                                 removes all of the dispute and insurance                                 that can be paid directly to the people                                 that should get their money all of this                                 means that the audit ability drops                                 there's still need for auditors but it                                 is not you know all the things the                                 auditor the auditor the cost of the                                 whole thing is lower because we have                                 lower food waste the restaurants can                                 plan how many portions of sustainable                                 fish will they be able to to give to                                 people and so the cost of a sustainably                                 caught salmon or tuna dropped down which                                 means that all of us are inclined to buy                                 a sustainable tuna versus non                                 sustainable tuna because they are                                 basically the same price which means                                 that we are improving the ecology                                 because now everyone's gonna go for the                                 sustainable one rather than non                                 sustainable one so that's a really                                 interesting thing how technology can                                 really go back and help us and we can                                 help kind of build technologies that                                 save the world and call me cheesy but I                                 do like improving the world of it but                                 also it shows how much of other factors                                 you have to think about when building a                                 solution diamond supply chain is another                                 interesting example because this is a                                 place where technology brought this                                 system with there was purely paper-based                                 so traders of diamonds in coming from                                 Africa all the way to Amsterdam where                                 the biggest hub is decided to go with                                 the solution proverb proposed or                                 suggested by ever ledger where this                                 amazing incredible woman that a CEO of                                 ever ledger just came to them and said                                 look and now I've so offer you a                                 solution where you can track of diamonds                                 who are from honest areas and what is                                 the quality of diamonds that you're                                 getting and that the one that you bought                                 Africa is the same diamond that comes to                                 you but you have to adopt this                                 technology and now I think something                                 like                                                                   on a blockchain digital identity is                                 something that I discussed already and                                 talked a bit I promise to tell you                                     of Filipinos are only using bank                                 accounts today that's because we don't                                 know how to do know your clients in                                 countries like Philippines so they've                                 partnered with hyper ledger in D and                                 Amihan to build a solution that allows                                 you to verify the honesty of your                                 clients and and if their record of                                 banking green assets management is                                 another example of how can you track the                                 co                                                                    really collaborate and finally let's see                                 I want to make sure that I get to the                                 interesting yeah so real estate is will                                 be the last example that I talked about                                 again if anyone ever tried buying a                                 house you know how horrible it is and                                 how many offices do you have to go to                                 bed with blockchain gets solved because                                 offices it is a common misconception                                 that governments and institutions                                 without within governments trust each                                 other right because it's one government                                 well no they don't they don't you're not                                 able to track the records they are not                                 able to verify what is happening so this                                 is a system that allows you to really                                 track that and speed up the process of                                 buying or selling a house now all of                                 that shows one thing which is we really                                 need collaboration a blockchain and this                                 is one of the things that is hampering                                 today's process of exploration the                                 blockchain space because we are not able                                 to convince                                 enterprises or enterprises are not                                 convinced that they can collaborate in a                                 safe way so this is the next big step in                                 the next problem how do we collaborate                                 because doing proof-of-concept in your                                 back office and proving that blockchain                                 tech works yeah it does but if you want                                 to really use it and deploy it and scale                                 it up you need partners from various                                 enterprises from various open source                                 industries and then you have to kind of                                 trust the technology not trust people                                 but trust the technology to kind of help                                 you if because I saw that some people or                                 there was a big group here that is not                                 very familiar with blockchain we have                                 launched a course there is a free                                 open-source online course on EDX                                 platform like Coursera or like many                                 others where which takes you from what                                 blockchain is and what are the different                                 aspects of blockchain all the way to the                                 last stages are coding exercises on how                                 to deploy your blockchain based on hyper                                 let your fabric and base of hyper ledger                                 Psaltis so it's a really you know open                                 to everyone                                 course that I suggest you take if you're                                 interested in the blockchain space and                                 then one last thing in Basel and yeah in                                 December it will be very cold I can                                 promise you that but it won't be that                                 much colder than in Berlin we are we                                 have we are hosting an open event an                                 open conference for everyone and we hope                                 that by                                                                lot of use cases and deployments and                                 this conference is really focused on                                 deployment so we are putting a strong                                 effort on both business and                                 technological tracks to talk about what                                 what people are doing so with that I'll                                 finish we still have like two more                                 minutes so I'll take some questions and                                 if not I'm around I'm wearing a spotty                                 dress so it's easy to find me in the                                 break and I can't see you so I don't                                 know if there are any questions                                 I don't think they are awesome oh yeah                                 here yeah so there are projects like                                 kubernetes yeah like open network                                 solution open network on app and of                                 course yeah we Linux Foundation House                                 and doesn't pick and choose which                                 project is better than the other we                                 treat all of our children equally                                 so if you want to get engaged with                                 projects on databases and centralized                                 databases that's absolutely fine in fact                                 in many cases when people come to hyper                                 ledger and say we want to develop with                                 hyper ledger frameworks we said do you                                 really need a blockchain maybe maybe                                 there is another solution because there                                 are downsides to blockchain okay since I                                 don't see any more questions                                 oh there is one okay go on or not okay                                 oh there I see one in the back                                 yes so the way that it works on a                                 blockchain the question was how do you                                 deal with disappearing resources                                 blockchain does not allow for deletion                                 in any way once you put something on a                                 blockchain it stays for an R on a                                 blockchain forever so that's the upside                                 of it it provides immutability but it is                                 also the downside of this because you                                 have to predict what will be the                                 consequences of putting information on a                                 blockchain in ten                                                       is one of the big questions about                                 identity because if we put private                                 information on a blockchain it will last                                 forever which means that we can you know                                 play around with encryption you can do                                 all that magic but encryption gets                                 broken all the time and so maybe and now                                 it's safe but in ten years time people                                 will be able to see like break the                                 encryption and see your very private                                 information now maybe in ten years time                                 it won't be as valuable but maybe there                                 are things about you that you don't want                                 to reveal ever to anyone that doesn't                                 like that you don't give them access to                                 it right you don't want that information                                 to become public does that answer your                                 question                                 no there is no there are ways to                                 deprecate the the blockchain right not                                 to prevent it from blowing up                                 information but blockchain is not a                                 database it is an immutable record of                                 events rather than immutable database                                 which is a also a common thing you don't                                 you should not be putting as much                                 information on a blockchain because                                 that's not what it is for it is it                                 should serve as an attestation process                                 rather than a storage process if you put                                 wrong information on a blockchain so you                                 know make a claim that is not true what                                 you can do is you can amend changes and                                 say well this information that I put                                 there is incorrect I'm introducing a                                 delta a change but you don't remove that                                 information embrace it with a new one                                 okay thank you everyone it was a                                 pleasure to not see you I guess                                 [Applause]
