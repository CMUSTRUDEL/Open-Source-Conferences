Publication date: 2018-06-13
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2018 #bbuzz
Description: 
	There’s a lot of excitement and growing interest in machine learning, even in mainstream business practice. The Data Scientist is a Star whose skills are much in demand. But for machine learning to be a practical success in real world, production settings, there’s a lot beyond the algorithm and model that must be done correctly. 

Is the question or issue being addressed by machine learning appropriate for the specific goal? Can models be evaluated in a meaningful way and deployed and maintained in production with the expertise available? Is there sufficient domain knowledge to make certain the project is addressing the right issues? Is there a way to take practical action on the insights gained through machine-driven decisions?

This presentation will explore real world examples to discover some of the pitfalls to avoid and to show a variety of tips and best practices - from planning to model management and deployment in production -- that can help make your machine learning systems successful.

	                              so thank you all for coming out here                               this talk is really about what makes                               things practical those little things                               that can stand in the way of something                               working like this is the seventh time                               I've been at buzzwords and I actually                               went to the wrong meeting room thinking                               I knew the names of the room and                               wondered why Holden was on the same                                stage where I thought I was giving a                                talk so it's those little practical                                things that can get in the way of                                success if you're not careful we're                                gonna look at how that works with                                machine learning this is not to say that                                the algorithm you pick the way you build                                a model is not absolutely essential to                                success but that's the kind of exciting                                sexy part of it that people tend to                                focus on and sometimes not look at all                                the things that are wrapped around that                                that make a difference for a machine                                learning system a machine learning                                project to really be a success not in                                isolation evaluated one model against                                another but to be a success embedded in                                real-world business situations and so                                that's what we want to look at today                                this is me I'm principal technologist                                with map our technologies based in San                                Jose I'm also committed on a couple of                                Apache projects and I've written several                                short books with O'Reilly this is my                                contact information and I repeat that at                                the end of the talk so what we want to                                look at today are the issues that really                                make a difference for machine learning                                real value in production settings and so                                let's start with the obvious fairly                                specific question you probably all have                                in your mind already and that is what is                                a chicken plus tensorflow have to do a                                success in machine learning okay so we                                should start with something a little bit                                fun but this is a real story as well we                                have a friend and colleague and Downard                                he's a very good data engineer he's a                                software engineer what he is not is a                                data scientist he's never tried machine                                learning before but he got very                                intrigued after he went to a talk by                                some Google evangelists talking about                                tensorflow he was excited about the idea                                of deep learning image recognition and                                he really wanted to give it a try but he                                didn't really have a reason to do it                                other than he wanted to give it a try                                and so he decided he would                                flying at home kind of a weekend project                                apparently he has a henhouse and had                                some problems and that some bird was                                entering the henhouse and pecking the                                eggs before he could get to it so he                                thought he could set up an image                                recognition system that would detect                                this whoever was coming in and pecking                                the eggs and that gave him a way to save                                his eggs and more importantly an excuse                                for getting to play around a little with                                tensorflow                                and that's what he built so he basically                                trained how model to be able to                                recognize these different images he had                                two kinds of chickens in his henhouse                                Rhode Island red something called a Buff                                Orpington conv an odd name and he                                suspected that what was coming in and                                pecking the eggs with a J so he needed                                to train on these three things and this                                is how he basically labeled the                                detection the classification categories                                he was looking for now what kind of                                lessons can we learn from this well                                first of all he's doing image                                recognition but what really matters for                                this project is essentially this it's a                                chicken or it's not a chicken                                that's what mattered to him and most                                importantly in this situation this one                                was potentially a predator and that gets                                to the first lesson you can take from                                this toy project domain knowledge really                                does matter you have to know a little                                not just about the model you have to                                know a little about the system are you                                asking the right question what's going                                to bring you value he had to know to                                know what to train what images to train                                on a forehand to realize that this was                                 actually a Western scrub J and he could                                 get lots of images of scrub jays and                                 that's what he did so this pursuit never                                 done machine learning very successfully                                 built this mom he wrote a nice little                                 blog about it and he did a lot of things                                 right there good lessons in this for                                 even more important projects he gathered                                 a lot of training data he had thousand                                 several thousand images of each type of                                 bird he trained a tensorflow model but                                 he didn't have to build it all from                                 scratch he took advantage of an                                 inception v                                                           already constructed and so someone else                                 had done the heavy lifting that's why he                                 didn't have to have that intense                                 background as a data scientist to be                                 able to build a model                                 so image recognition deep learning is                                 very complicated very sophisticated but                                 fortunately now there are some models                                 where somebody can come in and basically                                 get the images to train a prebuilt model                                 and this is what he did so he had                                 deployed into his in-house he had a way                                 to deploy this in a practical way he had                                 a camera so it motion capture ran a                                 program for that had pre trained on                                 these images he set up his systems that                                 he had a way that he could retrain the                                 model if he needed to he deployed this                                 right at the IOT edge right next to the                                 the IOT sensor data in this case his                                 in-house and his camera he deployed this                                 just a little raspberry pi's this very                                 simple system and he then needed to make                                 this a practical system he needed what                                 he needed some way to report the results                                 to report the results so he had an                                 output that went to a Twitter feed                                 called                                 apt tensor chicken she's got all the                                 pieces there how well did it work how                                 can we tell if it's success well first                                 of all oops I'm going to go back first                                 of all you can look at this tensor I                                 don't know if you can read this tiny                                 print but it's kind of dark but they're                                 two different examples here one of this                                 Rhode Island red in one of this Buff                                 Orpington picture and if you can                                 actually see the results he reported                                 that live results in this feed on on                                 Twitter you can see that the model was                                 correctly classifying these images at                                 very high accuracy could recognize this                                 as being in Rhode Island red it                                 recognized that as being a Buff                                 Orpington I didn't get a picture where                                 he had a J coming in but it was a really                                 efficient system so it looked like a                                 roaring success it certainly was a                                 success that his original intent was to                                 try this and see if he could do it and                                 and have some fun with it and that part                                 worked great so it was working really                                 really well it's an efficient model but                                 here are some other questions he could                                 ask I was talking to him and I said                                 because he was to actually trying to                                 stop something from pecking eggs I said                                 how long does it take for that image                                 recognition for that classification to                                 happen it's just running a raspberry pi                                 is said about                                                      classify an image so how does it take                                 for a blue jay to peck an egg                                 well the answer is less than                                            so do we see a problem with this now as                                 you think about this in a practical way                                 he has basically a requirement in SLA to                                 have some response faster than this bird                                 is going to peck an egg this isn't going                                 to work now I was just asking him for                                 fun                                 turns out I think he got inspired he                                 works for map our mapper has a wonderful                                 system where you can build or deploy a                                 really small footprint map or cluster                                 right at the the edge so you can do edge                                 computing for IOT data and so he was                                 going to put that in his hen house I                                 don't know if he ever actually did that                                 but he had figured he could get this                                 down to a response time that was so fast                                 it was ridiculous by doing it that way                                 is he said a bit of over engineering for                                 a simple project there's actually a                                 lesson than that too for a lot of things                                 you do need something to be fast enough                                 to meet your practical requirement but                                 faster all by itself is not better if                                 it's fast enough and then you spend time                                 trying to make a model run faster and                                 faster that's kind of wasted effort so                                 again be very aware what the actual                                 requirements are what fits what you need                                 to do to be able to get value if you're                                 doing this in a practical way there was                                 a separate issue I said what are you                                 gonna do if you get it running fast                                 enough and you can actually detect that                                 a predator has come in how are you going                                 to scare it away hmm they haven't quite                                 figured that part out yet we had a                                 little fun thinking of various horrible                                 things you could do to scare a bird away                                 unfortunately most most of those would                                 also make your hands not lay eggs what's                                 basically been the outcome of this is                                 that ian has gone on he's changed the                                 tensor chicken-out output on Twitter I                                 see he's now trying to identify                                 different types of hummingbirds and                                 hummingbird feeders were fun he's gone                                 on with it but there really are in this                                 to a example some important lessons that                                 apply for real-world situations by the                                 way I mentioned earlier that domain                                 knowledge matters and it does you need                                 to know a lot about the the subject                                 matter somewhere in the middle of the                                 night when I was writing this up for a                                 reporter or chapter in a book because                                 I've thought this as a fun story I                                 started thinking about the fact that the                                 name                                 Orpington Orpingtons a weird name but                                 it's I think someplace in England but                                 buff in English generally means a light                                 tan kind of even golden color so this                                 pretty little black chicken with white                                 spots didn't sound like buff in anything                                 and I got curious and you can waste a                                 lot of time when you have a chapter due                                 and you should be doing something else                                 so I started looking for images of                                 chickens on Google and I discovered that                                 what a Buff Orpington chicken looks like                                 actually is this somebody had sold him                                 eggs they told him what kinds of                                 chickens they were turns out that wasn't                                 true and so I contacted an I thought it                                 was hilarious and said I think you have                                 a different kind of chicken it turned                                 out to be called a Plymouth Rock the                                 chicken that he had well it turns out he                                 actually went back and retrained his                                 model because he wanted to see if he                                 could get it to work and it's wonderful                                 you could watch in the evaluation of the                                 bottles as one changes and the other                                 comes up again a good lesson in a toy a                                 toy project but there's also a lesson                                 here he was embarrassed he had his                                 chicken labeled wrong but for the                                 purposes of that project if you think                                 about it as being trying to identify a                                 predator again this becomes over                                 engineering you don't need if it's wrong                                 and that's too bad but all that mattered                                 is that you can say it's a chicken and                                 it's not the predator so it actually                                 didn't matter that he had it named wrong                                 in terms of how the project was supposed                                 to work so these are some of the serious                                 lessons that come out of this incredibly                                 simple project one I haven't mentioned                                 and I think maybe it's the most                                 important one is that there is a very                                 important role for data engineering in                                 machine learning systems and I think                                 people are really increasingly                                 recognizing that for these systems to                                 work in a real-world situation to                                 actually be deployed in a sustainable                                 and reasonable way into production it's                                 absolutely important that you're able to                                 handle the logistics of gathering data                                 training getting the training data for a                                 model adjusting data that's input data                                 later as the model is deployed into                                 production how do you keep all of this                                 system running how do you manage the                                 models there                                 water places where the characteristics                                 that the the skills that a person has as                                 a software engineer add to that some                                 data skills and this becomes a very                                 powerful profession right now to be a                                 data engineer and so there's a real role                                 for that in this case it's a little                                 unusual because ian was doing this                                 project on his own because of that                                 convenience of a pre-made model the                                 inception v                                                           could just customize and there's a hint                                 to in some cases the simple model                                 actually works very well if it fits what                                 you're trying to do in a situation and                                 sometimes a data engineer can do this                                 and you don't always need a PhD level                                 data scientist for all of this but even                                 projects they're very complicated where                                 you really need a serious data science                                 team there's a huge role for the data                                 engineer but the part that I signed this                                 that I found the most interesting is                                 that for these things to work in the                                 real world you need the data engineers                                 to be excited about doing this work and                                 was really fired up about this I mean he                                 spent some time he got this going on his                                 own it's exciting to him to see how                                 these projects work and to be an                                 integral part of it and that carries                                 over to real-world situation so before                                 we go forward I have a few questions for                                 you the audience how many people in here                                 are working now or have recently worked                                 on machine learning projects can we see                                 a show of hands just about everybody how                                 many people in here would call                                 themselves data scientists some of you                                 not all of you how many see them                                 yourselves more as an engineer has a                                 data engineer for in that role so again                                 a mix how many people came because                                 they're interested in chickens no okay                                 just a second all right so as you can                                 see there's a mix even in this audience                                 and I think that really is the formula                                 for success as we see that those roles                                 need to work together the data engineer                                 takes a lot of the pressure off of the                                 data scientist to make sure that these                                 aspects of a project are done correctly                                 the data scientist is supplying that                                 expertise for the model and the                                 algorithm itself those things need to                                 work together so let's look at some real                                 world examples and the first one is also                                 an example where                                 it's nothing only importance about it                                 but it's also an example where the                                 domain knowledge matters this is a                                 situation where a person had built a                                 video recommendation system the person                                 doing this was the data scientist knew a                                 lot about algorithm central so forth                                 but it actually does matter to be aware                                 of how are you posing your question are                                 you using the right data you're trying                                 to see the preferences of people                                 watching these videos and so if you say                                 is a model success you're evaluating                                 that model is a model successful does it                                 perform well then you say is it actually                                 able to identify preferences and and say                                 these are the outstanding things and it                                 did very very well except in the end it                                 wasn't a good recommender in terms of                                 the audience because it was originally                                 trained on using clicks on these videos                                 and if you think about it what clicks on                                 videos tell you is it tells you how well                                 people like the title of the video                                 that's what captures their attention if                                 you want a better recommender you have                                 to actually look at the first few                                 seconds of a viewing in this case                                    seconds turned out to be a good number                                 and now you're actually being able to                                 gauge that behavior is now telling you                                 something about the person's preference                                 for the video as opposed to whether                                 there's catchy title so it's not a                                 change in the algorithm it's a change in                                 making the right choice about that input                                 data this was a real business it made a                                 tremendous amount of difference for the                                 business to make that small adjustment                                 so these things really do matter                                 another example that comes from a real                                 world situation is a person who is an                                 expert in security for financial                                 institutions and in one situation he had                                 been saving all of the the headers for                                 website interactions and saving more                                 detail than you think that you might                                 want and it wasn't because he was                                 looking for any specific thing he just                                 wanted the best possible records of what                                 normal behavior looks like what normal                                 behavior looks like interacting with                                 this website now why was he interested                                 in normal behavior because of course he                                 wanted to be able to                                 abnormal behavior he wanted to see those                                 outliers as they happen and that's                                 exactly what happened here so the lesson                                 here to look for is this person is                                 actually very sophisticated in his                                 ability to do this I think I'm allowed                                 to he works for map R now we've known                                 him for years he was actually one of the                                 people who helped track down what                                 happened in these believe it's called                                 ababeel attacks several years ago which                                 were very serious large-scale attacks by                                 a foreign entity so this is somebody                                 with a lot of experience and very                                 sophisticated in this field but it turns                                 out in this situation what actually                                 mattered is something in itself that's                                 incredibly simple and it is simply                                 noticing the difference in the ordering                                 of these elements in these headers now                                 the normal situation on their right here                                 the real request differs from the                                 attacker request but this difference                                 this behavior is not something in itself                                 that would interfere with function it's                                 not something even a sophisticated                                 person could predict it's not something                                 you can look for okay                                 you wouldn't know which piece of this to                                 look for but the point is simply that                                 it's different it shows up not as normal                                 behavior because it isn't normal                                 behavior it's about doing something is                                 not a human and this makes a big                                 difference and another example in this                                 case the attacker request now on the                                 other side is a difference in whether                                 you start these lines with a capital                                 letter or small letter why I'm showing                                 you these examples are these are                                 situations where again having some                                 domain understanding it's not so much a                                 sophistication this is fairly simple                                 modeling to do that you have to know                                 what to look for or have systems that                                 are ready to look for things the other                                 lesson here is that you have to be able                                 to preserve data even in some cases                                 where you don't know exactly how it will                                 be needed later and what aspects of that                                 data are important in one situation may                                 be the parts you would have thrown away                                 so raw data is really very valuable for                                 machine learning obviously it's going to                                 be processed                                 gonna add various things to it as you                                 develop data for training as you develop                                 input data for model but if you can                                 preserve raw data you can't preserve                                 everything but to whatever extent you                                 can preserve raw data that gives you                                 some really powerful options in the                                 future as you start to do new new                                 projects new systems or even within the                                 system you're working on as you realize                                 something that you might have thrown                                 away as a feature actually matters and                                 fortunately really good really efficient                                 modern distributed systems make it                                 possible to do that to store that data                                 and get access to it and for people to                                 do it really in in even large companies                                 that are distributed across different                                 locations you don't always know what                                 you're going to need and yet it's pretty                                 easy to get access to that kind of                                 comprehensive view of data when you need                                 it now that's different from trying to                                 preserve data that's the actual data are                                 using for training a model and we'll                                 talk about that a little later that has                                 another practical value let's switch to                                 one more real-world system there's a lot                                 of machine learning being done and areas                                 where big industrial systems certainly                                 where IOT data is being produced some of                                 the examples I've given you so far as to                                 say that what can make a machine                                 learning project successful and very                                 valuable is actually the knowledge that                                 you put into it are you asking the right                                 question sometimes the model itself is                                 fairly simple not that hard to build can                                 you deploy it in the right way those can                                 have huge impact but certainly there are                                 these other systems where that model is                                 very very complicated one of the                                 examples that gets the most attention                                 lately or people working with autonomous                                 cars those are not simple kind of                                 decision processes for a machine                                 learning model in those cases you're not                                 looking for just a right answer let's                                 take the example you're driving up the                                 road your system comes back and tells                                 your car make a right turn at this                                 intersection now if you have a                                 navigation system and that's a                                 reasonable route to where you're going                                 saying TURN RIGHT might be the right                                 answer if there happens to be a bus                                 or a pothole or a small child standing                                 in the way turning right at that moment                                 is very much not the right answer those                                 are systems that are complicated they                                 have to process data very effectively                                 process it in real time it's an                                 interactive system where basically                                 you're constantly getting data adjusting                                 the the choices and the insights those                                 are very complicated systems they're                                 very very valuable and there are a                                 number of different areas where you see                                 modeling like that being done certainly                                 in transportation throughout the medical                                 industry people are also beginning to                                 use machine learning AI in situations in                                 medical research in other situations                                 that are therapeutic where we're                                 assisting human driven decisions by                                 initial analysis of images for example                                 not something simple like chickens and                                 Blue Jays but much more complicated                                 images where you're assisting histology                                 and so forth scannings                                 MRIs and and being able to supply that                                 data back to the doctor so that she or                                 he can more easily make a decision in a                                 decision about the patient so there's                                 some very very complicated examples                                 especially in this world and especially                                 in the world of large scale industry and                                 machinery manufacturing is changing                                 completely right now it's making itself                                 into something new an example that I've                                 seen recently is up in northern England                                 UK has set up a research center called                                 the advanced manufacturing research                                 center or a MRC and they're doing a lot                                 of research where they're actually                                 taking in production systems with a                                 hundred or                                                           Boeing is the one that's been the most                                 prominent so their name is attached with                                 it and they're putting that in direct                                 contact with the the latest sort of                                 state-of-the-art engineering knowledge                                 from the University and these are                                 systems where the engineers are                                 literally sitting right on the floor of                                 a reconfigurable factory called a                                 factory                                                                where at every level of the process from                                 planning actual production coming in                                 testing a lot of                                 for automotive a lot of it is for things                                 in the aerospace industry there are                                 other examples as well but these are                                 being put you know a very short pipeline                                 between research and new ideas                                 innovation directly into what's                                 happening in in these companies and                                 they're training up people who are able                                 to work with basically smart tools I                                 mean you have all these sophisticated                                 ideas coming out and somebody's going to                                 work on the assembly line who's actually                                 going to be able to do that so these                                 systems are changing very fast certainly                                 there's practical value in that now                                 having said that I'm going to turn                                 around and show you a system that's just                                 the obvious opposite it's in the same                                 industry or in the same arena all of                                 these situations whether you have a                                 telecommunications company you have                                 manufacturing you have large-scale                                 transportation you have people in the                                 oil and gas industry and all of these                                 situations very sophisticated businesses                                 but they're businesses and they have all                                 the basic challenges and issues of basic                                 business processes after track what's                                 going on with the business they need to                                 track metrics of what's working or not                                 if they're also customer facing they                                 need to track aspects of their impact                                 customer relations customer services                                 what happens with marketing and what do                                 all of these companies have in common                                 is billing and revenue and that makes a                                 big difference so we're talking about                                 practical situations that have can have                                 huge impact in huge value and it turns                                 out one of the greatest skills that a                                 data scientist can have is not just that                                 sophistication of the algorithm in the                                 model but it's the ability to look at                                 these businesses to recognize those                                 places where using machine learning can                                 optimize or automate a step and if that                                 step can have tremendous impact actual                                 value to the system to the company                                 that's a really ripe place for machine                                 learning and so again they're not the                                 examples that I think get written up                                 right now with all these very                                 sophisticated AI systems they can be                                 very simple or they could be                                 sophisticated but they can make a                                 tremendous difference so in one                                 particular case this is a large industry                                 I can't say which one but it happens to                                 be a manpower customer but they have to                                 deal with a tremendous amount of                                 machinery and they're looking they're                                 having to track and label various                                 actions that were taken supplies repairs                                 that were done deliverables out to other                                 customers they also have to track parts                                 and equipment that are brought in and                                 parts that are being moved into                                 different parts of the company so all of                                 this has to be tracked it's not the                                 exciting part of this business but it's                                 very important and it gets each item                                 each system each action gets labeled now                                 what happens if those labels are applied                                 incorrectly or somebody gets in a hurry                                 and they just put miscellaneous on a                                 label well I can have a tremendous                                 impact because the way these different                                 actions and parts are labeled is                                 actually determines whether they're                                 taxed it determines whether they can be                                 written back against expenses basically                                 it's something that determines whether                                 they're billable out to another another                                 client is a part of their revenue stream                                 this is the tremendous difference to the                                 business and yet it's a very simple step                                 it's being done all over the business by                                 a lot of people and often these pieces                                 are mislabeled and so we had a data                                 scientist who came in talked to people                                 there figured out that that simple step                                 of mislabelling sometimes mislabeling or                                 just generically labeling things as                                 miscellaneous was causing this company                                 to miss out on the opportunity of saving                                 or collecting tens of millions of                                 dollars and so he set up an automated                                 system not to change the labels but                                 basically a detection system to look for                                 patterns that would alert people in an                                 audit to classes of these labels that                                 look potentially like they might be                                 mislabeled so that reduces the auditing                                 to focus into                                 get in on the things that are gonna make                                 a difference so this was done it was                                 done fairly quickly and through that                                 simple step of recognizing those steps                                 within a business where a decision                                 process where there's a bottleneck where                                 there's an error something that                                 automating could make that worthwhile                                 literally was worth tens of millions of                                 dollars for this company and the                                 specifics have to do with that company                                 but that pattern that situation you                                 would find in a lot of different                                 companies and so if you're really                                 looking at how to make machine learning                                 valuable how to make a system a success                                 again it isn't always about the                                 algorithm itself but it's about what you                                 build around it does it fit into the                                 business is your is your successful                                 model running like an engine that's out                                 of gear is it connected into a real                                 action that you can take now let's take                                 that last thought of is it connected to                                 a real action you can take let's jump                                 back to the idea of our friend with the                                 henhouse and the image recognition we                                 said he hadn't thought through what                                 action would you take to be able to                                 scare away a blue jay that was the                                 missing action he had an action that                                 some people say oh my machine learning                                 system is set up to have an actionable                                 step at the end but what they're seeing                                 is an actionable step is a report I mean                                 in his case it was reporting the stuff                                 to tensor chicken a report is not it's                                 good you need to track what's happening                                 but just reporting what's going on isn't                                 really an actionable step it doesn't                                 connect you to things that will bring                                 that real business value I see somebody                                 nodding I suspect you have run into this                                 in the real world jumping back to this                                 example that happened with the                                 large-scale industry what was another                                 thing that was cool about that example                                 is not just that they detected that                                 there could be errors but it was set in                                 a way that was practical for their flow                                 of business so that they could have you                                 know basically human audits that could                                 then go in and and take an action take a                                 change and save their money so it is                                 really the responsibility of people on                                 the the data science team the data                                 engineering data scientists together                                 either they need to see where those                                 actions can be taken or they need to be                                 able to communicate with people within                                 the business who are the ones who have                                 will be able to take the action or                                 identify it for them you need to work                                 together and identify that and if you                                 don't do that really what you're doing                                 is kind of a fun weekend project it                                 might be a little bigger than a weekend                                 project if it's for a business but it's                                 not going to bring those practical                                 results now making a shift I've been                                 saying that one of the things that                                 matters the most for machine learning to                                 work is not just the algorithm or the                                 model itself but it's the logistics the                                 data managing models all of that                                 together and connected into real                                 business action when you talk to people                                 about what's the most important machine                                 learning tool we find that people use a                                 lot of different tools it's not to say                                 they're all equal but most people doing                                 this successfully have four or five or                                 six different machine learning tools to                                 actually build algorithm that they like                                 another little I'm curious about the                                 audience always your experience so I'll                                 just say is anybody in here used h                                      I'm surprised no one I recommend that to                                 people it's it's a great system for                                 really good for deep learning for other                                 things as well it makes net tensorflow                                 cafe its show of hands there there are a                                 lot of different tools and new ones will                                 keep coming most people hat keep a kind                                 of a toolkit or several tools but in                                 some ways the single tool that matters                                 the most because it supports all of                                 those and it supports that next machine                                 learning specific tool that you're going                                 to add you know next year that you don't                                 know about yet is to have the platform                                 capabilities that actually handle the                                 logistics and handle them in an                                 efficient and consistent way especially                                 in a large business across different                                 systems because you don't want to have                                 to build all of these from scratch for                                 every system and that again are the                                 places where you can actually bring this                                 kind of practical success it makes a big                                 difference so in some ways it's really                                 the logistics that make the biggest                                 difference from machine learning to work                                 now with that in mind this isn't the                                 only way to                                 do it but I want to throw a thought out                                 there plant a thought is streaming is an                                 incredibly powerful way to build an                                 architecture streaming matters because                                 it supports micro-services I think I                                 misread that little time signal so I'm                                 going to speed up here I was slowing                                 down because I thought it was incredibly                                 slow streaming is at the heart of can be                                 at the heart of an architecture it's not                                 just for real-time applications and what                                 really matters is the stream transport                                 system if you want to do micro services                                 you need a stream transport system in                                 the style of Kafka Apache Kafka example                                 now for streams is an example where                                 you're not broadcasting the results to a                                 group of consumers but they're actually                                 subscribing it and it's at decoupling                                 between producers and consumers and                                 between consumers and each other                                 that really matter the message is there                                 it's ready to be consumed immediately                                 that's good for real-time it doesn't                                 have to be used right away the consumer                                 doesn't have to be online and that's                                 what gives you that kind of independence                                 that really is at the heart of micro                                 services so you can use streams as the                                 lightweight connectors between micro                                 services so holding that idea in mind                                 also want to remind you that I think                                 most people in here do machine learning                                 so this is not news but people think                                 that you know in machine learning                                 involves building the model obviously                                 involves building a lot of models often                                 hundreds of models and you have to have                                 some way to handle it the management the                                 deployment of those models the                                 evaluation and also the data that you're                                 using and so really the logistics can be                                 very challenging you're using data from                                 many different data sources obviously a                                 big scale you have a lot of different                                 models that you need to be able to                                 handle you want to be able to evaluate                                 them model to model in an effective way                                 but a good style is to also be able to                                 have a number of good enough models                                 they're already up and running they're                                 basically waiting in the wings and when                                 you want to deploy them into production                                 you can roll it out and indeed roll it                                 back if you need to essentially a system                                 where all you have to do to deploy a new                                 model is not to fire it up but simply to                                 stop ignoring it you've been saying wait                                 wait wait now you                                 say go and this gives you tremendous                                 flexibility now there's more than one                                 way to do that but one of the systems                                 that we've talked about is what's called                                 a rendezvous architecture Ted Dunning                                 who's here in the front row and I wrote                                 a short book about this last year called                                 machine learning logistics and we talked                                 about this system which is based on the                                 idea of streaming micro services we're                                 actually using streams not only to have                                 those advantages of handling data or                                 adding you know whatever you need to raw                                 data to really build input data for for                                 models but you're looking at a whole                                 system of models you build a rendezvous                                 server and that server is constantly                                 making decisions it's seeing the input                                 it's looking at the output scores from                                 all of the different models and requests                                 by request it's basically making a                                 decision of what is the best choice in                                 that moment for that single request                                 what's the best system to fit a set of                                 basically pre-configured SLA is you've                                 determined what constitutes the right                                 choices for that moment and it's                                 constantly making that decision so it                                 can roll one model in one model back                                 gives you that enormous amount of                                 flexibility so it's really looking at                                 the scores looking at the request by                                 request looking at all these different                                 models and making that decision that's                                 what's at the heart of this rendezvous                                 approach as I said we wrote about it in                                 this book I'll give you that contact                                 information at the end one of the things                                 to point out about this system is that                                 it is very important to be able to                                 identify input model data for a model                                 exactly so we recommend running a decoy                                 model this is looks like a real model it                                 takes the input data it doesn't do                                 anything with it it just archives in                                 that might not be a good idea if you                                 didn't have complete Independence of the                                 microservices but in this kind of system                                 you do that gives you a very valuable                                 record of what was used as input data                                 that combined with me able to deploy                                 models into containers you have a way to                                 to test and retest things evaluate them                                 in very predictable and reproducible                                 systems                                 another aspect of the rendezvous system                                 is to have what's called a canary model                                 and so the canary model ISM                                 godless deployed into production it's                                 doing well it gives you a kind of                                 baseline for what is reasonable adequate                                 performance if you roll a new model out                                 you can actually quickly do a comparison                                 of the performance of that canary model                                 and a new model and that difference you                                 want things to be better but if it's two                                 different you know that's a flag that                                 maybe there's something wrong so it                                 gives you a kind of a stabilizer on                                 production systems to make sure                                 everything's going pretty well                                 so rendezvous says this architecture is                                 a really good way to handle machine                                 learning logistics for simple systems                                 that are basically decisioning where you                                 have a yes/no sort of animal yes/no but                                 you're looking for a specific answer not                                 these kind of complex interactive                                 systems such as an autonomous car this                                 has also been talked about we wrote an                                 entry in the encyclopedia of Big Data                                 technologies recently and rendezvous

                   and logistics that way that one comes                                 out of data bricks clipper is coming                                 from the rise lab at the University of                                 California Berkeley this is a really                                 interesting system some of the goals and                                 some of the aspects of that design or                                 are similar to some of the ways the                                 issues that the rendezvous architecture                                 are trying to attack things will change                                 oh I just want to remind you I think                                 there's a slider I missed a slide here                                 since Ted talked about rendezvous here                                 at buzzwords a year ago was very news                                 before we written the book since then                                 several people have implemented this                                 some large companies are in the process                                 of building the server and so it is                                 something that's happening and there                                 been some questions about larger                                 projects going together and trying to                                 build these so if you have any interest                                 in working on a project to build a                                 rendezvous server please contact me or                                 contact Ted the last issue here I just                                 want to mention is when you're working                                 in systems where you need Fleck                                 ability you know you want to be able to                                 respond to we don't say if conditions                                 change you know they will change that's                                 one reason you want a system like                                 rendezvous that can role models out                                 easily roll them back no matter how good                                 a model is and how well it fits a                                 situation the outside world will change                                 but in addition to the flexibility in                                 terms of the design of your dataflow                                 workflow the design of the technologies                                 that you're using if you have a really                                 rigid structure in terms of the human                                 interactions that's can still be a                                 barrier to success and so I'm talking                                 more and more to people who are taking                                 an approach of using a style we're                                 calling Dave they're calling data ops                                 it's extending the DevOps approach but                                 including these data heavy roles like                                 data science and data engineering I                                 think to a lot of people that sounds                                 like fluffy buzzword marketing stuff but                                 we've talked to some people who are                                 they're consulting companies are almost                                 entirely focused on taking big data                                 systems into production and one person I                                 asked recently really surprised me                                 I said what's a single biggest barrier                                 to people being successful in production                                 and he said they need to have a data                                 office approached it's absolutely not                                 what I thought he would pick us the                                 that's a central theme this house real                                  power despite all the buzzy things                                  they're being said about it and it's as                                  simple as the fact that you need people                                  across these different skills you need                                  to breakthrough skill gills you need for                                  people to feel that they're part of the                                  same project they're focused on the same                                  goals and that way somebody with one set                                  of skills somebody with another set of                                  skills a data scientist a data engineer                                  if they ask for help from each other                                  it's not like they're doing a favor                                  they've imposed on you know whatever is                                  a normal workflow for that person is                                  they are part of the same system and                                  that change that focus on a shared goal                                  can make a tremendous difference in the                                  time to value the efficiency of how                                  people work and you can capture some of                                  that excitement that our friend iam                                  Downard had as a data engineer when he                                  found he was part of a machine learning                                  project so that's the most important                                  important part of my message today and                                  I'll remind you you'll have                                  slides at the end we have this book we                                  had an earlier book where we talked                                  about streaming architecture which is                                  the basis for this kind of architecture                                  I wrote a book on Apache flink with                                  Costa sumus from data artisans I'm a big                                  fan of flink so if you want to do some                                  fast processing that's a great way to do                                  it please help support women in                                  technology it's really good not just for                                  women but it's good for society and this                                  is from
