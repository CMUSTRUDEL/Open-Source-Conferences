Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2018: Aurélie Pols – Technical Consequences of the Data Subject's Rights #bbuzz
Publication date: 2018-06-13
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2018 #bbuzz
Description: 
	In her keynote speech Aurélie will focus on data subject's rights and the technical consequences of these obligations. As the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will be enforced as of May 25th 2018 and replace the current Data Protection Directive, data subject’s rights are being re-introduced and reinforced, building the ground work for a more balanced approach towards data uses within our increasingly digitized societies. 

Aurélie will dive into the practical perspective of how to manage these new GDPR data subject rights, what it means for your processes and IT systems and when or to what type of data they apply.

	                              thank you very much and thank you for                               having me it's it's good to be back in                               Berlin with such nice weather as well                               yesterday over beers when we were                               enjoying the barbecue somebody said you                               don't like Google very much it was like                               well I actually asked questions and I                               think questions are important for us to                               understand how we use the technology and                                in that sense I actually stole a slide                                from somebody from Autodesk called                                product who's based in San Francisco and                                she we both come out of the digital                                analytics industry so I started with                                Google and now it takes a long time ago                                and she had this very nice slide about                                hunting down vendors and trying to                                understand what they're up to to make                                sure that you're compliant with the gdpr                                so I like the nice cats basically this                                is also what I do and why I usually wear                                pink because I'm a nice person who just                                asks questions to make sure that we're                                all accountable because it's one of the                                principles of the GDP our article                                    where basically we should go towards                                this idea of responsible uses of                                information moving beyond just managing                                data I think this is important to                                understand and through my entire career                                I've used data I love data I'm terrible                                at coding I found that out very early on                                when I did basic coding at school maybe                                my teacher was just bad but basically I                                like data but I'm also worried about                                what data brings because of the history                                of my family and because most of the                                time I'm also an outlier I do things                                differently I live in Spain I speak                                French I'm Dutch and work in English so                                when we talk for example about                                differential privacy or ways to                                anonymize data                                well that outlier is typically me or my                                family so this is actually why I care so                                much about data but also about making                                sure this is balanced                                with the the European project a couple                                of days ago or last week I was in in                                London for the strata conference where I                                talked for about three and a half hours                                about the GTR so I talked to engineers                                like yourselves data scientists about                                the law and I talked to lawyers about                                technology and usually both of you                                freaked out at some point which is fine                                we just need to have conversations but                                it was interesting to see at strata this                                banner talking about the problem solving                                problems with data and a week before                                that I was in Brussels talking about                                ethics and somebody from the                                accountability foundation was talking                                about the fact that he wanted a car that                                could predict when he would have an                                accident because that person is over                                   years old and well he's getting                                dangerous on the roads and I was sitting                                next to the folks of the commission of                                ethics and we looked at each other and                                we were like driver's license in the                                United States how does that work again                                did that guy on the road is that a good                                idea actually even if he has a great                                great car and before that I was talking                                also to Sheila of axiom I like axiom                                more than Google but I have to confess                                and she was also talking about certain                                problems that were being solved through                                data and it struck me because these                                problems are not similar to mine and so                                a question that I was wondering is                                whether our values actually influence                                the problems were trying to solve and in                                that sense certain problems that certain                                entities are trying to solve are maybe                                not the same problems that we have and                                this is also where I think the gdpr is                                the start of a journey where basically                                we need to think about what we do with                                the data and also the consequence on the                                data and there's an interesting story as                                I said I'm Dutch                                an interesting story in the Netherlands                                where many years ago they wanted to make                                sure that people were buried according                                to their religious rights and so what                                they did is that they created lists of                                people and their religion what happened                                 next was world war ii and the invasions                                 of the germans so the lists were useful                                 so be careful what you do with the data                                 and as i heard yesterday about ranting                                 about data retention periods there's a                                 reason why we shouldn't hold on to data                                 for too long and there's a reason why we                                 have principles related to how we use                                 data in the best possible ways to solve                                 problems what we're facing today is are                                 many questions our societies are                                 changing one way or another and i                                 usually compare european law to the                                 Sagrada família so I don't know if you                                 guys have been to Barcelona but it's a                                 cathedral by Gaudi that has been                                 building up for many many years and                                 European legislation is a bit like that                                 as well as it's based on common law                                 legislation which is not the same thing                                 sorry it's Basel civil law legislation                                 which is not the same thing as common                                 law in the United States so from the                                 beginning the way we build legislation                                 in different continents is not the same                                 as such the United States and                                 anglo-saxon countries are outliers as                                 they had give more power to the courts                                 and jurisprudence which is not same                                 thing as our construction of the                                 European values which can be compared to                                 the Sagrada família and today we will                                 have to solve for many different                                 problems in that sense the GD P R is                                 basically a starting point this is a                                 history of where the GD P R comes from                                 in case you thought it kind of fell out                                 of the sky it started after world war                                 two so if there is maybe something or                                 movie you want to see to understand the                                 fundamentals                                 ge PR legislation there's a Netflix                                 series called the Tokyo trials which                                 tries to understand how to judge war                                 criminals after World War one knowing                                 also that they need to align with                                 Nuremberg trials in that sense this                                 Cathedral we're trying to build needs to                                 be aligned with what we've done in the                                 past and a lot of people always compare                                 technology to legal but what I've seen                                 is in the past and certainly for                                 companies that have been there for a                                 couple of years they have challenges                                 related to the GDP are an obligation                                 certainly related to data subject rights                                 because of the way they built their                                 infrastructure so while technology is                                 about legal so is the law and actually                                 the law is a much more powerful legal                                 box tool than technology is but where we                                 need to make sure that it aligns with                                 the history that we've built and this is                                 what basically a lot of technology                                 companies are facing today is I bet my                                 infrastructure in this way hence I                                 cannot be compliant with the GD P R and                                 this is where a lot of legal experts                                 also say it's not because your                                 technology doesn't allow you to be                                 compliant that it makes it compliant so                                 history plays a important role and in                                 that sense this is where it all started                                 this idea of human rights the                                 Declaration of Human Rights that was                                 published by Eleanor Roosevelt in                                      which is also why we created the United                                 Nations and you can say well it's not                                 very useful and who cares and there's                                 boats of refugees in Italy that nobody                                 wants but we are trying to build our                                 societies according to certain values                                 and in that sense we all have a role to                                 play as employees of technology                                 companies as data subjects as parents                                 but everybody has to role to play inside                                 here to make sure that we allow                                 with that this is what the GTR is trying                                 to do the G declares basically makes                                 between the digital single markets we                                 want to build hopefully                                              maybe                                                                 but balanced with the evolution of this                                 Declaration of Human Rights which is the                                 Charter of Fundamental Rights of the                                 European Union so as a technician                                 I wouldn't recommend you read to GDP or                                                                                                      much to digest to be honest but the                                 Charter read the Charter of Fundamental                                 Rights keep that in mind when you're                                 building when you're processing data                                 collecting data these are the values                                 that we want to protect moving forward                                 it's not just Europe it is a global                                 movement the United Nations recognized                                 the right to digital privacy a couple of                                 years back and now we're talking about                                 supervisory authorities on a global                                 level so it's not just Europe it's                                 really a global movement as we digitize                                 our societies in that sense as I said                                 it's like a cathedral we built on top of                                 things through history in that sense                                 that GDP are basically addresses article                                                                                                       might have heard about as well addresses                                 article                                                              we're trying to protect is human dignity                                 this idea that you should be allowed to                                 choose your life and to be yourself                                 which is also recognized by movements                                 like the and Frank foundation where they                                 go around the world explaining what                                 happened during World War two so I have                                 here a slide to back compares GDP are to                                 say whether it's good or bad for                                 technology I'll let you read it at some                                 point but technology is obviously                                 transformed                                 our societies and in that sense                                 legislation like the GD P R is actually                                 important there are things that were                                 seeing involved when it comes to new                                 incumbents within our societies that are                                 not ideal so I live in Madrid I have                                 friends in Barcelona they don't like                                 Airbnb Airbnb is changing the way that                                 their neighborhoods are functioning and                                 I'm seeing it where my mother-in-law                                 lives people with suitcases moving                                 around a lot of noise and the fruit shop                                 kind of disappears you can't live in                                 certain neighborhoods anymore so it's                                 not just about solving problems for your                                 company it's about how society is                                 changing overall and the thing is also                                 there's not the same way of thinking                                 about it between Europe and the United                                 States as I mentioned before this idea                                 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights for                                 us privacy data privacy is about rights                                 the United States talks about the data                                 market which is where for example the                                 French don't like this idea that I am my                                 data my data is part of me it reflects                                 part of me but it's not something that                                 can be sold or shared one way or another                                 and we need to find ways to work better                                 in order to make sure that our values                                 are supported through time so this is                                 also what the GD P R says basically in                                 rest'll                                                                processing personal data should be                                 designed to serve mankind it also                                 continues by saying that it's not an                                 absolute right and this is something you                                 probably see a couple of times through                                 your work where one may be legal counsel                                 will say you have to delete the data and                                 your compliance officer will say oh no                                 no no we work in this kind of sector and                                 we need to keep it so you have to                                 balance these different obligations and                                 rights it's not about not allowing                                 people to use their data it's about                                 making sure that we                                 all accountable for what we actually do                                 so the reason why we talk about the gdpr                                 is obviously the fines if they're fines                                 weren't there if that stick wasn't there                                 we wouldn't follow the carrot so this is                                 why we obviously talk about this this is                                 a representation of all the articles and                                 how they're interlink so as I said I                                 won't tell you that it's easy but it's                                 certainly interesting to understand and                                 if you understand the Charter I think                                 we're going in in a good direction what                                 does the gdpr do basically what the GTR                                 tries to do is to reintroduce those                                 rights within the data ecosystem so it's                                 obviously about companies being                                 compliance laws being pushed by                                 governments                                 it's about industry organizations trying                                 to defy standards and this is only                                 starting we're not there yet                                 but it's certainly about data subjects                                 citizens you me my mother-in-law your                                 grandmother's and everybody that is                                 around you sharing data more and more                                 because our societies are being                                 digitalized and the gdpr didn't happen                                 in the vacuum so obviously we talked                                 about this because of the fines but                                 we're also seeing that the systems are                                 getting more and more complex if I try                                 to define data flows of my mobile phone                                 between my ISP my OS the apps that I                                 have on this it's not easy at all so our                                 systems are becoming more complex we                                 need to become more accountable for how                                 we push data from different systems and                                 how we actually use it and this is also                                 a challenge for supervisory authorities                                 because when you read the law they talk                                 about controllers and processors and                                 maybe joins controllers reality is a lot                                 more complex so communication with                                 supervisory authorities about what you                                 do making sure you're on the right way                                 is important today to assure this our                                 accountability                                 and because moving forward this is not                                 just about your company this is about                                 the societies we're going to build with                                 Internet of Things machine to machine                                 data transfers and in the end data is                                 going to be make decisions about our                                 lives this is a picture of customer                                 service that I saw at San Francisco                                 Airport about                                                          what I think about customer service                                 there's nobody there                                 so every time you call a call center                                 it's about now one for this and I'll                                 true for that my issues are usually                                 rather complicated I prefer to talk to a                                 person so we have come to a point where                                 technology can do a lot of things but                                 now it's time to start balancing the                                 uses of it and making sure it aligns                                 with our values the other picture is an                                 example of what's for example going on                                 in the United States you might have                                 heard about this algorithms that define                                 how long the sentence of people will be                                 you are in front of the courts within                                 European legislation that would never                                 exist because you have a right to                                 understand what the input is of                                 algorithms what the outputs are                                 certainly if they influenced your lives                                 and while we talk often about credit                                 scoring for example knowing how much                                 time you're going to spend in jail                                 certainly does influence your life so                                 it's interesting to see how these                                 debates certainly between the United                                 States and Europe but also looking more                                 towards Asian countries are going to                                 evolve to try to maybe solve this or get                                 better at making sure we build the                                 societies that we actually want                                 something that is also coming out more                                 and more is that we build models and we                                 build systems                                 algorithms that kind of spit out a                                 solution at point at one point in time                                 data changes people's lives change                                 there's a limit to how much you can                                 model                                 the lives of individuals and even the                                 European Court of Justice understands                                 that if you start defining models you                                 have to revisit them from time to time                                 and this is what we've seen for example                                 within the issues within the financial                                 sector they created models for hedge                                 funds and well the outcome wasn't great                                 and what we're seeing also is people are                                 getting more savvy about how their data                                 is being used so this is a friend of                                 mine Paul Olivia day you might have seen                                 him next to this guy called Christopher                                 Wylie with red hair in front of the                                 Europe in the UK Parliament he started a                                 movement a couple of years ago about how                                 to ask your data from Cambridge                                 analytical he worked then together with                                 the Guardian and from there well                                 basically he built a website where you                                 can ask for your date from Cambridge                                 analytical and so that information those                                 requests are called subject access                                 requests or SARS and this is a bit -                                 what I wanted to talk about today so                                 let's talk about the law this is the                                 representation the logo of the Dutch                                 Supervisory Authority I think they have                                 a good description of what's actually                                 going on it's not about personal data or                                 non personal data or analyzation data                                 it's about bits of me little bits that                                 come together and that in the end                                 certainly if I'm an outlier can define                                 me one way or another                                                 the United States                                 Latanya Sweeney showed that if you took                                 zip code dates of birth and gender you                                 could identify                                                          the United States this is a reality we                                 all know that we also know that with                                 four points of geolocation we know who                                 the person is and where that person                                 lives that's been proved by a Belgian                                 mathematician working for MIT so it                                 exists we know the power of data the                                 question is how are going to make                                 that were at least compliant and                                 hopefully built towards more ethical                                 data uses so if I had to sum up the GDP                                 are in one picture it's that I'm not                                 going to talk about everything but if                                 somebody asks you what is this thing                                 called GDP are send them the picture                                 nice and easy                                 what I did want to talk about a bit are                                 the obligations under the GDP are within                                 the data ecosystem and in that sense                                 that model kind of looks like this so in                                 the center are what's called data                                 controllers the banks the pharmaceutical                                 companies any company you do business                                 with or your customer of data controls                                 are responsible in front of data                                 subjects so the citizens they also use                                 tools behind them to do their processing                                 they're called data processors behind                                 there might be sub processors like cloud                                 service providers the big challenge                                 today as the GDP are before reinforces                                 these rights for data subjects is to                                 assure that well they can actually                                 comply with these rights so these are                                 the rights that I want to talk about and                                 what happens if people start complaining                                 or asking for their rights and the                                 companies don't reply well then these                                 data subjects comply complain to the                                 Supervisory authorities in this case                                 it's the ICO in the UK Germany has                                 supervise your authorities per lender so                                 that makes it interesting as well                                 certainly if you listen to                                 schleswig-holstein Hamburg or Berlin but                                 then these supervisor authorities who                                 have an obligation to take in those                                 complaints talk to data protection                                 officers within companies to make sure                                 that they have abided by the principles                                 and so a lot of companies are worried                                 that basically one well trouble is                                 coming which is true                                 but it's not as if the supervisor your                                 authorities are going to knock on the                                 door of companies and say hey here's a                                 bill for                                                                to ask questions just like I do when I                                 talk to processors and they aren't going                                 to have a conversation and where the                                 company the data controller will have to                                 prove that they are accountable and this                                 doesn't mean you have to solve for                                 everything but at least show you have                                 tried to do the right thing and it's                                 through these conversations that we'll                                 be able to do better so keep your eyes                                 open related to any questions that come                                 from supervisory authorities and please                                 try not to be too negative with legal                                 counsel knocks on your door so the                                 question that the the theme I want to                                 talk about today are data subject rights                                 so it's mainly article                                                are as I said                                                         some of them are actually not new so the                                 right to access that was introduced                                 within the GD P are back in the                                 directive actually is something that's                                 not new you as a data subject can send                                 an email to any company you're doing                                 business with and say what kind of data                                 do you have about me so think about that                                 what are the consequences of such rights                                 on the way your data is being processed                                 within your company article                                          about the right to rectification then                                 you kind of go down the line and be more                                 specific the right to erasure                                 the right to be forgotten you might have                                 heard about that's companies like a big                                 company in the United States compared to                                 book-burning                                 under the Nazi period like we don't                                 exactly look at it in the same way the                                 right to be forgotten is about making                                 sure that mistakes you've done in the                                 past will not continue to haunt you for                                 the next couple of years so what happens                                 to article                                                     interesting because things are obviously                                 moving and certainly since the GD P R                                 came into force                                 stances are changing two years ago when                                 we talk to processors and we said hey if                                 I get a request for deletion                                 will you help out and this is where most                                 processors would say no because it's not                                 PII                                 and this is where controllers say well                                 you know there are these fines so it                                 would be nice if we could actually align                                 and make sure that you can help us out                                 because I don't want to pay the fines                                 and so within the gdpr there's also an                                 obligation to make sure that this is                                 decided contractually speaking so the                                 name of the game for the moment has been                                 about signing data protection addendums                                 between processors and controllers                                 making sure the lawyers hedge for their                                 risk but the thing is those contracts                                 need to translate into what we actually                                 do with the data so this is where it                                 gets interesting because you need to                                 start looking at those contracts and                                 define and make sure that you agree on                                 what personal data is and this is often                                 a point of contention as well personal                                 data is not PII                                 personal data is broader than PII PII is                                 a subset of personal data it's been                                 defined per US state so there are                                    lists of PII in the United States hair                                 color is one in California who would                                 assault gender is considered personal                                 data in Spain most contracts so these                                 discussions about it is or it is not                                 we're actually not very useful because                                 basically what you're trying to do is                                 make sure that you can do business and                                 you're all accountable so think about                                 that when you use data merge data are                                 you getting closer to uniquely                                 identifying an individual or not I saw                                 interested in presentations yesterday                                 and one about IP addresses IP addresses                                 our personal data so was through that                                 presentation wondering about consent but                                 apparently the                                 the presentation wasn't about that in                                 any case data subject rights are not                                 rights that apply by default so this is                                 the position of MasterCard each company                                 will have their own position but what                                 certainly happens when people send                                 through those data subject requests is                                 that this is not going to happen                                 automatically                                 there are rules and definitions as to                                 when data subjects actually actually                                 apply so ideally your legal counsel or                                 privacy officer or ideally data                                 protection officer should think about                                 how these information these requests are                                 being received and how are they are                                 actually being passed down the line they                                 will not always apply but they'll have                                 to have a communication with the data                                 subjects to explain what's going on and                                 how they can actually do that and so                                 this is where I can share with you a lot                                 of legislation legislative bits but I                                 don't think it's very useful but it's                                 interesting to understand that you can't                                 really do this programmatically                                 certainly not in the beginning so                                 different reticles to take note of so I                                 think it's important to understand that                                 right to access is about the fact that I                                 want to know what type of data you have                                 about me so it's not I want a data dump                                 like from Facebook it's about what are                                 you using it's open question is a start                                 of a conversation with your customers to                                 understand what kind of data there's                                 there what's important to understand                                 also is that a company has one month to                                 reply so it doesn't mean that they need                                 to solve everything within one month but                                 they have an obligation to start that                                 conversation within one month so think                                 about that and how these processes will                                 be set up logically speaking you will                                 receive requests not from the outside                                 but from with                                 in your company to see how you can solve                                 it and have a conversation about that                                 so those subject access requests also                                 required to develop some form of                                 identification procedure if you're going                                 to share information with somebody who's                                 supposed to be a customer of yours or a                                 client or a user you have to make sure                                 that that person is actually who he or                                 she says she is and this is where                                 legislation is kind of a bit far from                                 your reality                                 typically the lawyers talk about asking                                 for a photocopy of the identity card of                                 the passport when we're talking about                                 for example the gaming sector and apps                                 on your mobile phones it wouldn't make                                 sense to actually ask for a photocopy I                                 can have direct links to data subject                                 requests where they can push through                                 their IDs related to the game that are                                 actually playing so be worried about                                 what lawyers say oh you need to                                 photocopy of the passport I don't want                                 to be sitting on data about people's                                 passports because that is also personal                                 data and God knows that needs to be                                 secured so think about these                                 identification procedures how would with                                 that work within the line of business                                 you are in if you're a bank it's not the                                 same thing as if your role of Yahoo does                                 Angry Birds so these are things to think                                 about the right rectification is about                                 this idea that well I don't want to have                                 wrong data about me following me around                                 a couple of months back I was listening                                 to the University of Kilburn who was                                 talking about group privacy and they                                 said imagine your grandchildren are                                 going to have decisions about their                                 lives                                 imported onto them because of stuff you                                 did                                                                     but this might happen if we're not                                 careful and if we don't think about well                                 you know how                                 our data is actually being managed how                                 long we keep it and if the quality of it                                 is actually any good so from the right                                 to rectification going down the list we                                 have the right to ratio and again it's                                 not an absolute right there are moments                                 when well these this data needs to be                                 kept typical examples are I am an                                 employee I have obligations to keep                                 employee data for five to seven years                                 depending on the country where I'm in                                 but it's important to acknowledge these                                 requests I get these requests I answer                                 within a month and I explain why it's                                 possible or it's not possible this is                                 also where we see that systems are                                 intricately linked with one another it's                                 not always easy to delete all the data                                 so a lot of systems what they're doing                                 is deleting the keys so that I can't                                 join it together anymore which is nice                                 it's a short-term solution to the                                 problem longer-term ideally that data                                 should expire be deleted to make sure                                 that you respect the data minimization                                 principle so sometimes when you think                                 about these requests it requires                                 different steps today we'll do this in                                                                                                     kicks in                                 the data will be deleted and so I can                                 make sure all the data is actually gone                                 so again these are conversations to have                                 with data subject to certain points but                                 certainly with supervisory authorities                                 on making sure you actually do the right                                 thing according to the accountability                                 principle so what's interesting within                                 our societies is that basically this                                 compliance obligation is not seen in the                                 same way by different actors certainly                                 if these actors are spread across                                 different continents with different                                 bases for the rule of law well basically                                 you have to have conversations with your                                 sub processors or your processors to                                 make sure that if you                                 controller you play the right role and                                 do not get the finds note that there is                                 a possibility to also then go against to                                 control the processors behind you to                                 push on the finds on to them as well so                                 again this idea of accountability we                                 created a data ecosystem now we're                                 trying to make sure that they abide by                                 the values within our societies so                                 something to note as well as this idea                                 of erasure actually applies to all the                                 copies you have as well and this is                                 where you can start thinking about best                                 practices if it applies to all copies                                 I've made and within my company I have                                 no problems with making copies of master                                 data maybe that's not the greatest of                                 ideas so basically the GD P R is trying                                 to solve for data quality making sure                                 the structure of your data is better set                                 better defined master data management                                 and data governance are clearly part of                                 the entire equation around compliance                                 and as I said before is it going to be                                 automated deletion well it depends again                                 on the type of company you are if I am                                 MasterCard or I'm visa or a bank                                 probably I log in somewhere I can ask                                 for deletion of my data through some                                 form of a portal it's not the same thing                                 if I'm a small start-up in San Francisco                                 so when lawyers say and you take you                                 have questions for the lawyers and they                                 actually say it depends well because it                                 does depend the way compliance works or                                 alignment with the gdpr depends on your                                 situation the type of data you have and                                 your structure as well it's like when                                 you ask things about technology should i                                 implement Kafka or streams or HDFS or                                 whatever it depends and this hasn't been                                 solved in like six months                                 we still see evolutions related to these                                 technologies as well so why would you                                 require from lawyers to actually have                                 the magical bullets at the same time and                                 within one                                 conversation of half-an-hour think about                                 it and think about this idea of                                 accountability and responsibility so                                 yeah so I think this is rather rather                                 clear other articles mainly articles                                                                                                           it's not just about access or deletion                                 or rectification it's about the fact                                 that well I don't want you to process my                                 data I understand that as a data subject                                 you need to process my data to send me                                 an invoice but I'm not super happy with                                 you profiling me and sending me specific                                 information about products I've never                                 asked for so this sits within the                                 restriction of processing which is                                 article                                                        consequences of that are interesting                                 because it means that you'll have to                                 flag certain customers who have not                                 agreed to certain processing operations                                 to exclude them from certain systems so                                 it means that you start to think about                                 what are those data processing                                 operations when I collect the data when                                 I process the data when I stream delay                                 that when I view the data processing is                                 very broad within the GDP are what do I                                 do with our data and what do I promise                                 that I will do with that data and how                                 can they make their choice known related                                 to what they want to be done with that                                 data so restriction of processing will                                 probably push you towards separating                                 your processing operations and also your                                 clients to make sure that you process                                 according to what they have agreed with                                 and what makes sense we used to be all                                 about let's collect everything and see                                 what's what comes out of it the GDP are                                 kind of pushes this back because of the                                 fines and because of well basically the                                 rights of data subjects towards an idea                                 of collect                                 what you need it doesn't say you're not                                 allowed to do anything anymore it says                                 you have to be accountable you have to                                 define what you're going to do with that                                 and in that sense that definition sits                                 within the notion of purpose there is a                                 reason why I collect something the                                 biggest challenge today is defining that                                 purpose but also how that purpose                                 actually stretches what are customer                                 expectations and how far when we stretch                                 that purpose how close do we get to                                 actually being creepy                                 so again expectations of customers and                                 trying to define why you're collecting                                 the data or maybe being well a bit more                                 conservative about everything that                                 you're collecting this is also where in                                 one of the presentations yesterday                                 somebody talked about agile companies                                 but also collaborative companies I had                                 never heard the term before but I think                                 it's really where we need to go towards                                 being agile allows you to move away from                                 this idea of let's collect everything                                 and in case we need it we'll see because                                 you're more agile you could actually go                                 back and collect what you need for a                                 further purpose being collaborative                                 means that through your different                                 departments you understand how you use                                 the data and it this is where I think we                                 should all strive towards data                                 portability is totally a new right                                 within the gdpr it's fascinating I think                                 data portability is really interesting                                 the way companies here today is the                                 obligation to push out data if citizens                                 want it so it doesn't go any further                                 than that                                 what is interesting within that as well                                 is this idea that well it doesn't                                 include inferred data so it's all the                                 data that's basically customers have                                 shared with you or have shared through                                 clicking on websites or different uses                                 of their tools or things that                                 that if you define that somebody has a                                 high pension for suicide probably that's                                 not part of data portability so data                                 portability is about this idea of what                                 do I have about customers that they gave                                 me and how do I push it out the long                                 term idea is data democratization if we                                 get more and more companies helping                                 customers gets there subject access                                 requests we kind of creates a pile of                                 data that data could actually serve in                                 solving other kinds of problems and this                                 is where I think Europe has an advantage                                 I looked for example at the presentation                                 yesterday from the transportation                                 industry in Norway which was interesting                                 but collaboration between public and                                 private companies is basically what data                                 portability is all about the thing is                                 the gdpr doesn't define that market GDP                                 are just says you have to push out the                                 data and then we'll see what else is                                 going to be created I think this is the                                 biggest opportunity within the GDP our                                 except for data quality and making sure                                 we build moving forward for better                                 societies overall a last one article                                    which is also being discussed a lot                                 certainly within digital is this                                 discussion about you have to write not                                 to be subject to automated                                 decision-making including profiling so                                 the interesting part of this is well if                                 you gave explicit consent that doesn't                                 apply so if somebody says I don't want                                 to be profiled                                 I don't want to have automated                                 decision-making about me but that person                                 gave their consent                                 this is one of these rules that you need                                 to have within your systems to say it's                                 based on explicit consent so what you                                 should do is                                 to withdraw your consent which is                                 something that is defined within the                                 gdpr then we can have a conversation                                 about this                                 the reason this exists is because well                                 these kinds of automated decision-making                                 are actually making decisions about our                                 lives so the typical examples for this                                 are credit scoring if I ask for a credit                                 at a bank and I get refused I can ask                                 for an explanation I can ask to say okay                                 what did you do and where does it                                 actually come from so it can happen                                 actually before you start a contract                                 with a company so it basically allows                                 for more transparency within the data                                 world which is I think rather important                                 it is also possible to use this and I                                 won't read everything if we're talking                                 about legitimate interests so one of the                                 presentations yesterday talked about the                                 different ways to make data processing                                 lawful there are six ways to make data                                 processing lawful within the GDP our                                 consent is just one of them and                                 obviously the other one is legitimate                                 interest but the thing is the GDP are                                 also says that a company can use that                                 lawful basis of processing in their                                 legitimate interest if it doesn't go                                 against the fundamental rights of data                                 subjects so while I understand that                                 legitimate interest is an interesting                                 way to assure that your processing is                                 lawful it also kind of feels more like a                                 philosophical essay about data subject                                 harms then actually pushing data through                                 consent mechanisms so if somebody tells                                 you all we're using legitimate interest                                 be worry about that make sure that they                                 have done their homework related to that                                 I know it's not your job but legitimate                                 interest is not a wild card to do                                 whatever you want                                 when it comes to data processing                                 profiling defined within article                                    is broader than what it used to be I'm                                 talking to certain American lawyers what                                 they basically said it's profiling is                                 very bad word in European legislation                                 and it's true so if you are going to do                                 profiling one way or another there are                                 obligations sorry to undergo what's                                 called data protection impact                                 assessments it's basically a list of                                 questions you have to go through and                                 which will define measures to make sure                                 that your compliance obligations are                                 well balanced if you work within these                                 kinds of projects it's great to have DP                                 is because dpi is support accountability                                 and support documentation as well and                                 you can find them within the French                                 Supervisory authorities the Spaniards                                 everybody has their lists of data                                 protection impact assessments these are                                 great tools to make sure that you are                                 compliant so look for them it's not fun                                 but at least it allows you to understand                                 what you can do and what you can't do                                 and to actually prove you have done the                                 right thing if somebody knocks on your                                 door so automated decision makings                                 basically as I said credit score's loans                                 educational scoring or I talked about                                 the fact that my grandchildren might be                                 rated based on what I did I'm very                                 scared about the data that is being                                 collected by my children but let's see                                 what happens in in the long term but if                                 they get refused into any kind of                                 education I as a European subject have                                 the right to ask where that information                                 comes from and again it's based on this                                 idea of the Charter of Fundamental                                 Rights even though the gdpr doesn't talk                                 about discrimination                                 it's about this it's about making sure                                 we can live fulfilled lives in the long                                 term and there are still issues that are                                 really open out there price                                 discrimination by Airlines is that                                 lawful we'll see how the courts will                                 figure that one out                                 so if I had to wrap out the reality                                 check at least in my digital world                                 well usually technology looks like this                                 and where I see also companies talking a                                 lot about digital transformation or data                                 leaks or Big Data projects but without a                                 lot of structure around it so it would                                 be interesting and this is what the GD P                                 R is trying to push to start making sure                                 you are accountable for your data                                 processing operation and understand how                                 that data is actually being used note                                 that a lot of tools that I use today                                 even though they have for example                                 consent mechanisms don't even talk about                                 purpose so this is what we need to start                                 thinking about moving forward some                                 numbers so the GD P R got enforced on                                 the                                                          the Dutch received                                                       first week the Irish Supervisory                                 Authority which is an interesting door                                 for American companies on the European                                  continent                                                         estimating at                                                         year                                  note that the Spanish LPD is the closest                                  to the GDP or so for them it's piece of                                  cake they haven't finished their                                  implementation of the GDP are yet the                                  law is not there they'll probably add                                  new stuff                                  knowing the Spaniards on our side as DPO                                  for a customer data platform called M                                  particle we have received over                                        requests now we can solve for about                                      of them and why is that well because                                  identity is not easy to define so I just                                  want to have a quick show of hands who                                  knows what an idea phase what's an idea                                  thing Apple IDs for advertising who                                  knows what I died these are Google IDs                                  yes do you know where to find them                                  you know where to find the idea of a                                  specific app and how do you feel a                                  subject access request well basically                                  you just send an email to the company                                  and see what comes back it's a nice                                  exercise and does anybody know how to                                  complain to the supervisory authority or                                  usually you go to their website and                                  you'll find one way or another to                                  complain to them so I'd like to finish                                  with this the legislation is not perfect                                  I hear complaining about it every day                                  it's like how the legislation is so                                  unclear it's not a technical requirement                                  that's your job                                  the job of lawyers is to work together                                  and supervisory authorities to make sure                                  that well we understand each other and                                  we foster data exchanges and certainly                                  defined purpose of the uses of our data                                  I'm happy with the                                                      at M particle we're trying to find ways                                  to make that better and what we should                                  actually focus on is as I mentioned                                  purpose classification what are you                                  using the data for and this is where you                                  have conversations with your legal                                  counsel to say I'm using it for this is                                  that description good enough how we                                  might add that kind of work to make sure                                  that it's a bit extendable these are                                  known practices you can do that but you                                  have to start working on this idea of                                  purpose classification God knows Apple                                  has started in                                                           access personal data on your mobile                                  phone unless a certain field was filled                                  in the big question is what is Apple                                  sitting on currently and the mystery                                  hasn't been unfolded yet                                  ideally purpose should look like                                  accounting within a company money comes                                  in money goes out they are accounting                                  principles this is what we need to build                                  for data as well and things like consent                                  rails traceability or lineage are things                                  that are starting to exist now we have                                  to start to work together to make sure                                  that accountability actually works                                  across the data ecosystem so I started                                  my career when that one came out the                                  data deluge I was like ah so much data                                  great I don't have to go to the                                  statistical Society in Belgium and get                                  diskettes about information I'm really                                  happy about that but due to the history                                  of my family and the fact that I'm an                                  outlier I'm really worried about the                                  future of our societies as well and this                                  is where basically we need your help                                  thinking about what is the GDP are                                  trying to accomplish in order to make                                  sure that we built better societies                                  moving forward so I couldn't say enough                                  read the Charter of Fundamental Rights                                  if you don't want to read the GDP are                                  it's fine but read the Charter of                                  Fundamental Rights because basically                                  that's all we're trying to solve for                                  thank you very much                                  thank you so much aurélie oh we got some                                  time for one or two questions                                  other questions remarks comments in the                                  audience this is a question I'm not sure                                  well I got one orally or coming from the                                  technical side of things our building                                  data systems I'm wondering how we can                                  better navigate this gray zone of is my                                  system compliant or not what does it                                  does it allow for compliance II we have                                  there's a wonderful ecosystem of the                                  Apache big data stack mm-hm and we build                                  solutions out of many different                                  components dozens if not hundreds do we                                  now start need to start putting stamps                                  compliancy stems on components and say                                  hey with this I'm sure I I persist                                  buffer cache data but I can also remove                                  it yeah it depends I think that when we                                  talk about compliance as I showed in the                                  beginning compliance to GDP our means a                                  lot of things and the first discussions                                  we had was basically about where the                                  data was so if you want to talk about                                  compliance of systems probably the first                                  question to ask is where is your data                                  what are we talking about                                  so the GDP are doesn't want to not allow                                  data to go beyond Europe but it would                                  like for fundamental rights to be on the                                  same level for the country where the                                  data is also going so usually the first                                  questions are about those systems and                                  when they're distributed what kind of                                  countries are you using and are you                                  making sure that the rights of                                  individuals are also abided by within                                  these different countries the next                                  question then is often are you                                  collecting personal data which then                                  opens up in Pandora's box because as we                                  saw personal data is pretty broad but I                                  think the general idea is to say well                                  there are principles within the GDP are                                  can I abide by them is my data fair do I                                  have data retention periods I should go                                  down the checklist and then making sure                                  that I have a method for processing data                                  in the lawful way so you can basically                                  build checklist relate to that and then                                  have conversations about when you                                  you're not sure and try to define ways                                  to mitigate your risk related to being                                  compliant because it's about that it's                                  about mitigating the potential risk that                                  somebody complains or somebody knocks on                                  your door to say that's not good thank                                  you other questions in the meantime well                                  if not all this concludes our keynote                                  session oh thank you again thank you                                  very much
