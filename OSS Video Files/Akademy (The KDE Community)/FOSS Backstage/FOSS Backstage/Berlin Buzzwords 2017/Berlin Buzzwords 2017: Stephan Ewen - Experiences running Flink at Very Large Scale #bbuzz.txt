Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2017: Stephan Ewen - Experiences running Flink at Very Large Scale #bbuzz
Publication date: 2017-06-15
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2017
Description: 
	This talk shares experiences from deploying and tuning Flink steam processing applications for very large scale. We share lessons learned from users, contributors, and our own experiments about running demanding streaming jobs at scale. 

The talk will explain what aspects currently render a job as particularly demanding, show how to configure and tune a large scale Flink job, and outline what the Flink community is working on to make the out-of-the-box for experience as smooth as possible. We will, for example, dive into - analyzing and tuning checkpointing - selecting and configuring state backends - understanding common bottlenecks - understanding and configuring network parameters.
