Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2017: Tommaso Teofili, Suneel Marthi - Diversity: searching over multiple languages
Publication date: 2017-06-15
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2017
Description: 
	Although a lot of online content is written in English there’re tons of non English users out there that still need to retrieve information. When searching, especially for tech related topics, it’s common to compose queries in English; however for such users search results written in their own native language may be preferred.

We’ll see how statistical machine translation tools can help in the above scenario to perform text translation at query time, resulting in an improved recall and precision for the search engine queries.

We’ll be having a look at how cross language information retrieval can be implemented on top of Apache Lucene with the help of Apache Joshua machine translation toolkit.

The audience would gain a better understanding of how to be able to make search queries against a multilingual corpora indexed into Apache Lucene and being able to retrieve all of the relevant search results in different languages.

	                              thank you thanks everyone for coming in                               and I hope                               so far at Boylan buzzwords this is my                               second talk today in lesson product by                               now so I'm so why is this one whole                               thing so I am so Neil Marty and I both                               had red hat and I'm based out of                               Washington DC in Virginia and I'm a                               member of a Tai Chi foundation and I'm a                                committed on attaching the hood open NLP                                and Apache streams and I also mentor a                                few projects in the packing sapater                                my name is Tomas de awfully I work at                                Adobe Systems as a software engineer I'm                                also a member of the Apache Software                                Foundation and contributing to a bunch                                of projects there so like leucine Joshua                                open NLP check rabbit and a few others                                yes okay so when I say what is                                multilingual search so we are going to                                be talking about multilingual search                                what is multilingual search and why do                                we need multilingual search and what is                                statistical machine translation have                                folks word about that before statistical                                machine translation okay and overview of                                Apache Joshua and a dataflow pipeline                                for the demo we have coming up and we                                have a demo so the first question is                                what is multilingual search so how often                                how many of you are non non English                                speakers Here I am one of course yeah                                pretty much all of most of us here so                                has it ever annoyed you that most of the                                content we have on the web is always is                                all in English and you would rather                                prefer something in native languages                                rather you see the search results in                                your native languages so so most of the                                content we have is in different                                languages and all of the speak different                                languages of speak different languages                                so when you want to do a search you                                would rather search on takes that is in                                English as well as in the different                                languages and you also want to be able                                to do a query in your native language                                right and most of the time when you do                                this you have you have a parallel                                corpora that is you have the text in                                English and the text in German and you                                line them up to see the transfer what                                the translation looks like sometimes you                                got to translate the user queries itself                                and sometimes you got to translate the                                documents                                so that you can retrieve your results so                                given that that's one of the reasons why                                you would need multilingual search so if                                we look at the online content we have                                today the Wikipedia dumps the English                                content is                                                         quantity                                                                                                                                    here it's mostly English the content is                                English and as most of the audience here                                is non-english speakers                                and most of the search queries we do are                                pretty much in English like a search for                                a scalar product that a vector product                                or whatever and I would rather prefer                                that the search results are retrieved                                when I get back the search results is                                translated back into the native language                                the language I would prefer even                                consolidate all of the different results                                from the different corporal corporal                                like in English and German or Italian                                all consolidate all the results into one                                common language so that's what we are                                talking about by embracing diversity                                when you are talking about embracing                                diversity here so for example here                                tomaso is Italian Italian obviously so                                when you stick a search for a scalar                                product the results is getting back from                                Google is it's all in Italian the first                                search result is an Italian search                                result so that's the kind of that's what                                you would prefer when I doing a search                                and last year the US Department of it's                                actually the national intelligence                                department they have a contest in still                                running called materials so you want to                                be able to make a query in English                                search over the content in all the                                different languages let's say if I want                                to do a query about terrorism and I want                                to search all the different languages                                 and across the web consolidate all the                                 translate all the content into English                                 summarize the content in English and get                                 the results back in English and this is                                 something the national intelligence of                                 the US government wants to do that                                 second test they have now it's still                                 active so this is one of the reasons why                                 you need multilingual search so what is                                 machine translation                                 so machine translation have the folks                                 have any idea what machine translation                                 is or anyone who is actually into this                                 search an information retrieval                                 okay                                 so basically you have statistical models                                 that are trained so you have let's say                                 if I am trying to do a create a model                                 that is translating from English to                                 German or German to English I create a                                 language pack for that how do I do that                                 I have all the content I line up all the                                 sentences so sentence here from here and                                 the sentence here from the same document                                 translated document I line up all the                                 sentences and I tried to create mapping                                 say the phrase based mappings I can take                                 a phrase and in a map this map this                                 single word from here to might I would                                 see multiple words here or a phrase from                                 here to the place here and it's kind of                                 it happens based on a probability                                 distribution if you are familiar with                                 base patient theorem so probability of e                                 use a string in a target language which                                 is English for example and the source                                 language is your French Spanish and a of                                 F and you are trying to calculate the                                 probability of F and you can help                                 several probabilities but the                                 probability that you choose is the max                                 probability okay EF f is AD max this is                                 the Bayes rule a family of the Bayes                                 theorem and this is the best translation                                 the one with the highest probability is                                 what you pick from the certain                                 probabilities that you get and that we                                 look at that how it works so there are                                 different ways of doing the machine                                 translation one of them is word based                                 translation and here basically how do                                 you translate a word I can look up in a                                 dictionary for example like we try on a                                 German here Jib all day they get it                                 right okay Jabar day it could be either                                 a building or a house or a tower and you                                 can have multiple translations of that                                 in English so some of them are more                                 frequent so for example Tower is not                                 that frequently used so building and                                 house are more frequently used so you                                 got to figure out which one do I pick as                                 the correct translation for a word                                 so another example is if I look at the                                 translation of your body and if I'm                                 looking at I do a Google search for the                                 house I get five point two eight billion                                 hits on Google and for building I get                                 four point one six and for tower I get                                 nine point two eight billion so that                                 should be million yep sorry                                 that's million and for each of them you                                 calculate the probability so obviously                                 the house has the highest probability of                                                                           the tower has the lowest lease                                 probability of                                                     translation for you body G body would be                                 house so find me so how do you do this                                 now so what you have to do is we got to                                 align your text you can take a text from                                 English and you can take a text from                                 German and we align all the words in the                                 language for example does Gabor day is                                 talk okay was a good yeah so the                                 building is high there's a translation                                 so I translate and map the words does                                 does B and this is the building is is                                 oak high and I get the word position so                                 the word positions are                                                 you do that so when you do this                                 alignment you've got to calculate and we                                 come up with an alignment function and                                 an alignment function example of an                                 alignment function is you map each                                 English word to the corresponding                                 position to the German word so we mapped                                 each eye English word I had position I                                 think a German word position J for                                 example in the previous one it was                                 one-to-one mapping one                                                 four                                                                  could have one too many translations so                                 does is ain't Hawk horse okay the                                 translator this is a high-rise building                                 so this one word maps to three different                                 English words so that's when alignment                                 that's what the state alignment function                                 I rise building okay so these are some                                 of the things that you need to factor in                                 when you're building your machine in our                                 translation language models and so this                                 is word based translation and word based                                 translation is not used all that much                                 now and the words use novice praise                                 based translation returns map your                                 phrases so in word based models you have                                 the words as your atomic unit whereas in                                 phrase based models you translate                                 phrases and you treat your phrases as                                 atomic units so the advantages of going                                 with a phrase based model is please you                                 have many too many translations that can                                 handle non compositional places phrases                                 like in the previous one                                 had a cause mapping to high-rise                                 building it is a non compositional                                 phrase right so you can with race-based                                 translation you can actually map that                                 better and the more data you have and                                 the longer phrases you can learn longer                                 phrases and better you can learn by the                                 phrases and this is kind of the standard                                 model that Google uses for Google                                 Translate engine so for example in a                                 phrase based model I have a sentence in                                 German Berlin East End has her Oregon                                 days constituent quilt or zentrum okay                                 was it good yes                                 so which translates to Berlin is an                                 outstanding art and outstanding art and                                 cultural center so this phrase my apps                                 do have phrase here right and so                                 basically you segment your input into                                 phrases and you translate each other                                 phrases into English and you need to                                 reorder your phrases when you translate                                 that back into German or English you                                 need to reorder the phrases to get a                                 correct syntax so when you do this when                                 you build your language models the next                                 step is when you are actually coming to                                 do a static translation machine                                 translation you've got to decode your                                 inputs with them based on the models so                                 for decoding that we have a mathematical                                 model for translation so for example                                 based on the probabilities find the                                 translation the best translation with                                 the highest probability so based on the                                 probabilities that you have for each of                                 the phrases you calculate the phrase                                 probabilities for each of the phrases                                 and pick the phrase with the highest                                 probability and when you do this there                                 are two types of errors that could occur                                 the most probable translation is already                                 bad so we go to fix our models or you                                 don't find the most probable translation                                 at all so you go to fix a search when                                 you do the search so for example when                                 your translation the way the translation                                 process works is so let's say I have                                 this German sentence trinket yarn or                                 nique okay when I translate this it's a                                 translates to he and then that's a                                 phrase here this yarn oak Nick's is a                                 phrase so that translates to does not                                 yet or it's quite quite close to that                                 and shrinkage is drink so                                 so that's that's how you translate that                                 based on the phrases l trinket yeah                                 knock Nick's he does not yet drink right                                 so here you are reordering the words so                                 the drink instead of showing up here it                                 shows up here we are in the words okay                                 with that do you have any questions so                                 far on this okay I'll turn it over to                                 Tommaso who is going to be talking about                                 Apache Joshua and doing a demo of how                                 this works okay                                 thanks Cindy so Apache Joshua is a                                 statistical machine translation project                                 that was originally developed by Johns                                 Hopkins University and UPenn and got                                 into the incubator something like                                      if year and a half ago or something like                                 that and actually today we're probably                                 going our first incubating release so it                                 took it took us quite a while to to get                                 along with all the process the Apache                                 Software Foundation and fix some                                 licensing and and other stuff but we're                                 we're being the project is being used by                                 already at Amazon and just propulsion                                 laboratory at NASA and also integrated I                                 mean and there are open issues to                                 integrate with other projects at the                                 Apache Software Foundation like Apache                                 Solr                                 or tikka that has a translation API and                                 even in the jackrabbit oak content                                 repository so a very cool thing about                                 Joshua is that it comes out basically as                                 a tool that you can already use out of                                 the box so the release we're going to                                 have out in a few hours is basically a                                 source release so that you can use it to                                 build and train your own statistical                                 machine translation                                 model but also we provide a few binary                                 distributions of language packs                                 something like                                                  language packs for different language                                 payers which you can basically unpack                                 and use from the command line and that's                                 actually one of the things we're working                                 on also on the Java side that a lot of                                 basically it was built as a tool that                                 you can use for example within your bash                                 scripts but also you can start up a                                 server and you can do HTTP requests and                                 you get HTTP responses so something like                                 a separate component in your environment                                 and the scenario depending on what you                                 need                                 but what we're also working on is to                                 integrate it as a as a library that you                                 can use from basically programmatically                                 and that's requiring something some work                                 that we're going to do there to remove                                 some things that scripts or at least to                                 make it possible to use different things                                 so for example we have an open issue to                                 use NLP library open NLP to do the                                 pre-processing of the text while                                 building the machine translation model                                 instead of scripts that we have in the                                 in the release the source release so                                 here are I hope they read well enough a                                 couple of possible flows so because here                                 we are talking about Joshua in the                                 context of or basically machine                                 translation in the context of search and                                 here are basically two slightly                                 different scenarios so in the left left                                 one you have that the user query string                                 comes together with a user profile and                                 if you think about the use case one that                                 we we showed basically the picture from                                 the                                 Google search let me go back a bit here                                 that's basically what happens I mean I'm                                 not saying in any way that I am Italian                                 I mean I just typed scalar product so I                                 mean Google is not doing that via the                                 website basically it's not because I'm                                 using Google Doc IT or Google dot B so                                 perhaps it's just because I'm logged in                                 with my Google account so it uses my                                 profile data to decide whether or not                                 provided machine translated we use a                                 machine translated query and which which                                 language translate to so here what we                                 have so imagine that we have liking that                                 in the demo that we will see afterwards                                 we have two decoders basically two                                 models machine translation models that                                 can do translation for example from                                 English to Italian or English to German                                 so the user profile is used to pick up                                 the right decoder and in that case what                                 we have is that the query the user                                 entered query gets enhanced and you have                                 that the translated query is added as                                 using a loose in kind of slang as a                                 boolean queries so you have the original                                 query written in the end in English for                                 example scalar product but you also have                                 the translated query within the                                 translated language which is proto                                 Scolari                                 and therefore you get that the searcher                                 gets queried with with a query which                                 basically in two versions and that's one                                 thing on the other end we could have                                 another use case which is slightly                                 different so instead of using the user                                 profile what we use is that we detect                                 the language                                 in which the user query string was                                 written and then do a search using also                                 other decoders that we have so if it's                                 written in English we can provide also a                                 query in Italian or in German so in the                                 first case what we are looking for is to                                 improve the precision of our search                                 engine so basically for me as a user on                                 the search engine it indicates for                                 example of tech related content and                                 topics is probably easier and preferable                                 to read content that's written my native                                 language so I get the native the the                                 result written in the native language                                 first right so I get the best results                                 first so I get an improved precision on                                 the other end on the in the second in                                 the second use case what what what is                                 doing is that I'm basically providing                                 more results in the yoke that among                                 those results those are relevant enough                                 to the end users so what we have is that                                 we avoid missing results that could be                                 useful to the end user by doing machine                                 translation and there is an interesting                                 extension of these of these use case so                                 for example machine translation can also                                 do paraphrase translation so if you have                                 corpora a parallel corpora having                                 basically two different versions of the                                 same sentence both in English what you                                 can do here instead of translating the                                 query from English to Italian or from                                 English to German you do English to                                 English translation and so you basically                                 look to improving again the recall the                                 the probability that the search the user                                 entered query matches results on your                                 own your search engine                                 and this is basically just for                                 translating the user query another thing                                 that we we discussed in the used case                                 too is native only so how is it useful                                 or is it useful to have results                                 translated into your native language so                                 this thing here is a feature in Google                                 search that was disabled is translated                                 for in pages something like three or                                 four years ago because it was based in                                 not used very much by the end users and                                 that's fine for the web search probably                                 but on the other end we have other use                                 cases like mentioned by sunil where                                 these can be useful or and one thing                                 that i would like you to think his to as                                 the title of the talk to embrace                                 diversity so when we do things when we                                 decide how to set up our search engine                                 and now to whether doing machine                                 translation or not or on query or                                 document side what are we what do we                                 want to do for our for our end users so                                 we do not want to skip that just because                                 i don't know google or whatever other                                 provided decided to discard it so think                                 of for example use case of refugees and                                 i mean are immigrants we have lots of                                 such stories where basically news is                                 full of such stories so if i as a                                 refugee and since search is a tool that                                 is the entry point of kind of every                                 application web application system or i                                 mean it's an important one if users                                 would be allowed to search in their                                 native land                                 age the query being translated into                                 English getting English results and then                                 back translated into their native                                 language so think if you come from as a                                 refugee really is it's something that                                 and we have such systems we have we have                                 been talking on the Joshua mailing list                                 with someone building such systems we're                                 basically doing machine translation is                                 not just a cool thing for precision and                                 recall metrics for information from the                                 information retrieval work but I've just                                 think that help users and people at the                                 end of their day so yeah that's I think                                 an important point to to make when                                 thinking about this is feature so and                                 before going in a quick demo I think                                 there are a few reference is here and                                 credits to people that help setting up                                 this list oh yeah these are the folks                                 that helped us put together the stock                                 join us here right here yeah                                 hands up Matt post is the PNC chair of                                 Apache you're sure and this is based on                                 John Hopkins University Baltimore and a                                 Bruno is in New Zealand he helped us                                 with a slide deck yeah yeah so let's get                                 us into                                 okay so I have downloaded Wikipedia                                 dance from for English English German                                 and Italian and index them in Toulouse                                 in and then downloaded joschwa decoders                                 in the in this case we are using the                                 decoder                                 that's translate from English to German                                 so setting up the decor we are setting                                 up the decoder and then we are using the                                 open up NLP unreleased language                                 detection tool to do the language                                 detection component that we we've seen                                 in the in the diagram so and I mean this                                 is I hope it reads you know no can you                                 in the background read well enough okay                                 okay so what are you basically that the                                 important piece here is that we have                                 that the listen query but we have                                 sketched up and improved and improved                                 query parser which does the flow that we                                 have seen basically detecting the                                 language in which the query was written                                 and picking up the right machine                                 translation model and doing the machine                                 translation and adding the machine                                 translated query as a boolean query for                                 Racine so here we are writing in German                                 so I don't know                                 Berlin is wrong sorry in English and we                                 want her yeah mixed up so here we didn't                                 get anything different because basically                                 restaurant is one of those words which                                 doesn't have a lot of I mean it's kind                                 of                                 where that exists in in different                                 languages still we'll see that we have                                 results coming from both English and                                 German content so while here what we                                 have is that the that quick language was                                 Type O for I am in Berlin is English and                                 so I it gets translated into hitch pin                                 in Berlin                                 something like that and so the Racine                                 query gets expanded so from text I am                                 Berlin peckish pin Berlin and so here we                                 get both the results from German and                                 English but we put the German one                                 upwards because it's basically the more                                 relevant so exactly the same as in the                                 case of color product yeah so that's and                                 we can do a lot of such example queries                                 and see how the search engine can angle                                 and all this and the query gets                                 translate translated yeah                                 so here this bitter question can you                                 repeat the question the question is how                                 does the translation work if there's a                                 typo in the user query right okay so the                                 way you can do it you can do it either                                 involve in two different ways at least                                 so one way is to design dedicated spell                                 checkers for for dedicated language but                                 on the other and what you can also do is                                 so when building the statistical machine                                 translation model you can provide the                                 language model with some parameters so                                 something like you build an Engram                                 language models when you can and in the                                 hand-ground basically of like a three                                 gram use placed a sentence in chunks of                                 three characters each so in when when                                 you use such language models when                                 building the language pack the language                                 model becomes sort of the statistical                                 machine translation model becomes kind                                 of less impacted by those typos because                                 doesn't really rely on just words but on                                 portions of words and probabilities of                                 words of chunks of such chunks to to                                 stick together in the same sentence                                 in the same sequence so that's the way                                 you can you can handle this yeah like so                                 these do you have enough sign X                                    minutes okay so in this this case is                                 slightly different so we have that we                                 write we do the other thing so we write                                 in our native language and we will get                                 the results in in English language and                                 again this I think is you can pick of                                 useful scenarios for this as well so                                 again think about                                 refugees or people that looks for asylum                                 in a certain country and need some                                 paperwork to be done and so we need to                                 get the results some some forms to fill                                 in and print and they need the one in in                                 English for example if they want to go                                 to England so as soon as it loads yeah                                 and so I mean yeah yeah does this                                 already support the phrase based model                                 and yeah also if you can in specific                                 language domains if you can insert some                                 some language phrases which are not like                                 fashion language for example or                                 sometimes you can you repeat that neh                                 can you teach the model to learn more                                 words is it though if it's an online                                 kind of not on learning let's say I have                                 my own dictionary of a language there's                                 not a general language so can I ingest                                 yeah type of language inside and if you                                 support the phrase based model outside                                 of the box world languages so most of                                 those language packs or phrases models I                                 could say phrase based and I think                                 syntax based it's kind of a mix so                                 definitely can do that and the more                                 content you have your the better much                                 better your praise or serve and so and                                 we also have discussed on the mailing                                 list the possibility of introducing                                 something like so you build your model                                 from your data first and then at some                                 point you realize you have to adjust it                                 or feed in something else so we talked                                 about also including some sort of rules                                 or things that you can add afterwards to                                 the model so that it's not like online                                 learning but I mean you can still do                                 something on an existing model without                                 having to retrain the whole thing I just                                 want to follow up in that so let's say I                                 have one keyword in the German language                                 do I supply all the possible                                 translations for languages and that                                 would be use directly in the phrase base                                 model to sort of work so you get a list                                 of candidates with scores and so                                 basically there you can either decide                                 you what to do with it from the from the                                 model from the output basically of the                                 Joshua decode that I want to teach I                                 wanted to I mean from so I had my own                                 language I mean and I want to teach                                 various foreign graduate on models for                                 the different languages and you can                                 create the translation from your                                 language to which our language the                                 target language is perfect thank you                                 yeah yeah sorry so I don't know it's                                 something like an Italian pizza                                 so this is something like I need                                 documents to to get into Berlin                                 something like that or bit paperwork or                                 something like that so and here we have                                 the English translation so I forgot to                                 say that this one translated from                                 Italian to English so here the document                                 apparently no gets translated into                                 documents to enter Berlin and again the                                 machine query gets announced and here I                                 get italian documents but yeah that's                                 basically just because we asked us does                                 settings of putting italian document                                 first but we also have a busy medical                                 documents first but we also have the                                 english one coming so I'm sure someone                                 may ask about neuro machine translation                                 so I want to prefer to get this question                                 in advance so we asked the discussed                                 about about this in the george for                                 mailing list so at the moment Joshua is                                 is not neural neural network based it's                                 just based on statistical models                                 statistical models like suniye explained                                 beforehand but I mean I've read a bit                                 some papers about that we we've read                                 some papers about that and while I think                                 that there are very interesting things                                 about about those models like for                                 example a paper claim to be able to                                 extract something like a meta language                                 that can be used in all kinds of                                 translations I don't remember if it was                                 the mind related but basically the the                                 key thing is I mean I would suggest that                                 we think to this not not not just to the                                 tools let's                                 so here we've presented the demo built                                 upon the scene open NLP and Joshua but                                 it could be also something different I                                 mean and I don't think it's so just a                                 matter of what's better but what best                                 suits your needs and and stuff like that                                 so rather than so focus on the user                                 rather than the tools yeah hello so I                                 have question regarding overlapping                                 vocabulary of the languages so during                                 the language section in gin now if let's                                 say German and English there are some                                 words overlapping then how do you detect                                 that it's a German or it's English or if                                 the word so you mean in the languages                                 detection or in the building the machine                                 translation model in language detection                                 maybe okay you say overlapping are we                                 talking about the same word in two                                 languages yeah so for example whoa it                                 was like we have it sounds like who in                                 English but you write like very injure                                 so the the one way to disambiguate that                                 is to go with larger and character grams                                 and go with more data and more character                                 diagrams right now so that we can design                                 bigger in English and German when you                                 have similar words showing up in both so                                 you go with the phrases right I mean it                                 don't go by the word go by the phrase                                 it's part of yeah it's the context that                                 is a context up so you cannot say if the                                 Berlin is German or English word just by                                 Berlin even you you as a human this is                                 for language addiction right not ever so                                 idea yeah Yan could say better so                                 regards yeah                                 so going back to machine translation in                                 the so back to the context of machine                                 translation in search are I think that                                 the biggest obstacle to our being able                                 to support the features that you                                 described earlier is as always getting                                 parallel corpora are there may be ways                                 or techniques in which one might be able                                 to construct more easily a parallel                                 corpus for for the search queries in                                 particular if if the task at hand is to                                 first translate the query before to                                 search in other languages maybe well as                                 I forget as usual I mean you're right                                 it's an issue and especially I mean                                 short text is a challenge for a lot of                                 NLP related techniques or statistical                                 basic techniques I mean like doing                                 sentiment analysis on Twitter is not                                 difficult as difficult as it is for                                 large stocks because you have less                                 context there so I mean yeah at the                                 moment I don't have a correct or I don't                                 know proper answer to say yeah there is                                 this very nice way which you can do with                                 with with small text but I mean for what                                 I can say is for example has been                                 experimenting with neural networks for                                 other kind of topics and because yeah                                 you know nowadays it's all about that                                 and it's basically this I mean it's                                 basically the same yeah you need to have                                 enough data to have something that                                 really works in the end and it's still                                 an issue with open data so we are                                 poaching the end we can still take one                                 maybe two more questions                                 let's connect the government ears like                                 that                                 yeah thanks I'm just a very quick                                 follow-up question on that um what's the                                 culprit that you use for the for the                                 ready-made language banks that you                                 included ah it's a nice question there                                 is a wiki page right back it's gonna                                 slide that crier I just go back yeah I                                 know yeah in language packs yeah                                 I mean but you can't I succeeded okay so                                 we have about                                                    pre-canned                                 and crane for different conversions

                        so you showed languages that have a very                                 similar structure like Italian and                                 German in English like right from the                                 general principle they're pretty similar                                 as a whole well does it work with say                                 Chinese or African languages if you have                                 the language model for those languages                                 yes let's scroll down now there is a                                 rabbit
