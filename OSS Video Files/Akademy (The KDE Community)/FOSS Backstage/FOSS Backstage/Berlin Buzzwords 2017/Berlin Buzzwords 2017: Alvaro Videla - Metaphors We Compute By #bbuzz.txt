Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2017: Alvaro Videla - Metaphors We Compute By #bbuzz

Description: 
	We think in words, we talk with words, we understand the world thanks to words. Metaphors take words to the next level explaining concepts that were escaping our understanding before. In 1980 George Lakoff revolutionised the Linguistic and Philosophic worlds when he studied how metaphors affect our thinking, how they influence our actions and even shape who we are. What happens with the metaphors that we use in the Software Industry?

In this talk we are going to review the importance that metaphors have in our code quality, in the algorithms we choose, and the products we ship. 

As a practical example we are going to see why Microservices and Containers have been so successful in the past couple of years. We'll try to understand why they have redefined how we package and ship products in our industry.

	                              so thanks for the intern welcome                               everyone I honestly wasn't expecting                               people that thought with that title like                               metaphors we compute by my name is                               alvaro as he said I come from all the                               way I lived like three years in China                               where we used to make one of the biggest                               dating sites from Germany I cannot say                               the word because I pretty sure it                                violated across conduct later I moved to                                Switzerland for a living in Zurich until                                today I mean I still live there I'm not                                quitting suit and ya used to work at                                RabbitMQ I was called developer did a                                lot of things there then moved to Apple                                and now I'm working at a Swiss company                                called Negros Oh me grow as the Swiss                                like to call it and it's like a big                                supermarket chain and everything the                                candy machine that happens in                                Switzerland one way or another is touch                                by me grow anyway this talk metaphors we                                compute why it's hard to explain but                                let's get into it the year were let's                                say the literature linguistics                                philosophic philosophy world change was                                when George Lakoff and Marty Johnson                                they published book metaphors we live                                dying                                anybody here has read the book show your                                hands you did it the whole room why I am                                amazed nobody knows this book roof the                                main thesis of all Lakoff is that                                metaphors they are not just like matter                                of poetry or rhetorical flourish like                                you use them to explain things and or to                                make your points more beautiful or your                                prose better no that's not the the main                                thing why we have metaphors they say                                they permeate all of language and                                furthermore they dictate in a way how we                                live how we see the world based outcomes                                from the                                metaphors so they say how we think how                                we behave how we perceive reality how                                our conceptual system is built all these                                things is what they say is affected by                                metaphors and you can say I don't                                believe you or show me an example                                because I am really already thinking                                about going to the next talk and they                                give the first example is argument is                                war we understand argument using a war                                metaphor and just to name some ways we                                speak about arguments if your claims are                                indefensible the italics is a metaphor                                he attached every weak point in my                                argument I demolished his argument I                                never won an argument with him his                                criticisms were right on target                                bla bla bla la la what's the point here                                it's like because we see argument as war                                this is how we understand argument and                                this is how we argue with each other but                                they say oh they asked what will happen                                if I go meant was dance like we have to                                collaborate with each other we have to                                try to give you some steps I do some                                other steps then this thing evolves in a                                beautiful way what if we think that way                                instead of this trying to destroy the                                other person we try to to actually work                                together to to find pieces of truth                                because if you claim you have the whole                                truth I mean who are you just talk to me                                after because you're a special person so                                you could say I'm not convinced okay                                let's talk about what everybody likes to                                talk politics I know it's a very hot                                topic but just think about in in Europe                                if you think about the metaphor of the                                himat land and all what makes me I don't                                know German Italian Spanish Swiss or                                whatever and all these metaphors around                                that country then you see all the flu                                killing or or was a word for flu                                cleaning is the refugees and you don't                                want them in your country that                                we one way of thing metaphors are                                telling me what I need to think about                                these people or I don't like them or                                whatever                                I'm South American let's think about how                                the Europeans thought about the native                                people there all these salaries that we                                can kill enslave and do whatever we want                                with them because we don't think them as                                people and that is in history in the                                world all over the place one different                                 metaphor and then we see something in a                                 complete different way disabled person                                 versus a person with different abilities                                 or however you want to call it all these                                 wars matter in one way or another you                                 still not convinced maybe human resource                                 management if you think that people are                                 resources you will just think as a                                 manager that you can just replace                                 developers bring somebody else because                                 it's just a resource I need to optimize                                 the resource usage all these resources                                 are not giving me the output I need so                                 if you work around this metaphor of                                 resources then what are you doing with                                 your humans and we are not resources we                                 are people and we have many things that                                 make our lives and our jobs happier or                                 or not happy but don't treat developers                                 like their shows resources but that's                                 just another metaphor the getting to                                 your thoughts then to your warning there                                 has been lot of discussions about a                                 conference in the functional programming                                 world where people are telling that this                                 conference is giving a platform to                                 racist people to go and speak they                                 publish a blog post explaining their                                 view this conference about why they were                                 inviting this racism to their stage our                                 mission is even here and the key here is                                 the word wrestling if you are wrestling                                 with inclusion are you sure you are                                 trying to get together with that that's                                 how you see these things I don't know                                 think about it i that word came                                 jump to me when I saw in that particular                                 blog post but anyway let's talk about                                 computers computers another metaphor you                                 probably have seen the movie read the                                 book I don't know have you seen the                                 hidden figures same yeah go these women                                 they were the actual computers so even                                 our industry started from a big metaphor                                 we had these people usually women that                                 they were all doing all these very fast                                 calculations for for for the engineers                                 and because we had this machine that                                 kinda could do the same thing but                                 automatically how do we call them                                 computers because we have no other word                                 and metaphors are always used to explain                                 things from one area of knowledge into                                 another one we try to use them to                                 transfer knowledge because the metaphors                                 they enable understanding we have a word                                 to name something versus having nothing                                 and having to plain everything from                                 scratch but we have to be careful of                                 what we understand as a metaphor or what                                 we expect from the metaphor one of the                                 probably most famous one in literature                                 is the Shakespeare's when he says or                                 Romeo says that Juliet is like the Sun I                                 guess you probably understand that he                                 saying that without Juliet his life has                                 no meaning or he will die because this                                 the energy of his life his life is all                                 going around Juliet and everything that                                 probably the sentiment to a                                              person but you cannot say that a                                 metaphor is a one-to-one mapping between                                 concepts because Jack still never said                                 that Juliet gave me a skin cancer it's                                 not what Romeo is thinking about this                                 lover he has so we have to be careful                                 because sometimes people is the problem                                 with metaphors it's like when you use                                 it just you saying this thing I'm sorry                                 I don't have an example right now people                                 like to argue in the Internet and they                                 would say yeah but that's not real                                 because these people is not doing this                                 under London and then destroy the whole                                 metaphor because there is no not a                                 one-to-one mapping here for sure that's                                 the whole point you see some patterns                                 and you put them together so there is                                 another book by a researcher from the                                 Netherlands I think Viktor garden force                                 which is called the geometry of meaning                                 semantics based on conceptual spaces if                                 you don't have a weird title I think you                                 are not an academic I'm not sure how it                                 works but in a place they mention Lakoff                                 and they say that metaphorical mappings                                 preserve the cognitive topology of the                                 source domain in a way consistent with                                 the inherent structure of the target                                 domain you see things that are together                                 that are like they match and then you                                 use a metaphor to explain that other                                 concept this a computer is not a woman                                 just sorry if I use the word woman for                                 the early computers like in the movie                                 hidden figures the computer is not this                                 person just doing calculations it's just                                 the calculation part that I want take as                                 an example to explain what this machine                                 that I just built that is full of cables                                 and nobody understand what is it's doing                                 that we should spend a lot of budget                                 building it let's say government                                       and I need to explain you what is doing                                 okay you see all this room full of                                 computers we just replace it with this                                 thing here are cool here's your check                                 that's easier to explain but it doesn't                                 mean that the computer are you telling                                 me that the computer has to go to the                                 toilet and run all across campus no I'm                                 not saying that so again we need to know                                 what to transfer from one place to                                 another so they say metaphors transfer                                 information from one conceptual domain                                 to another and what is transfer is a                                 pattern rather than domain-specific                                 information again is not the computer                                 going to the toilet                                 a metaphor then they say can thus be                                 used to identify a structure in a domain                                 that would not have been discovered                                 otherwise and I will have plenty of                                 examples with this and they say this is                                 how metaphors create new knowledge when                                 you maybe are very confused about trying                                 to explain something then you have the                                 right metaphor you have the you                                 understand what that problem is but                                 another problem is that metaphors also                                 obscure understanding a good example is                                 the Telegraph Telegraph means far                                 writing right so but in the                                              when it's they were inventing the                                 Telegraph these are writing machine they                                 didn't understand that they didn't have                                 to really write at a distance so so                                 machines they were trying to build they                                 were actually going to have a thing kind                                 of right at somewhere like some                                 prototypes they they grow up and do                                 that's not going to work it's just we                                 had also the arrival of Brian the system                                 for for blind people's of Zurich and                                 then they say okay but maybe we can                                 encode the way we transfer language and                                 then this other guy came and say oh but                                 he also is like I have this code with                                 Morse code then okay let's try to                                 optimize the things you have here we can                                 also use language in color like Bryleigh                                 so then we don't need to really write at                                 a distance we can do it but not really                                 do it and then you have the modern                                 Telegraph but if you just get attached                                 to that metaphor is not going to work so                                 again careful there's a really good good                                 book by Nicholas Carr called the                                 shallows was the influence the Internet                                 is swinging to our minds he said                                 basically that we are becoming shallow                                 people and they say sometimes our tools                                 do what we tell them to other times we                                 adapt ourselves to our tools                                 requirements                                 and we can say that metaphors are the                                 tools of thought so we are always                                 adapting to whatever metaphor we have if                                 just try to go through history hope we                                 explain the functioning of the working                                 of the mind in the early or the body in                                 the times I think of the Greeks it was                                 like fluids and things then it was more                                 like this clock that they developed in                                 Europe and you have everything is like a                                 clockwork a machine working and all                                 these pieces putting together and then                                 we got the computers which actually the                                 original value were people then we have                                 the actual machines and our brain is                                 like a computer computing information so                                 depending on the top tech of the time is                                 what we used to parse or interpret or                                 ring so then we have metaphors and                                 actual code have you ever heard about                                 this paper what a parameters yes                                 everybody in the room call this paper if                                 from the archive of Donald Knuth at some                                 point it was a project to scan the                                 papers that he has in the library so you                                 can find from letters he wrote to                                 Dijkstra to this thing to like a manual                                 written by Corey the guy the cool guy on                                 how to program for the army the whole                                 manual in the                                     he was already teaching them to program                                 secret stuff then we was reclassified                                 and this on the notes archive there's a                                 lot of stuff this I will say is the best                                 unknown paper is from                                                it's full of pearls on how to be a good                                 programmer how to manage a team in a way                                 and a lot of things that are really                                 interesting what problem they were                                 having back then that are completely                                 happening today and I don't know what's                                 the name of this person because Newt                                 doesn't know it the person that gave the                                 paper to new chosen knowledge so it's                                 new doesn't know something is really                                 unknown I guess it's news I don't know                                 and they say they say to program is to                                 write to another programmer about our                                 solution to a problem so when we program                                 we yeah we are solving a problem that                                 somebody's paying us to do but at the                                 same time either disordered programming                                 is asked in the future or some colleague                                 we are telling them look for that thing                                 that happened this is how we solved it                                 we use this data structure this                                 algorithm bla bla bla and that's our                                 solution that's or metaphor of what that                                 thing up there is this thing here stands                                 for the solution to that other thing and                                 this sentence is a bit mixed but they                                 say no one has seen a program which the                                 machine could not comprehend but which                                 humans did if we try to parse it we if                                 we have a program which they think that                                 is correct                                 doesn't matter what you wrote the                                 computer will be able to parse it                                 compile it and run it the thing is who                                 is the actual target of that code who                                 for who are we writing code if you work                                 in a team you're writing for your future                                 self and your colleagues you are not                                 writing so the computers compile it and                                 run it and yeah that's for sure will                                 happen sooner or later when when the                                 text editor you use shows you that there                                 are no syntax error that will wouldn't                                 be a problem for a computer but we need                                 to understand that there is a                                 programming is a human activity between                                 humans                                 besides the computers that happen to be                                 the tools that today we have to run                                 those programs in a fast way but that's                                 just a tool there so when we write                                 programs we can say that types are the                                 characters that tell the story of our                                 programs and in this case I'm not                                 talking about let's have a religious                                 site of a scale versus closure or I                                 don't care what we all know that Allah                                 is better anyway                                 and you see max did say space is not                                 that gay new clinics not gene you                                 linoleic anyway the types of me I mean                                 is the actual from this paper while                                 Barbara Liskov called program iam with                                 abstract data types                                 back in the                                                             had to actually convince people that you                                 cool or you should write using                                 attraction because the function the                                 wrapping calling a function and calling                                 that procedure that was like their                                 revolution in that time so she had to                                 ride you like gear but this thing you                                 are doing is a stack call it a stand                                 write an API for it and is fine or you                                 are just pushing putting stuff into a                                 queue or whatever but use a data                                 structure and she wrote here she has his                                 paper and then she has an actual book                                 where she's playing the whole theory and                                 by the way she also teaches unit testing                                 in that book from the                                                  all stuffs new stuff anyway one thing to                                 understand is that without types we just                                 have operations on stream of light who                                 I'll give or what is giving meaning to                                 the program just whatever type you you                                 name that thing but otherwise is just                                 bite and just ramming bite like von                                 Neumann used to say if you really need                                 this machine code like assembler what                                 are you're not a real programmer that                                 was a von Neumann way of seeing running                                 like you should need to you bite the                                 things you know download those lumps on                                 and off and one thing that we have to be                                 clear is that choosing the right data                                 structure is very important and you can                                 say yeah whatever but just think about                                 this you want to keep data let's say                                 you're the users in your app use an                                 array an array                                 perfectly fine to put stuff into it but                                 I tell you in the requirement that you                                 cannot have duplicated users then why                                 don't you use a set because when I use a                                 set data structure I'm telling the order                                 Paramus I mean forget about all the                                 obvious thing that we know said whatever                                 is the fastest implementation in Java I                                 don't care which language but the set                                 idea if you know a bit about math from                                 secondary school you know what it                                 involves to be a set and to have a set                                 so when I read your code and this thing                                 storing users it's a set                                 I also matically know even if I don't                                 read the original spec document that the                                 users cannot be duplicated that's one                                 bit of information he'll there or if I                                 use a linked list I know how the data                                 can be accessed or if I use a cue I know                                 the order in which items could be                                 retrieved or stuck so I say that a                                 program explanatory power is a measure                                 of its own elegance if you don't it is                                 hard to explain your program you have                                 all the fancy tricks cool it's fast cool                                 not sure it's easy for other people to                                 understand what you try to do what was                                 the solution you are trying to                                 communicate I don't know if even talks                                 from Martin Thomson like the performance                                 expert in Java mostly less and he said                                 that well refactor code is a code that                                 usually is easier to observe or                                 compilers so it's not an excuse that I                                 yeah but I did all these little tricks                                 here because I wanted to write fast code                                 did you really benchmark it to know that                                 single quotes are affecting your users                                 versus double quote or I don't care one                                 may be nice a programmer Trivium right                                 there Lee just proposed a book to                                 O'Reilly oh no this parameter trivia so                                 as I said all these data structures they                                 have explanatory power and there is a                                 reason why we should use some versus the                                 others                                 besides that when we use the right                                 metaphors we can have chronic cognitive                                 leap just think about task scheduling                                 where I want let's say to write the to                                 execute tasks based on the order they                                 arriving to the system so the first task                                 to arrive has to be the first one being                                 executed                                 they all have to wait shut up it's just                                 queueing theory I mean what you're                                 trying to do is to use a queue yeah it's                                 very obvious but when you have a queue                                 you have queueing theory you have all                                 the stories all the theory from along                                 the telco guy not they learn the                                 language the Danish guy and you have all                                 the mathematical power of queueing                                 theory to analyze the performance of                                 your application or whatever you did a                                 cognitive leap and you were using or we                                 were using all these words to say in                                 order in this thing that we need a queue                                 and the story everybody understand what                                 is a queue you've been at the                                 supermarket airport post office whatever                                 so you know what that is                                 yeah when I get there if possible with                                 not so much traffic and have a nice view                                 and bla bla bla bla' graph theory graph                                 theory okay                                 and when you wince or once you                                 understand that your problem is a graph                                 problem that does the metaphor that                                 explains your power your problem you                                 have the whole power for a theory for                                 you right there you will know even if                                 it's a problem that has a solution                                 doesn't have a solution maybe I don't                                 know in that theory you will have the                                 explanation then on the database                                 replication community this is really I                                 think the most interesting of all of                                 them there was a paper talking about                                 rumor mongering basically spreading                                 rumors and they wanted to replicate data                                 but spreading rumors they call that                                 gossip and gossip this and I tell my                                 information to these two nodes and these                                 two nodes to three other nodes and bla                                 bla bla bla bla very nice but then while                                 they were writing the paper they                                 realized that data was actually being                                 replicated in the same way that an                                 appeal                                 Amyx is doing they have a different                                 metaphor which was epidemics and then                                 they found this paper the mathematical                                 theory of epidemics from the                                             mathematics you need to know on how to                                 stop an epidemic an epidemic but they                                 say we need the opposite we need to                                 spread it faster that's what they want                                 to do with data replication and they                                 have all this math for free so we can                                 say that we can have a problem if we                                 find the right way to explain it it's                                 cognitive leap that will take us further                                 further away so everything is a metaphor                                 I don't believe you you might say the                                 tribute assistant metaphors                                 whenever nodes need to agree on a common                                 value we start consensus algorithms to                                 decide on a value there's usually a                                 leader process that takes care of making                                 the final decision based on vote                                 received from peers bla bla bla bla bla                                 all these books about metaphors you can                                 find a political speech by whoever in                                 the United States full of metaphors the                                 weather reporting the UK full of                                 metaphors the political landscape                                 landscape actually reflected us weather                                 metaphors a storm is coming for the                                 whatever party and blah blah blah I                                 don't know critics rained on them after                                 the I don't care                                 just pick a book do that exercise you                                 will see they're everywhere so I don't                                 know why I have yeah I have more                                 metaphor sorry not communicate sending                                 messages over a channel which might get                                 congested due to too much traffic there                                 is a disco create and information                                 bottleneck with queues at each end of                                 the channels breaking up all metaphors I                                 assume some of them I didn't even put it                                 on italics you say yeah but this is mega                                 obvious everybody's talking like this                                 today yeah but                                 do you know that when messages were                                 trying to be sent by the early                                 Telegraph's                                 people were worried that the package                                 they bring to the post to the telegraph                                 place was not so or like the letter sent                                 this letter to my nephew in Zurich and                                 and then but the letter is still there                                 in your desk what are you doing people                                 were complaining Sinclair that because                                 they didn't understand the metaphor of                                 what was being used in the actual                                 telegraph some buzz kills so it is not                                 so easy sometimes to see what they mean                                 by exactly what finally last one this                                 bottlenecks might render one or more                                 nodes and responsive causing network                                 partitions is the process that taking                                 too long to respond ed we won't know                                 unless we set a timeout whatever                                 so metaphors everywhere Intermezzo this                                 part may sound random probably but this                                 talk was given as a package in                                 conference so I had to talk about text                                 and besides go ahead ten minutes one                                 question is like don't be the seesaw                                 seller that is trying to sell the next                                 package where I need a scissor to to                                 open it and you can understand that for                                 example GHC the Haskell compiler if you                                 don't ask chef Haskell you can compile                                 Haskell so what GLC is required to build                                 GHC because plc itself is written blood                                 I don't care so but why are we here now                                 this because I think the whole packaging                                 and container metaphor is was or has                                 been has proven to be very successful                                 because everybody wherever you go is                                 talking about containers and they are                                 very easy to explain you can do your                                 elevator pitch in about talking about                                 containers and because we understand                                 these things we see them crossing with                                 trains trucks ships whatever                                 they have like a standard way of being                                 built they can be shipped anywhere                                 trying ships trucks whatever they are                                 stackable reusable but do we wait till a                                 ship is full of containers until the                                 ship is actually ship somewhere else no                                 we don't we took the best part of the                                 container metaphor we use it we throw it                                 there and we have startups around it and                                 if you want your next million-dollar                                 idea do you know what is that they                                 highly di diving bell Holly the guy that                                 from the comment he had a startup where                                 he was recovering with this bill where                                 he could go and dive down in the ocean                                 recovering wreckage from containers so                                 once all this container industries are                                 crashing up maybe we need a highly kind                                 of diving bell company trying to migrate                                 people away from whatever container                                 thing we are using today I don't know                                 might happen and probably will happen                                 because that what the industry is always                                 recycling itself so heady come here                                 similar is with micro services we got we                                 have all these things thrown up there                                 decentralized governance                                 monalee we see this thing that we don't                                 like versus micro services small I can                                 handle it                                 isolation collaboration small is better                                 bigger is cumbersome that means vessels                                 goliad which I understand those things I                                 want to be the small guy between the big                                 guy da la la all these metaphor that                                 people use to sell us micro services all                                 the things like bring this power to the                                 developer with micro services and they                                 will make you a king and if you read all                                 the blog posts from the original micro                                 services blog post my question was as an                                 Ellen developer this is just LR and the                                 last literally last footnote on the blog                                 watt says in another direction one color                                 you that micro servers are the same                                 thing as the Yellow Emperor amine model                                 but applied to an enterprise application                                 context so you can say yeah okay yeah                                 Lanka I complaining about Alana being                                 successful micro services being                                 successful that's not the point                                 my question is what a long elevator                                 pitch killing children like baby like                                 these commands in a leg and I don't care                                 what how do you explain a lung on an                                 elevator to a manager you had a person                                 selling things how do you go and sell a                                 line there are no metaphor that you can                                 employ while if you are selling                                 micro-services you have all these other                                 things that I should mention so you                                 think we shouldn't care about language                                 you think we is not important to learn                                 what we do so to finish master the art                                 of metaphor selection first get people                                 to understand things then we can explai                                 how things actually work an example I                                 was given or used to give lots of talk                                 about rabbitmq and people always ask me                                 is rabbit a job server and say no it's                                 not a job server because you had                                 messages and a message is a better                                 abstraction that the job because a                                 message could be a job but the message                                 will be an alert an event bla bla bla                                 chillax man and this job server is a                                 perfectly understandable metaphor for                                 many developers okay you understand                                 already yeah you wanna use it cool once                                 you get there and are doing it then                                 let's get into the finer details but                                 sometimes this metaphor is more than                                 enough sadly it is a new with back then                                 so master the art of meaning                                 amplification again we are programming                                 for people we are not programming for                                 for ourselves maybe your holy project at                                 home I don't know and our program is a                                 metaphor for the solution we found if                                 people can understand that was a great                                 program otherwise I'm not so sure                                 references those are some of the books I                                 read and                                                            images and thank you very much                                 [Applause]                                 [Music]                                 thanks Oliver we have plenty of time for                                 questions does anyone have a question                                 one question you forgot dropping packets                                 on the floor as a metaphor yes any other                                 metaphor or questions and I saw I think                                 it was mailing list about from Drupal or                                 someone was asking let's change the                                 terminology in our software because it                                 talks about masters and slaves and it's                                 very uncomfortable giving history of                                 slavery and well this turned into a very                                 big discussion and in the end they                                 decided we're not going to change it                                 because even though the suggestion to                                 change it into primary replicas makes                                 sense and it's nicer and everybody                                 already knows what the master slave and                                 database system is and people don't have                                 this conversation anymore because it's                                 clear right master and slave and if you                                 change it then people have to learn new                                 things and that's why we stick to what                                 we already know and does it make sense                                 just to say because yeah we keep the                                 terminology that we know and the meaning                                 will change as we use it for me in this                                 particular example it doesn't make sense                                 to keep the master slave terminology                                 because if for some people they have                                 this past where they were actually                                 slaves or maybe it is just a mother or                                 the grandfather in the United States for                                 example and I'm not I'm not I'm not sure                                 they're slaves even today they're people                                 we've involved brought as slaves in                                 Europe my wife actually is helping a                                 charity in Switzerland where I think if                                 I'm not mistaken with a hundred bucks                                 you can buy five people in the north of                                 Africa I'm not sure if it's Libya or                                 whatever and they managed to free these                                 five persons doing that so I'm not sure                                 it's something that is from the past and                                 I personally have no problem with                                 whatever new terminology somebody                                 chooses to use I don't have a really                                 good example that came to mind right now                                 but I don't think I think we have been                                 wrong in the way we spoke and different                                 places different words across history                                 and there is no reason to not change                                 that I don't see why not                                 so do you think it's possible to replace                                 one terminology with another one and get                                 everyone changing too many words for the                                 same thing about the particular flame                                 work I don't know and I'm not part of                                 the Drupal community to say something if                                 it comes up I have no problem with that                                 but I mean with the change                                 so the problem in that particular                                 example was that a white man said that                                 we should keep the terminology for                                 backwards accountability here for people                                 that is backwards probably they need to                                 be compatible to that kind of                                 terminology I guess but I don't know so                                 everything is a metaphor so I suppose                                 the standard library is also a metaphor                                 and a few years ago there was a pretty                                 heated discussion in the scholar                                 community about what should be included                                 in the standard library and that became                                 pretty crazy I think it was specifically                                 should the JSON serialization bit should                                 be part of the standard library and then                                 it was a argument about semantics                                 basically so we have a suggestion for a                                 better name for the standard library or                                 something like that and I have no idea I                                 haven't told about it I don't know                                 honestly I don't know thank you for the                                 great talk first of all and that's one                                 metaphor that is haunting the whole                                 water right now and comes from the                                 hunting yeah and it's coming from the                                 software world and it's everything that                                 is related to machine learning and                                 intelligence and neural networks that                                 for historical reason bring some awesome                                 similarities to our brain but when the                                 media took our metaphors away from our                                 context and you know much machine                                 learning of search in the                                             and this metaphor became quite dangerous                                 because people began to believe that                                 these systems these algorithms could                                 take life and conscience and attack us                                 and destroy the world and this is the                                 current narrative                                 in most of the mainstream media or at                                 least part of it it depends on the mood                                 of the journalist at that moment and                                 there's a small movement advocating                                 against the use of these metaphors at                                 least in our tech environment I don't                                 know have you ever told to including                                 you're told something about what happens                                 when these metaphors leak in the oil                                 water and non-techies take them up and                                 you I don't know they panic or whatever                                 I think the problem happens in all areas                                 not just in from tech to we take                                 metaphor from other places and and                                 misuse them I guess another concept that                                 for me could be next talk I was                                 yesterday discussing with a frenemies                                 here in in at the conference Umberto Eco                                 talks about the has a book called Lecter                                 in Sabula which is basically how they                                 also builds the reader in a way and how                                 they also never can Excel what the                                 reader is and he has a concept of the                                 encyclopedia which is what you have in                                 your mind based on what you read what                                 are your experiences where you come from                                 whatever that whenever you read the book                                 you bring life to all these words so                                 what are these other people                                 encyclopedias and whatnot probably not                                 the same as ours or developers let's say                                 programmers techies geek I don't know                                 and it's really hard it's a bring that                                 once you write something that thing is                                 out there whether it's documentation for                                 code or or a book on a novel let's say                                 so that's why we have to be very careful                                 on on all these things because at some                                 point somebody misinterpret something                                 and it scales let's say so yeah I don't                                 know an answer for data but this                                 encyclopedia constant form is very                                 important on how we bring meaning to                                 words based on our own experiences                                 unfortunately we're out of time I'm sure                                 there a lot of other great questions                                 feel free to chat with Alvaro afterwards                                 let's give them a hand                                 Thanks                                 [Applause]
