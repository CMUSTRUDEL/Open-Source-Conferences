Description: 
	Viewed in a broader social construct, is free software a movement or should it be? Using free software means making a political and social choice. However, that is not always a choice that is available for everyone. Karen analyses the role of free software and questions if it is just a convenience for the privileged or an essentiality.

	                              hi everyone my name is Karen Sandler I                               am the executive director of the                               software freedom Conservancy which I                               will talk about in a little bit I'm a                               lawyer but I usually only give legal                               advice for free mostly to charity and I                               am super into free and open source                               software and I've been thinking about                               the role of free and open source                                software for a while and it's been a                                very interesting year which has caused                                me to do a lot of self-reflection about                                the role of free and open source                                software in society and I'm going to                                take you through sort of my my journey                                over the last year                                these are my twitter handles so if you                                are looking at your phone or other                                device I know it's because you're                                tweeting so keep it up thank you I know                                you're going to

can get where I'm coming from in my                                analysis about open source and free                                software this is a picture of where I                                went to university it's called the                                Cooper Union raise your hand if you've                                heard of the Cooper Union nobody oh one                                person two people great                                if the Cooper Union is a University in                                the United States                                it's a tiny school it's about a thousand                                people including grad students and it                                was founded on the principle that                                education should be free which in the                                United States was a really revolutionary                                concept so for a long time the Cooper                                Union was the only free University in                                the United States and it only had                                degrees and art architecture and                                engineering and I went there for                                engineering I effectively split                                Electrical and Mechanical Engineering                                but the most there were quite a lot of                                formative things about going there one                                was a in a growing up in a country where                                we're going to university had a lot of                                the trappings as being very wealthy the                                fact that there was a school where it                                was full scholarship for anyone who                                was a completely different model and                                pretty cool and I showed up on my first                                day and sat in my C and Fortran class up                                until that time I had only programmed in                                basic and I show up to my C and Fortran                                class and they say you know because I'm                                old they say you got to go to the                                computer center to get your account                                because nobody had their own computer so                                I go into the computer center to get the                                account and there were no women in the                                computer center it was full but there                                were no women and I went with a friend                                who I had just made in the class and we                                looked around and it was really weird                                because it was a very uncomfortable                                culture for us there was even a guy who                                had ASCII porn on his screen which was                                very innovative at the time so but but                                she just left my friend and she said                                I'll just come back later right and I                                was at the time sort of thought well                                this is such old news that there would                                be any kind of sexism in a technical                                environment please were so beyond that                                now so I went and marched into the head                                of the computer centers office and I                                said you got to do something about the                                situation here because there are no                                women hanging out and it feels weird and                                he said what's her name and I told him                                and he said you're hired and I said what                                do you mean and so what they did is they                                had they had this people called computer                                center operators who were white lab                                coats and walked around the room and                                helped people with their work and so I                                became one of those people and he tapped                                that the most you know the the most                                advanced people in the computer center                                to help me and he said get her root as                                soon as possible and and so that was                                sort of like a crash course for me and                                that was my first introduction to free                                and open source software I mean instead                                of in addition to using some of the                                stuff that you know GCC is like a lot of                                the software that you would have used                                 anyway in that academic program we                                 installed a new Linux lab                                 I remember thinking boy this free                                 software idea this Linux thing is pretty                                 cool it's too bad it won't last                                 and so I went off and went to law school                                 and didn't really think about much about                                 about technology and ethics again I                                 didn't think about free and open source                                 software for sure these are pictures                                 that I actually took from my my law                                 office in New York so these are views                                 from my desk of my my paperwork and text                                 that's a deal book and my my suit jacket                                 and the view from my office which is at                                 the Chrysler Building which was and I                                 totally immersed myself entirely in                                 financial law in like debt and like                                 doing bonds and and I even did some some                                 IPO work and I I just I did that for a                                 while and it was it was really                                 interesting but I was so far away from                                 technology and and then I started                                 getting involved in it's a much longer                                 story oh no I just got an error message                                 leave our office I love you but you                                 crash during my presentation but as a                                 former executive director of the kinome                                 foundation it may it's tough to know                                 what the                                 uh-huh this is very exciting                                 okay here we go okay whew sorry if it                                 happens again when I was executive                                 director of the genome Foundation this                                 was always my my biggest nightmare was                                 economic I was going to have some issue                                 during a presentation and I was always                                 super smug when all the people using you                                 know windows and and Apple like MacBooks                                 and and Apple products would present and                                 they would have problems and I would say                                 to have a private Airy software it's                                 just so unreliable                                 so luckily this and it didn't happen is                                 it so so I for a long story short I want                                 to doing pro bono legal work for doing                                 legal work for free and open source                                 software project and using that                                 corporate financial background in order                                 to help them with their help them with                                 with their challenges plot the poem                                 foundation for example was one of my                                 first clients and I help them get their                                 tax exemption status in the United                                 States and part of that was describing                                 why free and open-source software should                                 be charitable because we had to accept                                 the German charitable system is quite                                 similar I've been through it with some                                 of the German organizations not as a                                 lawyer since I'm only admitted in the                                 United States but as just a general                                 participant and you explain why it                                 should be treated charitably and so I                                 was doing that for for free and open                                 source software projects I was I thought                                 that open source was cool I thought that                                 that it was really useful and I had kind                                 of a culture clash when I came in coming                                 from the securities law world wondering                                 sort of like are these people for real                                 my clients were passionate about                                 software freedom they're passionate                                 about free and open source software and                                 explaining why it should be charitable                                 you know why should be treated like you                                 know life like an organization that that                                 helps people recover from disasters or                                 helps children that helps people that                                 are destitute and and I sort of it took                                 me a little while to sort of figure out                                 like you know how to explain that and                                 how to believe it it was interesting is                                 that my the clients I was representing                                 were just so passionate and I didn't you                                 know and it was interesting also because                                 some of my clients were really copyleft                                 people and like you know like the free                                 software foundation and people who were                                 really GPL Pro GPL and then some of my                                 clients were like the BSD s who were                                 ideologically opposed to copyleft and                                 thought that it was a different idea of                                 freedom and over time I sort of I came                                 on board                                 you know I they convinced me through                                 their work that what they were doing was                                 important and I started to see the                                 broader societal impact of it but still                                 I really just was someone who thought                                 that open-source was cool I thought it                                 was useful but I was on the fence really                                 about whether or not you know how                                 fundamental this issue was was it you                                 know is was all this talk about freedom                                 like an overstatement right people who                                 are worrying about software freedom are                                 often people who aren't worrying about                                 where their next meal is coming from and                                 so you know where where is the                                 perspective and where is the line and                                 and then I discovered that I had a                                 medical condition so I literally have a                                 big heart my heart is the three times                                 the size of a normal person's heart and                                 I'm asymptomatic but or mostly                                 asymptomatic but I'm at a very high risk                                 of suddenly dying the doctors actually                                 call it sudden death is a technical                                 medical phrase which is really weird but                                 the doctor the cardiologist sort of told                                 me you know you're fine as long as you                                 know you're at a high risk of sudden                                 suddenly dying it's                                                  compounding                                 and I was                                                                a condition so the chances of dying in                                 the next decade were extremely high and                                 they said that that it was okay because                                 all I would need to do was to get this                                 defibrillator implanted in my body and                                 if I got that then if I went into sudden                                 death the device would be there any                                 which shocked me and everything would be                                 okay                                 uh-huh and when you go to the                                 electrophysiologist office for something                                 like this                                 they keep sample devices in their desks                                 so there are extremely expensive devices                                 I know because in the United States of                                 course our health insurance our health                                 care system is really crazy and so you                                 get a bill for for everything even if                                 you have good insurance you get the bill                                 a report for what your insurance is                                 covered and my defibrillator was so                                 expensive there actually I think are a                                 little cheaper in Europe but because                                 it's what the you know there's it's                                 market driven but so in the                                 electrophysiologist office they have the                                 little devices and they have them in                                 their desk drawers and so when you need                                 one what they do is they let you hold                                 them there's like they say the guy but                                 electrophysiologist slipped my device                                 across the desk and he was sort of                                 looking at me expectantly my mother was                                 there you know for support and they both                                 like kind of look at me as I hold this                                 little device and then he's looking at                                 me like see it's not so scary it's a                                 small device and and I look at him and I                                 say what does it run and he said run and                                 I said yeah run my this device has                                 software on it                                 software is vulnerable this is very                                 close to what I do I spent a lot of time                                 thinking about the ethics of software                                 and can you tell me anything about it                                 and he said software the guy implanted                                 sometimes multiple devices in a day                                 thousands of devices and it had never                                 occurred to him that there was software                                 on these devices that he was putting in                                 people's bodies and he said but he was a                                 good guy he said no worries don't worry                                 about this because you're in luck today                                 in the in the office right now is the                                 representative                                 was Medtronic and so he'll know                                 everything that you need to know and so                                 and so he calls in Tom and Tom comes in                                 and he looks at Tom and he says this                                 woman is asked really interesting                                 questions about the defibrillator she's                                 asking what does it run and Tom says run                                 and I say yeah there's software on the                                 device yada yada                                 he says software and then he said don't                                 worry about it because you couldn't call                                 the this hotline this technical hotline                                 and they'll tell you everything you need                                 to know so I called the hotline and I                                 was put in a phone tree abyss and I                                 eventually realized that that I was                                 going to need to get the device and I                                 couldn't put it off so I got the device                                 but I launched a research project oh so                                 I got the device I forgot this this                                 front slide of how I became a cyborg                                 with proprietary software literally sewn                                 into my body and screwed into my heart                                 and suddenly the issues that I was                                 researching and thinking about in the                                 context of free and open source software                                 and charitable activities became                                 significantly less abstract and much                                 more real suddenly my life relied on                                 this and it seemed really important and                                 like once I got over the whole idea of                                 becoming a cyborg and having you know                                 medical implants and things like that I                                 started to embrace the fact that I was                                 unique and that I would have a really                                 different perspective on these issues so                                 I launched a research program into the                                 safety and efficacy of these devices and                                 what I found will not surprise most of                                 you in the room which is that the                                 devices are totally vulnerable there's                                 most of them almost all of them are                                 broadcasting wirelessly via radio                                 telemetry and there is no real security                                 on them at all we have the worst of both                                 worlds we have closed and proprietary                                 software that can't be reviewed when we                                 know that free and open source software                                 is safer over time not all free software                                 is better or safer but it stands a                                 chance we can fix problems when they                                 happen etc so                                 launching this this program I also did                                 research into the Food and Drug                                 Administration in the United States and                                 most of the other countries that I                                 researched are the same where where the                                 the agency that's approving these                                 devices is also not reviewing the                                 software so not only is the software                                 vulnerable to attack and has been shown                                 to be exploitable in the cases of many                                 medical implanted medical devices but                                 because we're not the our governmental                                 agencies they're not even asking for                                 copies of the source code there's no                                 public repository there's there's no                                 recourse in the instance that that my                                 device starts to fail ER has a really                                 fundamental problem if there's                                 catastrophic failure at Medtronic or at                                 any of the other made of major medical                                 devices all the patients who have those                                 devices have to get them removed                                 basically so if the device manufacturer                                 is not so inclined to fix it so that's                                 sort of how I became passionate about                                 free and open source software the first                                 time and I became really involved                                 because when it's your life it suddenly                                 becomes a much bigger deal it the issues                                 became stark reality for me it was it                                 was so clear that that that this was a                                 problem that that needed to be addressed                                 and and while it's quite dramatic to                                 talk about my heart condition in this                                 way it's a metaphor for all the software                                 we rely on right while we have an                                 Internet of Things where all of our                                 software is talking to everything else                                 we're only as safe as our weakest link                                 when researchers want to show that cars                                 are vulnerable to attack they don't go                                 right to the ignition system or the                                 brake system they usually get in through                                 the entertainment system or the wheel                                 maintenance system so all of our                                 software that we are all of our critical                                 software that we rely on for our lives                                 in our society need to be free and                                 open-source software we need to know                                 that if if there is a big fundamental                                 problem that we can fix it but but we                                 don't even know which of our software is                                 going to be                                 life and society critical so it's very                                 difficult to know where to draw a line                                 and so I co-founded the software freedom                                 Conservancy we are an umbrella                                 organization to help prepare to help                                 free software projects that are                                 alternatives to proprietary software to                                 succeed this is a list of all of our                                 it's a recent most of our member                                 projects but we've added coreboot since                                 then and closure community but but as                                 you can see we have git and sambal                                 whining scape we've got over                                             and including outreach e which is a                                 diversity program for women and people                                 of color were underrepresented in tech                                 in the u.s. although the rest of the                                 program is is global and and so I've                                 been plugging away at this for a long                                 time and working on this we also are                                 known for for being the home of the                                 coalition of of Linux kernel developers                                 who want to have their their license                                 enforce their copyrights so we funded                                 the lawsuit that Christophe Hal was                                 brought against VMware some people are                                 nodding so we're known for defending the                                 GPL and I've been plugging along like                                 this very righteously self-righteously                                 very confident in my choices very                                 confident in my in my preaching about                                 the importance of free and open-source                                 software and how fundamental it is the                                 the research all points to free and                                 open-source software being better and                                 safer over time we all know the utility                                 for a commercial enterprise it was just                                 a matter of getting the word out and                                 being the right kind of evangelistic                                 about it right but then the world sort                                 of started to change in ways that                                 surprised me I thought I knew what was                                 happening in the world I thought that I                                 had a good idea of where things were                                 going I think a lot of people did but we                                 I realized that I was kind of living in                                 a bubble and that I didn't necessarily                                 see the full red eye like many others                                 this is from the                                 near times but it's interesting how how                                 comparable a lot of the brexit and the                                 u.s. election themes were kind of                                 similar so in addition to starting to                                 read Fox News every day in addition to                                 the New York Times which I've done since                                 then leading up to the u.s. election                                 I've just sort of realized that that                                 there are that that I needed to revisit                                 a lot of my basic assumptions about what                                 I thought was obviously true and what I                                 thought was clearly going to happen and                                 any idea that you're passionate about                                 anything that you think is so important                                 and so right should be able to survive a                                 really strict criticism and analysis and                                 so I decided that I had to start from                                 first principles again and so when I                                 spoke to the buzz words organizers about                                 this about this talk it was we started                                 we started talking about speaking on the                                 phone in I think even October or                                 November before the u.s. election post                                 brexit and and then when we actually                                 spoke on the phone it was right after                                 the US election and I was sort of like I                                 don't know what I'm going to talk about                                 because I don't know if I'm even going                                 to think that free software is so                                 important come June that's a long ways                                 away and I really you know a lot of my                                 friends in who were real free and open                                 source software activists we're saying                                 you know actually I really realized that                                 that I only want to work on encryption                                 or realize that I only want to work on                                 things that relate to the current                                 political climate and and similarly a                                 lot of donations that people were making                                 to the small free software charities we                                 were all getting emails saying actually                                 we're going to donate to the ACLU this                                 year instead of your free software                                 charities because we think this II you                                 know I want my money to have the most                                 impact and I think these issues                                 are really important and and I thought                                 you know fair enough like it is it                                 really so important am i spending my                                 time in the right place to be talking                                 about free and open source software when                                 in order to get to the point to even                                 care about free and open source software                                 so many things have to go right already                                 you know there are so many causes that                                 are so fundamental that need a lot of                                 attention should anyone even care at all                                 about free open source software and it                                 was the talk was talking about what I                                 would say at a conference like this that                                 caused me to go through this really full                                 analysis of whether or not what I had                                 previously saw it was in fact right and                                 so I started by coming up with sort of                                 some basic principles as to why I cared                                 about freedom on source software and                                 what we were doing a Conservancy that I                                 thought was so important that I would                                 ask people to open their wallets to                                 something that they might not think was                                 the particular cause for them at the                                 time and and I should hasten to note                                 that that I I didn't have a political                                 agenda with this it's just that the                                 shift of conversation globally from the                                 shift of conversation within Technology                                 communities away from from a lot of the                                 the basic presumptions and the basic                                 conversation that we had been having in                                 the past moved regardless of where on                                 the political spectrum you are it was a                                 you know time time to reevaluate and so                                 one of the things that was clear about                                 what what Conservancy and software                                 freedom has to offer is the defense of                                 our core technology a lot of our                                 remember projects of Conservancy are                                 infrastructure projects like it you know                                 like they're things that people are                                 using tools and other basic basic pieces                                 of technology and if we don't if we                                 don't safeguard that if we don't make                                 sure that if there are problems we can                                 fix them then we're going to be in                                 trouble in the long run I I kept                                 thinking about the Volkswagen situation                                 where Volkswagen                                 with hiding its it's the missions                                 information from its cars deliberately                                 and I kept thinking about the engineers                                 who were working there who knew that                                 they were is anybody here working at                                 Volkswagen just using AC people laughing                                 over there so that's what we do have a                                 Volkswagen employee or former employee                                 in the audience oh and I saw an ability                                 I thought about you I thought about the                                 engineers who or the technical                                 technological like technologists who                                 were working there who may have known                                 that this was happening and couldn't                                 couldn't you know raise it like raise                                 the attention level and how terrible                                 that must have felt you know and and how                                 well meaning that we as technologists                                 are generally or how we assume that or                                 how we hope that our technology we use                                 for good now I this is a statue of an                                 iron ring because I had forgotten all                                 about this but the very guy who who I                                 spoke to the very man who ran the                                 computer center at the Cooper Union who                                 started me off entirely on seriously on                                 programming and on computers computing                                 in general he had been have been                                 familiar with this thing called the                                 order of the engineer raise your hand if                                 you know what the order of the engineer                                 is nobody okay                                 it's a Canadian focusing so it's not                                 that surprising but I thought someone                                 would have heard of it it is a it is a                                 like a an ethical Society of Engineers                                 and so when I was in college and it's                                 it's a very big deal in Canada but only                                 a few universities in the United States                                 and and Europe subscribe to it or have                                 brought it over to them and so you can                                 tell that someone's in the order of the                                 engineer because you they have an iron                                 ring on the they're the pinky finger of                                 their working hand so if you see someone                                 with a with a very simple ring on their                                 pinky finger you know that they're                                 probably in the order of the engineer                                 and the order is Anja near that the                                 metal that the rings were originally                                 made from were from a bridge in Canada                                 that had collapsed and it was a reminder                                 that the technology that we work on as                                 engineers and I was an engineering                                 school can fail and that we should                                 always remember that we have a                                 responsibility to society because the                                 choices we make as engineers and as                                 technologists have far-flung                                 applications they have they could they                                 could impact a lot of people so this is                                 the this is the oath I took that I and I                                 totally forgot all about it                                 I did it when I was you know                                            never thought about it again until I                                 started thinking about these issues for                                 Berlin buzzwords actually and I suddenly                                 remembered that I took an oath that                                 actually I had pledged to practice                                 integrity fair dealing tolerance and                                 respect and that my skill carries with                                 it an obligation to serve humanity and                                 it's so interesting it recognizes the                                 idea that we as engineers and                                 technologists have special knowledge we                                 have superpowers and we have to use                                 those superpowers for good because we                                 have information that other people don't                                 and if we are not cognizant of the ways                                 in which our technology can fail we're                                 going to be in trouble now this is a                                 huge deal in Canada which is really cool                                 because everybody goes to engineering                                 school gets sworn into the order of the                                 engineer and the night before they do                                 that                                 it's like prank night because it's the                                 very last time that you can ethically do                                 a prank because otherwise once your                                 joint and I join the order of the                                 engineer at you've sworn not to and so                                 this is like a bunch of engineering                                 schools in quite a few of them in in                                 Canada have sculptures of the iron of                                 the Ring and the order of the engineer                                 and this is one where they took that                                 statue as part of the prank and made it                                 an occupy mortar statue because there                                 should be one ranked why not rule them                                 all here's what this the small Sciences                                 and it's so like you know if you're if                                 you hear of like a lot of of pranks that                                 sometimes engineering people do or they                                 put cows down the rooms and things like                                 that sometimes there before the square                                 the order of the engineer because after                                 that you can't conduct pranks because                                 you are sworn to behave ethically and so                                 I was thinking about this and how this                                 influenced my my thoughts about freeing                                 up and source software and I thought                                 that that's a very idea of tying in the                                 responsibilities of engineers and                                 technologists to technology is not                                 something that I have heard in any other                                 context and with the world that we're                                 with the world that we're in right now                                 technology is underlying everything                                 technology is you know software it                                 touches everything that we do it touches                                 the way we communicate with people it                                 touches the way we create anything it                                 touches our the way that we you know the                                 way that we create anything and the way                                 we solve problems and we are entrusting                                 most of that technology to single                                 companies that may or may not have our                                 interests at heart an example of this is                                 that my my defibrillator shocked me                                 twice when I was pregnant                                 my heart was doing what normal pregnant                                 woman's heart hearts do about more than                                                                                                    palpitations and my heart was                                 palpitating in a way that it would                                 normally do for some pregnant women but                                 because I had a defibrillator I got                                 shots twice and now I promise you that I                                 had a Medtronic device at the time I                                 promise you that Medtronic did not want                                 pregnant patients to get shocked                                 literally the last thing that Medtronic                                 would want would be for pregnant women                                 to get shocked                                 but nonetheless I wasn't a use case that                                 they were attuned to only                                             than                                                                   to patients younger than                                           number of n there are many more men with                                 these devices and women for a variety of                                 reasons that could be a whole other talk                                 but but the chances the set the sample                                 set of pregnant women who have                                 defibrillators is quite small so it's                                 just not a use case that they were                                 focused on and I can't I can't blame                                 them for it but I had no access to the                                 software in my body I couldn't ask                                 Medtronic I asked the tronic for the                                 source                                 but they wouldn't give it to me nor                                 would any of the other major                                 manufacturers and I couldn't even look                                 at it to see if I could you know submit                                 a patch for my own situation and so the                                 way that we solved it was by giving me                                 medication to slow my heart rate down so                                 that so that I wouldn't be shocked not                                 because my heart rate needed to be                                 slowed down I couldn't even walk up a                                 flight of stairs it was so intense but                                 only to prevent my device from giving me                                 unnecessary treatment and this stood for                                 the proposition that we might not the                                 companies that are entrusted with these                                 roles may be very well intentioned they                                 may have the best intentions they may be                                 the most ethically run company ever                                 there might be plenty of executives who                                 would walk out if the company did                                 anything the slightest bit untoward but                                 they can't anticipate every situation                                 and so we can't rely on single companies                                 in order to to protect ourselves this is                                 just a picture of a cat protecting a                                 fish store sort of like you know who do                                 we want in charge of our technology                                 probably people whose incentives are                                 aligned with the public's and where                                 these lines are tough transparency is a                                 huge part of bringing open source                                 software and one of the main things that                                 I argue for when it comes to my own                                 medical condition but all software that                                 we rely on we need to make sure that we                                 have the ability to to take a look at                                 our software and find out what's going                                 on with it and to determine if we're                                 being surveilled you know run run tests                                 make it open to scrutiny but most                                 importantly of having the source code in                                 the event of catastrophic failure and                                 being able to fix those problems when                                 they arise looking at the looking at the                                 the state of global politics and                                 particularly in my own country I can say                                 that that after the u.s. election I got                                 my first personally targeted hate tweet                                 which was interesting most of my threats                                 previously has been                                 had been either in in comments or in                                 private email not publicly and so and so                                 what I was what I've seen is in what                                 what a lot of articles are written is                                 that there there's a little bit more                                 hate that's visible in our society and                                 making sure that we have inclusive                                 communities is really important and                                 that's one thing that that Conservancy                                 is working on through our outreach the                                 internship program but it's one thing                                 that is should be totally fundamental to                                 software freedom right something that                                 should be a part of free and open-source                                 software should be the the access that                                 it gives to everyone when we have                                 software freedom we make this first code                                 available anyone can see it and so I you                                 know I think once people have access to                                 their to their technology it's                                 empowering and democratizing and it                                 means that that anyone can pick it up                                 and run with it they can translate it to                                 their own languages they can they can                                 they can do what they want with it and                                 so even though we're we're failing a                                 little bit in terms of making sure our                                 communities are are diverse and and we                                 can see that just when we look around it                                 almost any of our conferences they look                                 pretty homogeneous the fundamental ideas                                 behind software freedom are ones that                                 are about inclusiveness and about making                                 sure that that anyone can have access to                                 their technology and make a difference                                 with it and I think that's that's really                                 important and I think the the main thing                                 is that what I really I have to tell you                                 I'm going to be honest with you                                 it was really touch and go for me for a                                 long time with ally devoting my life to                                 the right cause am I wasting my time I                                 mean I'm working for a non-profit and                                 struggling right it's so hard to make a                                 charity go you know I mean um raise your                                 hand if you give if you donate to a                                 charity somewhere any of them so that's                                 like like half of the audience raise                                 your hand if you donate to more than two                                 so that's only that's                                 it could work that's a lot of people                                 it's like                                                               than I expected it to be but but most of                                 us pick a charity at most and donate to                                 that and we don't you know and it's so                                 so running a charity that is maybe not                                 the biggest name on the on the block for                                 a Cause that is less immediate is sort                                 of like you know it's such hard work                                 it's such a struggle we run                                 conservancies for people and and we run                                 the nonprofit for over                                                  projects we do GPL enforcement we have a                                 tremendous amount of bookkeeping                                 administrative work and we're also we                                 have no marketers on staff we're the                                 ones who have to explain why this is                                 important we're the ones doing a blog                                 post where the runtime I'm the one                                 packing t-shirts when we have people                                 sign up as supporter so if anyone here                                 is waiting for their t-shirt I'm really                                 sorry but but it's so much so much hard                                 work and I'm not a lawyer and an                                 engineer and making an non profit salary                                 and working all the time on this cause                                 is it the right thing to do does it make                                 sense and for a little while there I                                 really wasn't so sure but but in working                                 through it and thinking about it over                                 the last the last six months or so I've                                 realized that that this is a long-term                                 issue right the the state of our basic                                 infrastructure is it's critical and it's                                 not necessarily something that's going                                 to formulate today but today we're                                 making choices that will affect us for a                                 very long time today we're building                                 products in corporations and together                                 generally where we're relying on                                 commercial clothes proprietary software                                 for fundamental things and that's going                                 to come bite us and I think it's looking                                 at the study is it seems pretty pretty                                 clear that we're going to have some                                 major disasters we have major disasters                                 if all the software were free and                                 open-source but at least when those                                 disasters happened we'd have something                                 to do about it                                 right with with proprietary software                                 we're just relying on a company to first                                 admit there's a problem and then do                                 something about it we're relying on them                                 to be able to get enough money                                 through through their business model                                 through financing through VC through                                 whatever means that they have to make                                 sure that they care about our situation                                 and they may not even be attuned to it                                 like in the case of my defibrillator and                                 we can't simply be scrambling when                                 things go wrong we have to make good                                 sound infrastructure decisions now and                                 so last night I was talking to Christian                                 and and he said with big data comes big                                 responsibility and I think that's a                                 hundred percent right especially in data                                 where you know there are a lot of issues                                 I'm not saying that free and open source                                 software is the only issue we could talk                                 a long time about open data we could                                 talk about a whole variety of ethical                                 issues around it but making sure that                                 our software is free and open-source is                                 a cornerstone it's an essential first                                 step what we know from free and open                                 source software and this is the thing                                 that that has pulled me around entirely                                 is that the entire ethos of it being                                 free and open-source software is that we                                 acknowledge that we haven't quite gotten                                 it right yet that we know we can always                                 improve what we're doing and that we                                 know that our basic sub positions and                                 assumptions can always be questioned and                                 that is the fundamental idea what it is                                 to participate in a free and open-source                                 software community and we should apply                                 that to everything because we can't take                                 fundamental things for granted we know                                 that we won't be perfect we know that we                                 can always improve and for me that's                                 quite personal but it should be for you                                 too because about three million people                                 in the world have medical have                                 pacemakers that's not even including                                 insulin pumps or all the other implanted                                 devices and every year                                             implanted so if we're all lucky enough                                 we'll all become cyborgs we don't even                                 know what kind of technology that's                                 going to be and how it will interface                                 with everything else that we're using we                                 won't know what the critical                                 infrastructure is for our own bodies and                                 for the fundamental things of our                                 society and so I encourage you to think                                 about using free and open source                                 software for all of your fundamental                                 choices because it is about the future                                 that we're going to build so concerned                                 with is charity I                                 I don't want to be socially is to say if                                 you donate to a charity it should be                                 conservative but but think about if you                                 have any disposable income think about                                 donating to some of the charities in our                                 space we're working on the issues that                                 are going to be really a big deal in                                                                                                            technical knowledge and the                                 responsibility and the foresight to help                                 these initiatives get going so that we                                 know that we're looking after our future                                 thank you it's time for questions so we                                 have some time for questions you can ask                                 about anything you can ask oh there's                                 one other ah do I update the firmware on                                 my defibrillator yeah if I wanted to                                 patch it so right now the the way that                                 the that these defibrillators work is                                 almost all of them have a wireless                                 component and you get them the                                 terminology in this field is so                                 hilarious so when you have a device the                                 medical companies have they're like have                                 their computers that they use to                                 interface with the devices and those are                                 called programmers and they interrogate                                 the device I feel like I would have                                 picked a different term but okay so they                                 interrogated so so I was lucky enough to                                 get my first defibrillator was an old                                 device and and I found I finally found a                                 lecture physiologist who got what I was                                 talking about and he he found one of the                                 last sterile defibrillators that had no                                 had didn't have the radio telemetry in                                 it and so the device that I had before                                 you could only talk to you with magnetic                                 you know it says magnetic coupling and                                 so and so my device had been updated                                 many times using the using the so called                                 programmer but in order for someone to                                 use that they have to be right on your                                 chest like it's right has to be right                                 next to the device and I recently less                                 than three weeks ago got a new device so                                 I'm a little a little                                 still recovering from but but and this                                 is the only device available in the                                 United States that can have the radio                                 telemetry switched off there was only                                 one device I could find so I want the                                 ability to patch my device but I want to                                 be able to control who accesses my                                 device right now these devices have no                                 real security on them not even password                                 protection on them and they are                                 broadcasting the programmers are                                 designed to interact with them                                 wirelessly from when I go to the                                 electrophysiologist they tell me that                                 that they can still see the                                 defibrillators of the people who have                                 been in their offices they can still see                                 them until they're completely out of a                                 building so you can and and there have                                 been researchers who white hat hackers                                 who have shown that you can control a                                 tick you know exploited defibrillator                                 and deliver a fatal shock or an insulin                                 pump a lethal dose using an iPhone in a                                 public place so I want the ability to                                 update my software I wanted the ability                                 to patch it but I also want to be able                                 to control who accesses this technology                                 right I want real security I want real                                 security and free and open source                                 software                                 I don't want not just anyone to be able                                 to patch my device I want to be able to                                 hire medical professionals I want to be                                 able to organize all of the pregnant                                 women with defibrillators to get                                 together to fund the you know                                 development on a patch so that all of                                 the pregnant women that have palpitating                                 hearts don't get shots in the future                                 right and I don't I don't know how I                                 don't have access to the source code so                                 I can't determine that for myself right                                 now but whether that's for even feasible                                 but I would like to be able to know and                                 right now that's simply not the case                                 so there it's funny because I think                                 people are often put off by my argument                                  because they're saying you're you know                                  your your your your loss all perspective                                  if you think that that that we should be                                  giving patients access to their devices                                  and I'm saying I want access to the                                  source code but I want real encryption                                  real security on my device I as compared                                  to open source software do Co                                  benefit or radio see free software is                                  there difference or do you prefer one of                                  them over the other a free software                                  versus open source software sure I think                                  as long as we're talking about freedom I                                  don't mind so much I have to admit you                                  that so when I was new to the field I                                  got taken in quickly by people who                                  insisted that we needed to say free                                  software and never open source software                                  because we were somehow I might say                                  taken it but I was convinced really fast                                  that the that I needed to only say free                                  software if I wanted to signal to people                                  that I cared about freedom and then over                                  the years I felt like more people knew                                  the term open source and I felt like I                                  was losing people by just saying free                                  software and so then I became quite                                  adamant and I don't think I'm                                  overstepping here to say that I argued                                  with Richard Stallman many times over                                  over when I would say free and open                                  source software and he would say just                                  use free software and and then I would                                  explain why I felt like that was                                  inadequate and and then now like then                                  over the course of the years I realized                                  that I was kind of I was kind of                                  suckered by the by the the                                  business-friendly open source                                  enthusiasts who made a lot of the                                  freedom advocates feel like talking                                  about freedom at all was alienating to                                  business and what difference did it make                                  how we refer to it and so so for a                                  little while there I was contemplating                                  using only the term open source because                                  that's what people talk about and people                                  you know the word open source words open                                  source had one but if you said open                                  source you knew that you would have the                                  right to modify and distribute those                                  modifications right it like there's                                  there it wouldn't really be open source                                  if you if it was just you know both                                  terms free and open or inadequate or a                                  free base it sound like it's free as in                                  price and and open just makes it sound                                  like you can look at it but it doesn't                                  mean that you could do anything with it                                  when you see it so but now I have to say                                  that so then I sort of started feeling                                  like you know actually I've been a                                  little bit tricked because it was true                                  that we had we had accommodated the                                  commercial sale of free and open source                                  software such that                                  lot of developers felt for a while like                                  they couldn't even suggest copyleft as a                                  license without being left out of the                                  room but all the things had changed HP e                                  ela Packard enterprises like a year and                                  a half ago maybe two years ago had an                                  announcement like a that the gplv                                       their preferred license and martin sink                                  their CTO got up on stage and talked                                  about why the GPL was so much better for                                  business and how we'll be paying for the                                  same permissive infrastructure over and                                  over again all the same governance                                  around permissively license or lacks                                  license or dismissive lis license                                  depending on how you want to call it                                  licenses if if we don't start going back                                  to copy left a little bit so I think as                                  long as we're talking about the same                                  thing I don't mind it so much but I                                  would say that that free and open source                                  software is is something where we have                                  to keep the ideology closed no matter                                  how we talk about it we have to think                                  about the society societal implications                                  the balance of power that we have with                                  free and open source software is                                  delicate and especially in the areas                                  that all of you are active in that would                                  bring you here companies have gone away                                  from copyleft                                  and and that means that it's a lot                                  harder to keep control keep keep your                                  software fully in the public and make                                  sure that we can protect against some of                                  the you know copyleft is just one                                  strategy for dealing with Isis I don't                                  care what licenses my software is under                                  if as long as I have active as long as I                                  have the freedoms connected to it and                                  licensing is just one way to accomplish                                  that there are other ways but but copy                                  less did keep the balance of power and                                  martin fink described it is like                                  swinging the pendulum back in the other                                  direction and I think we've seen we've                                  seen some of that and it'll be                                  interesting to see where it goes do you                                  get access to the data that comes off                                  with a fib relator                                  and do you know who else gets it oh my                                  gosh so this is a huge issue that and                                  and what's funny is so I started                                  speaking about this and then there was a                                  I knew about learning about a man who is                                  just a few years older than me who had                                  the very same condition as me and we                                  found out about each other because I was                                  I was interviewed by NPR the same week                                  that he gave a TED talk and people were                                  like and we both                                  had the same hypertrophic cardiomyopathy                                  our dispute and we both have                                  defibrillators and where we were talking                                  about two sides of the same coin so his                                  name is Chico campus and he's working on                                  getting access to all of his data and                                  this is incredibly important and                                  something that's really really difficult                                  to do so the device manufacturers do                                  collect a lot of data about it and I                                  worry a lot about when I recently got my                                  defibrillator out I requested to keep it                                  I should have brought it actually                                  because now I have like I could hold it                                  out of me like this thing was in my body                                  but I also was able to get the data file                                  off of it                                  so I'm curious to see what I can what I                                  can find from that but but the the the                                  it's very hard to know to answer the                                  second part of your question who is                                  getting access to the data because                                  theoretically it's simply the medical                                  device manufacturer in your doctor's                                  office and there are strict laws in most                                  countries that I'm aware of for handling                                  that but there was a recent study that                                  was published where researchers were                                  able to by the programmers in the                                  aftermarket off of ebay and one of the                                  devices had like thousands of patients                                  data like patients worth of data on it                                  had like their condition and their                                  doctor's name and they're like all of                                  their their history and information from                                  their devices and there are procedures                                  and hospitals for for dealing with                                  wiping these devices before they get rid                                  of them                                  and so I I think that the controlling                                  this data says that it's only held by                                  people who should have it while at the                                  same time giving rights to patients is a                                  huge problem there's a new really                                  there's like a whole movement around                                  patient empowerment and I'm really been                                  happy to to get apart to become a part                                  of that because as these devices become                                  cheaper and more people have them more                                  technologically savvy people have access                                  to them and then we can we can really                                  get access to them this is especially                                  relevant the insulin pump space there's                                  like a nice Scout Foundation or that                                  we're not waiting movement where people                                  have reverse-engineered their insulin                                  pumps so they can                                  more precisely deliver their own insulin                                  so they make themselves artificial                                  pancreas and having access to your data                                  is totally critical to this and and it's                                  a really important piece of the puzzle I                                  can't see if we're out of those someone                                  has a question down here I don't know                                  we're out of time we're totally out of                                  time I'll be around all day so feel free                                  to find me thank you so much and enjoy                                  the rest of your conference and thank                                  the organizers if you see them maybe                                  even give them a high-five thanks
