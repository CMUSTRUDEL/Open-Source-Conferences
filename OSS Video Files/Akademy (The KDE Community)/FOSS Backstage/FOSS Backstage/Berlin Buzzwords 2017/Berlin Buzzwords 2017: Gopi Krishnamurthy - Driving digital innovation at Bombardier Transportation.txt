	                              hello everyone my name is Gopi Krishna                               moti                               with bombardier transportation                               I joined Bombardier a couple of years                               back in                                                     transformation initiative where the                               company was taking a new turn towards                               how they want to structure is and how                               they want to bring their products so                                primarily I will focus today are more on                                how our digitalization journey takes                                place and how we are more focusing on                                self-service data analytics yeah and                                that that will be our depart to                                self-service cat analyticity and that                                will be the core of my speech there will                                be slight there are which are a little                                bit technical but I will not go into the                                technical details assuming this talk is                                more for intermediate audience but if                                you have some questions feel free to                                have it and at the end if there is time                                we can talk about it or I'm available                                outside you can we can make we can make                                a short talk on it because let's start                                with who are we so I think most of you                                know bombardier transportation so in                                short we make train sir                                that's a cool job right yeah of course                                yeah and our sister company makes                                flights or planes so that's even cooler                                but is it still cool yeah in this age I                                think people expect more from from the                                industry yeah so yes                                it's like it's a cool job but at the end                                the end customers at the moment are                                looking beyond what we call for as a                                traditional manufacturing yeah so it's                                no longer that you produce a traditional                                rolling stock or a train or a you bar                                but people are now looking at the                                next-gen transportation and this is                                basically our our transformation journey                                so how do we go ahead with our next                                generation transportation yeah so this                                is a very high-level advertisement slide                                for my company so we provide the                                broadest portfolio in rail industry not                                only in Europe but also across the globe                                there is a triple handle as well as the                                sights there are a lot of opportunities                                available those who are interested                                please go to our sites and look for for                                them                                so so we start with who are we and where                                are we moving to and how so where are we                                moving to so we are moving to giving                                customer Next Generation X Generation                                travel experience what does this mean                                that this means that you are always                                connected you get the modern-day apps in                                your in your mobile and you are always                                connected with the high-speed Internet                                of course everybody were focus is about                                safety and capacity which gives us more                                profitability but at the same time we                                also have to focus on innovation yeah if                                you want to compete in this industry as                                you see already that there is a big cake                                over from or not just ago was also a                                consolidation in this industry taking                                place from our Asian and competitors as                                well oh so and how so this is basically                                my talk about so we are planning to                                utilize the big data stack basically to                                bring in creative analytics and data                                science so focus on this speech would be                                more about two use cases one on the                                technical ability how we bring in our                                our big data stack and how self-service                                is important and how certain security                                and the compliance requirements made us                                to think about self-service and not just                                depend on the core IT back-end systems                                and the second use case would be more                                about data science lab where I talk                                about a business problem and how we were                                able to handle this of course there is                                from the manufacturing side we have to                                go for a smart automation which is not                                covered by but this is this this needs                                some foundational foundational                                capabilities to be enabled by our big                                data and predictive analytics TAC at the                                same time we're also partnering with the                                internal and external customers                                basically the startups to bring in some                                next-gen apps that could be integrated                                to our train systems and also we work we                                 are we plan to work with the                                 universities there are some talks going                                 on which I will probably show in our                                 next                                 so what does it mean to us so let's                                 start start with what does it mean to                                 our trains so basically we want to                                 provide big data capabilities and also                                 give us an open API so do our customers                                 and partners for example Netflix can can                                 connect to our platform and then based                                 on this user who is traveling will get                                 ok you were seeing last hour you are of                                                                                                        your favorite sitcom and basically you                                 can it gives you the suggestions and you                                 can go ahead with viewing it during the                                 period of journey that you have of                                 course this means there is needs to be                                 an next gen next generation networks and                                 there needs to be some kind of an                                 analytics that needs to be done for our                                 trains and then of course we have data                                 science so the ones that are highlighted                                 is Big Data and data science just to                                 showcase that I'm not going to touch the                                 other parts now although some of the                                 slides will will have these captions                                 embedded in them                                 the second is what it means to our                                 productivity so the here we talk about                                 industry                                                             know sensors and robotics have already                                 been integral part yeah but not in case                                 of traditional train manufacturing                                 systems so basically how to use robotics                                 to automate our shop floor activities                                 and finally paperless and lean factories                                 and what does this mean to IT so because                                 I am from the IT department which we now                                 call it as digitalization department or                                 program where we talk about mobility so                                 how to bring in mobile apps and how to                                 make it paperless and serve so and more                                 self-service how to loop in it although                                 it says ask platforms it's not just us                                 but how to bring in the next gen cloud                                 platforms enabled for our for our                                 applications and also about eLearning                                 so this is the accelerator program that                                 I talked about so basically we are at                                 the moment working with our                                 working with a couple of startup to do                                 some kind of predictive analytics on                                 cash flow the idle urban design trio are                                 various my transport is basically and                                                                                                          I                                 what's the parking facilities available                                 what's my transportation options can I                                 rent a car can I go the public transport                                 so that kind of information that it                                 gives now so this is still in in in                                 proposal let's say that's why I say we                                 we are still in in our radar so nothing                                 is find yet but we are looking forward                                 to work with them so anyone interested                                 from startups can also reach our site is                                 mentioned here or you can reach me and I                                 can connect to the corresponding program                                 heads if you have a cool idea that would                                 also help us to take us to the next                                 generation okay so enough of this so                                 let's say let's go into the use case so                                 what can you take from this short speech                                 so it's a                                                            already used more or less ten minutes                                 here so basically I want to start with a                                 very very simple use case where how                                 self-service analytics actually helped                                 us our self-service data preparation and                                 data wrangling data and blending helped                                 us to enable our data Lake and the                                 second use case is more about a business                                 problem that we will talk about and how                                 self-service and enabled to bring                                 solutions faster so let's start with the                                 data Lake so this is our conceptual                                 architecture so we have our trains which                                 is basically getting all the information                                 what we call it a system of records from                                 this we try to get this both from                                 on-prem or what we call as wayside which                                 is basically coming from the trains or                                 the tracks is getting ingested into our                                 data like platform and this is basically                                 fed into an experimentation of product                                 prototyping environment what we call as                                 data science lab so here we develop                                 models we check if this works and what                                 kind of business value does it bring is                                 it                                 is it good enough to in displace it now                                 so that it goes back to our system of                                 record and and produces a value to our                                 value chain so very very small kind of                                 Alexei Mickey Mouse diagram to just show                                 our high level conceptual architecture                                 in terms of layers so this is how it                                 looks so we we have a base from from                                 untrim to our data like platform it's                                 going to there is going to be enjoying                                 just an layer and then followed by a                                 storage as any of architectural                                 principles that we also tried to                                 separate our storage from processing                                 that's why we have it storage and sub                                 processing separately and followed by an                                 inside layer yeah so what does the                                 technical stack look like so we used all                                 tricks and Python to prepare the data                                 before ingestion and why we will see                                 this in the next slide s                                              storage layer and then comes the                                 processing basically redshift and EMR so                                 strictly speaking like shift is not                                 decoupled from storage although we                                 primarily focus here more about using                                 redshift as an analytical data base and                                 EMR is our SD Hadoop stack so basically                                 we are our our our principle is that we                                 don't build anything we always try to                                 buy because that's not our core business                                 so we build trains are not software so                                 we always go for anything that comes out                                 of the box and finally we have a stack                                 for for inside where again we try to use                                 all tricks on tableau which is basically                                 a self-service for business as well as                                 technical users and then we have a                                 machine learning primarily focusing on                                 our data science lab environment used by                                 data engineers and data scientist so why                                 why did we go for a preparation before                                 ingestion so last year when we started                                 the our couple of years when we started                                 the initiative we made for a lot of                                 pilots and then we decided we go with                                 AWS as our core platform although we                                 didn't we didn't put aside all the                                 others                                 but it start of this year when                                 everything was ready there was a press                                 release that we are going live with our                                 data light environment and we will go                                 with a pilot for our connected trains we                                 had a kind of a road block which states                                 which comes always from security and                                 compliance right so this is always the                                 case not that this is wrong but this is                                 an awakening call for us just four weeks                                 before Gola we were so told that we had                                 to have some kind of and compliance we                                 need to follow compliance on data                                 masking and a non-elimination of                                 personal data so this comes from both                                 workers consul point of view because we                                 cannot have personal data of employees                                 there which means that there will be                                 some kind of a                                                          of employees which is strictly opposing                                 what workers council from workers                                 Thomson point of view which was not our                                 intention as well yeah and the same                                 comes from the you data privacy which is                                 not yet in life but it will come in                                      so we already was forward-looking okay                                 how to make sure that these data privacy                                 requirements are or handled before being                                 just data into our data like of course                                 strictly confidential data as is key for                                 our customers as well as for our                                 business we cannot let anything go away                                 from buy to get get hacked by our and                                 lose our so-called proprietary designs                                 and models so of course we have to do                                 for strictly confidential data must be                                 client-side encrypted and how the core                                 is not about the technical problem of                                 how to encrypt or how to how to arrive                                 or how to meet them but how to take how                                 to make it much more how to make it much                                 more transparent for the customers in                                 this case the customer is to be a                                 representative from the workers Council                                 or it could be a representative from                                 legal and data privacy departments or it                                 could be just in any or any end-user                                 within the company so how to make this                                 transparent so that v from central IT                                 don't get bogged down by this that                                 everyone comes to us and says ok now can                                 you give me this audit trail or can you                                 now give me                                 this audit logs so we don't want to get                                 bucked on with this because we want to                                 proceed with providing the next layers                                 and next upgrading our stack so how to                                 make this much more giving it to the                                 end-users like a self-service and this                                 is this is key for us so on the left                                 side is more the technical side which I                                 say as I said I will not talk about we                                 already saw the block diagrams which                                 talked about the storage computation                                 layers but I focus more on the right                                 side basically we have a governance                                 structure all handled by ultrix which                                 basically goes into a secure server                                 database and sharepoint which sits on                                 our untrim so what is the reason because                                 we want to make sure that any data                                 before it goes into cloud is audited and                                 stored in our governance framework and                                 this is basically we have a data like                                 client API so but that's basically                                 written in Python which basically                                 consumes this from at the end of the                                 arctic's workflow then we take this data                                 and put into our injection layer so what                                 do we do here the framework is basically                                 saying capturing what is the data what                                 is requested by the customer what is the                                 assessment in Vonage the assessment what                                 is the classification of this data is                                 data owners have have they approved who                                 need to get access to this how do we                                 integrate this with our metadata                                 management classifications of our                                 catalog management how do we compress                                 upload and all this catalog of                                 information needs to be somehow managed                                 and and that can be readable later or                                 can be auditable later when someone                                 needs to go through this and of course                                 then it should also be scalable so that                                 it's we now start with a very very                                 limited scope of data which is basically                                 coming from our wayside but once we                                 start integrating our core systems like                                 citizen on on from then we need to be                                 able to scale this also as well and                                 that's that's the core of it what is the                                 key takeaway so with with the data                                 preparation tool what we were able to do                                 is we were able to get an into and                                 artist raishin of the process so that                                 all of this what we said can be all                                 bundled together we could easily track                                 them at any point if someone comes and                                 says okay what was the data that was                                 moved in last                                                   confidentiality it was easy to provide a                                 report not by a central IT but someone                                 from the core business or from the                                 complaints as well moving on to the                                 second so basically this use case is                                 more about business problem so we have a                                 problem there we we know what is the                                 overstock in stores and we also know                                 what what we deliver to the customer but                                 this is a typical manufacturing problem                                 that once your stock moves into your                                 production line there is no clear                                 visibility so people are always running                                 around the chasing blindfolded because                                 they have no no clue ok what is being                                 now in which production line what is my                                 cost that is trapped before that is not                                 being delivered to our customer so this                                 is key because what we found this                                        our cost was tracked in this production                                 line and this is a big risk for us when                                 it comes to our cash flow so we had a                                 typical problem there is nothing new so                                 we had data quality issues we had                                 multiple year P systems we had more than                                 one standard processes we had greater                                 granularity issues in our BW we could                                 not do cleaning of data and people and                                 business we're more looking for an agile                                 and fast spending solution are or else                                 they want to just put in Excel and                                 deliver some report which is degree but                                 it's not the reports that our president                                 wanted to see so what did we do so this                                 is a kind of a lab environment so it's                                 not a disliked industrialized solution                                 so as in the previous talk someone                                 mentioned so this is more for our                                 scientists to work with yeah so we take                                 the Corre ERP systems we tied up we we                                 kind of do a data preparation and                                 wrangling an enrichment using all tricks                                 they also did develop some kind of and                                 core models using our but then this                                 could be imported into Alex to run the                                 end-to-end workflows                                 and finally we have to also enrich it                                 with some master data because once it                                 goes back to the business then they need                                 to be able to see it in their language                                 yeah and then we visualized reports in                                 in tableau so this is the let's say the                                 overarching solution that we had in                                 place but I go into three cases just to                                 show what has what was done so the first                                 is very simple flow where we in any                                 company this is the case that is master                                 data is not harmonized it's not                                 maintained in our core ERP systems there                                 is no standards and in case of bombarda                                 this is our this was obvious because we                                 as a company grew by acquisitions so                                 there were always more than one company                                 behind the core labeled company so what                                 does this mean so we had to run                                 different workflows and to bring all                                 this data into a kind of lab environment                                 to to harmonize them and this                                 organization could be done if it was                                 self-service by the business themselves                                 and not depend on the IT the second                                 problem again typical problem in any                                 manufacturing side so we have a cost                                 allocation problem                                 so from Finance point of view this was                                 never a problem because finance always                                 had a different model for to calculate                                 this which was sitting in a BW and they                                 were not focused on the granular data                                 yeah but from operational point of view                                 this is this was very very important to                                 calculate certain KPI yeah so for                                 example what is the amount of what was                                 the amount that was spent in painting or                                 repainting this kind of information does                                 not come from financier so basically we                                 need to go to a level where the data is                                 maintained in the core si P cables I                                 don't know how many of you know some                                 tables like like material movement or m                                 cig which basically has like millions or                                 sometimes even billions of rows yeah so                                 we have to go to this tables to to to to                                 see how the costs are assigned to to a                                 certain product and in cases where we                                 could not directly assign them we have                                 to reassign them we have to create                                 models to reassign them and this models                                 differ depending on the business                                 departments so this is another key so                                 where we could design a model and then                                 give it back to the business                                 who could just put them some kind of                                 input and output processing parameters                                 thresholds and then say okay this is the                                 optimized cost allocation that we could                                 get to the finally we had another core                                 problem with the building and hierarchy                                 this so this is any company any                                 manufacturing or product this company                                 will have a bill of material what is                                 basically saying okay how does your                                 product break down or breakdown                                 structure and sometimes this structure                                 was not available when you are producing                                 this goods internally so basically if                                 you have a what we call as a build and                                 axles it is produced internally but                                 there is no bill of material because                                 it's just a wheel but at the end it has                                 to be also produced so that someone has                                 to know how this is done and in such                                 cases we have to build our own hierarchy                                 to which is basically coming from                                 material movements again millions of                                 millions of rows so why I highlighted                                 all this is if the same has to be done                                 in a traditional VI VW there was an                                 entire dependency on our core IT which                                 would probably take months or even years                                 to implement this as a project but we                                 were not interested in like an hundred                                 was an accurate solution we were more                                 interested in                                                        even if someone says ok                                                value of your cost is stuck in somewhere                                 here then this was a big bonus for our                                 business to take some actions on it so                                 we were if we took just raw cables                                 skipping all the application levels then                                 we started to process them like billions                                 of rows like                                                             created models based on the inputs from                                 business users and we gave it back to                                 them to run them with an easy governance                                 model on top of this and think I'm                                 running out of time so but this is the                                 last slide here so what is what was                                 expected and why did we choose all                                 tricks so this is an we were expected to                                 provide an agile prototyping prototyping                                 environment so there was no one willing                                 to say ok now we run a project that goes                                 for two years and then we                                 you what happens so this was not the                                 case speed wasn't in requirement yeah so                                 everybody said that we have to crunch                                 lot of data but this has to happen in                                 hours and not even in days so this was a                                 genuine requirement then we have to                                 because of the our landscape it was a                                 kind of a messed up data sources yeah so                                 we have to bring them all together link                                 them this data and provide the insights                                 which is also shareable across our                                 organization and that's where Isaac's                                 gallery was really helpful to provide                                 very very simple the wunens model that                                 helped us to provide such an such a                                 collaborative and sharing model across                                 our organization as I said before our                                 motto is always we go for whenever there                                 is a pie then we buy the solution rather                                 than build on its own although we are                                 changing now because of our data science                                 environment also with our working with                                 our startups so we are also trying to                                 build but then we when there is minimum                                 customization then we try to prefer this                                 which was perfect for us with with                                 ultrix most important the license model                                 because there was no need for us to                                 provide an heavy investment cost so the                                 first use case that I mentioned if we                                 were to go for a traditional catalog                                 management or an ETL or data preparation                                 tool we would have gone spending at                                 least                                                                  was very very easy and finally we had                                 excellent partners I don't know if                                 someone from information slab is here                                 but they were really good in bringing us                                 on board as well as our end users there                                 is lot of materials and blocks available                                 and the all the open source models that                                 are available works perfectly fine you                                 can import them you can input all the                                 our models into a tricks and you can                                 also run them through so thank you all                                 I think I'm three minutes or more but if                                 you want some questions we can we can                                 still go through or do i yeah we don't                                 have any time because it's like five                                 minutes the next talk so okay so I got                                 you are here and I can I can I can stay                                 here outside and anybody want me to                                 speak in person - Gopi thank you very                                 much go here                                 pick applause thank you                                 [Applause]
