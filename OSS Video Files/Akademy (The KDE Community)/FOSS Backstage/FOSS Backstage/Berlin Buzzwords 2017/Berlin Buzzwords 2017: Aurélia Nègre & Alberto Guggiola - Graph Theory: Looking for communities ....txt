Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2017: Aurélia Nègre & Alberto Guggiola - Graph Theory: Looking for communities ...
Publication date: 2017-06-15
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2017
Description: 
	Community detection in social networks enables to identify densely connected groups of individuals, as well as to dynamically characterise their behavior.

This highly innovative field brings new business opportunities for fraud detection, digital marketing and HR analytics.

After an introduction to Graph Theory and community detection algorithms, we will present two scenarios where these concepts are applied to social networks data: Meetup and LinkedIn.

Will our algorithms manage to identify Data Science communities ?

	                              so hello everybody and we are going to                               present you this this use case on graph                               theory about communities first of all a                               little word about about us so we come                               from a start up our coastal district                               here in base in Paris that is called the                               quantum entry we are around the                                       scientist and we have several clients in                               different in different business and we                                have project little bit on proof of                                concepts and also up to the production                                part of the of the data science machine                                learning artificial intelligence                                projects and in particular we had we are                                having a lot of different use cases                                about fraud detection predictive                                maintenance consumer insights in                                marketing and and others we are during                                one project in fraud detection in                                particular we have to deal with this                                community detection problem that is                                quite interesting and there are still a                                lot of academic research also on this                                problem and so we are going to present                                you a little bit about this first of all                                we are going to talk about graph theory                                so what is a graph and the question                                could really be reversed what is not a                                graph because a graph is just a set of                                elements also called the nodes that are                                interconnected by links or edges and so                                really about any system can be seen as a                                graph because for any system we can just                                look at the basic the components and how                                they are interconnected here we had just                                two examples but many more can be                                thought of so a social network where                                each node is a person and the links are                                just acting the interconnection between                                between different different people and a                                transportation network so it's clear                                that just looking at the set of nodes or                                elements and their interconnections                                can see a lot of interesting                                characteristic of the system in this                                very basic very cute eyes the version of                                the of the of the problem and so several                                different use cases can be defined on                                graph theory we are just presenting some                                of them very shortly the first one well                                known finding the best route on a graph                                and we can think about it as using GPS                                GPS data but also finding paths on a                                social network for connecting different                                peoples and this is a use case a                                LinkedIn is using a lot for for finding                                the connection between within people                                spreading dynamics so if we want to                                maximize the spreading as in a viral                                marketing campaign or to minimize a                                spreading as in a vaccination campaign                                this is something we can study just                                looking at the graph structure of our                                system structure importance and their                                sending the most important nodes and the                                most famous example is a Google Pagerank                                that is interested in finding the most                                important pages so to propose a best                                best answer to our queries and Domino                                effects the what-if scenario that can                                help us design more stable and more                                robust system with by taking into                                account the possible effect of failures                                of some nodes or of attacks to to some                                of the nodes of the of the system but we                                are going to present another use case                                that is the communicate action so in                                this case you can see the kotor shift                                network and it's very clear that the                                structure of this graph is not at all                                random you can see there are strongly                                connected part we call them community                                it's not very well designed as the                                mathematical concepts but but it's                                really see - it's very easy to to see                                them and are these communities are quite                                are not so much connective between                                between each other and one can ask a                                series of questions about this problem                                and one of them for instance is where                                are the bridges that is there are some                                nodes that are much more important                                because R denotes enabling the                                communication between different                                components of this graph and so if we                                want to preserve the strata community                                structure of this this network for                                instance we have to protect this dots                                because are the ones enabling us to have                                 a complan ik a unique graph and not                                 having a different separated components                                 if we want to build to build such                                 communities there are two main                                 approaches so the first the first of                                 them is a top-down approach as it is we                                 try and separate the different                                 communities by cutting the bridges                                 connecting them in this case for                                 instance we are going to cut this link                                 so to obtain two different groups of                                 node that are going to be our                                 communities the other approaches kind of                                 the other way around that is we are                                 going to gather the most densely                                 connected part of the network for                                 instance by having a random work on on                                 our network and by studying the time                                 around the working is spending on on                                 each part of the of the network and so                                 these two approaches originate different                                 algorithmic an be used for solving this                                 this problem if we think about the                                 importance of node in this case also we                                 have a a                                                                problem the first definition is a global                                 importance in this case the red node on                                 the left hand side it's the most                                 important at the global level because                                 it's the node that sits                                 gathering the the graph and if we think                                 about removing this red node the graph                                 is going to collapse into different                                 components and there are definitions                                 that consider the local importance for                                 instance the number of links another                                 health and in this case the red node is                                 quite far away from the other answer and                                 it's the locally the most important                                 because it's very well connected with                                 with the others but from a global point                                 of view is not that important                                 so the two answer are really telling us                                 something different about the system                                 other alternatives well-known for                                 instance Google page rank algorithm that                                 is really aiming at finalize that                                 finding this most important node in the                                 network we saw two important concepts in                                 graph theory                                 so finding communities and Lud                                 importance okay well if tomorrow you're                                 curious about graph and you want to                                 analyze your own Facebook or Twitter                                 dress you want to know okay                                 which tools can I use so it depends on                                 the amount of data you have so if you                                 are in a small data framework you can                                 use some nice analytical libraries so                                 for instance Network kicks it's a pure                                 Python libraries where you can do a lot                                 of things but not very performing you                                 can use a dress tool so it's written in                                 C++ so it'll be better but it can also                                 be used with Python and personally I                                 would recommend the eye graph library                                 it's written in C and you can use it                                 both is the C library or with Python or                                 even our and it's quite complete                                 regarding NURBS importance measures and                                 community detection algorithm because we                                 just presented the two main approaches                                 but they are actually plenty of                                 algorithms that you can use and don't                                 hesitate if you have questions so we can                                 go a little bit further                                 okay if you are using spark there is                                 also a spark library graphics it is                                 quite limited regarding the number of                                 algorithmic are into but you have the                                 page rank you have one a community                                 detection algorithm the level                                 propagation you have also some matrix                                 like the number of triangles the number                                 of connected components in your graph so                                 currently it's quite limited but                                 hopefully in the future and some new                                 algorithm will be added and suddenly you                                 might also consider using the graphic                                 database so neo                                                          reference and extremely good for signing                                 the shortest path and computing the                                 degree of the node and that it really                                 really depend on the use case you have                                 for instance if you just want to do some                                 select like select the nodes with a                                 given degree or with specific properties                                 it might not be the best option but if                                 you have really assigning the best fruit                                 use case it's really something that you                                 should consider okay and now we have a                                 small G more time and using LinkedIn                                 data and the eye graph library so we                                 will show you a bit how you can load                                 some graph data make some summary                                 statistics find communities and compute                                 a few metrics that are interesting to                                 analyze network                                 okay so first step I load my graph so                                 it's a LinkedIn Network and graph of a                                 person you read it in a standard graph                                 format so here a graph ml with the                                 angriff library and then you can do some                                 summary statistics so for instance the                                 number of nodes the number of links and                                 the node attributes you have because in                                 a in a graph format you have of course                                 the nodes and the links but you can also                                 have a node and links attributes so for                                 instance the name of the person or with                                 all the additional information you can                                 have three-seater okay Becker hey okay                                 so here I have some information about                                 one node so injuries and data we have                                 the headline of the person it's highly                                 the country where this person come from                                 its city and its industry so but it is a                                 standard LinkedIn profile information                                 you have you can do a nice cut so this                                 is a network okay so this is really a                                 real network so it seems to have a kind                                 of structure like something here                                 something here and they could be like                                 some groups and some interesting things                                 to find the density for instance is an                                 interesting metric so the density is                                 basically defined by the number of links                                 you have in your breath among the number                                 of possible links so if every node is                                 connected to every node it's just one                                 hundred percent and here it's seven                                 percent and as we mentioned finding                                 communities is finding the most densely                                 connected subgroups so fortunately if                                 you find a community the density should                                 increase from                                            something larger than                                                   you to compute many centrality matrix so                                 node in vertex measures so here we just                                 computed the degree and the page rank so                                 the number of direct neighbors and the                                 the Google Pagerank                                 and in both cases the the node with the                                 maximum importance is actually a                                 think-tank and why is something like                                 that it makes sense                                 medically this think tank is connected                                 to many other nodes in this graph that's                                 why it appears to be kind of important                                 in this class because it is connected to                                 many people so many people need to and                                 leave this node to extend information                                 now we want to do some community                                 detection and put nice colors and in                                 these graphs so there are many algorithm                                 that you can use we use a wealthtrack so                                 it's based on a random walk and it uses                                 only the network structure so it's not                                 using the information that okay this                                 person come from as unfold this person                                 is coming from Paris or whatever it's                                 just the links and that they are in this                                 graph but we could have several                                 approaches okay so we run an our                                 algorithm and find some communities so                                 what can we see first it seems to make                                 sense kind of well there is a group here                                 another here another here so it seems                                 quite ok we can also see that some                                 person seems to be bridges okay the                                 colors are not great but this person                                 here is the bridge between these                                 communities this committee and this                                 committee and if you cut this link and                                 this link                                 well this communities cannot communicate                                 anymore so now we want to analyze a bit                                 our communities because of course if you                                 know what are the real communities it's                                 easy                                 you compare what you found with what the                                 reality is but if you don't well you                                 have to search for matrix and search if                                 these groups make sense so here we can                                 look at the node attributes so are these                                 people coming from the same city are                                 they having a similar job and so on                                 here we first unlike the pink superevil                                 group and with the information we have                                 the industry a country city and headline                                 okay                                 so among this seven person well most of                                 them are coming from the financial                                 sector most of them are German in                                 Frankfurt and they must have been all                                 working currently at European data                                 warehouse very society bathing in five                                 foot so with that any prior knowledge of                                 these properties our algorithm actually                                 found a community of colleagues in a                                 functional company and control now if we                                 look at the red community a bigger one                                 and make a sub graph we can see the                                 problem thing okay so we have a                                 community and but there is something a                                 bit weird                                 here it's kind of more densely connected                                 than here so we wonder if it really is a                                 good structure of if you still and need                                 to do to try some algorithm to find a                                 subgroups just to remark the density in                                 this community is a                                                   than                                                                     and identifies two subgroups first one                                 here and a second one here and some                                 isolated nuts all a grain of limit so we                                 can discuss that later and if we analyze                                 the blue one and look at the headlines                                 actually and we just found the pot meet                                 regroup and all these persons are on                                 working I company tree and this group is                                 actually a group of random recruiters                                 and HR on LinkedIn that are trying to                                 connect with the prison frame completely                                 and if we zoom again on the poetry group                                 we now have a density of a                                             many many links among the possible links                                 are created so that was just that that's                                 it so it was an introduction to graph                                 theory and what you can do okay so it's                                 funny to find communities but of course                                 you must have a use case and often it                                 can be for a fraud detection or H or a                                 narrative or a different thing so that                                 if you have any questions we're quite                                 happy to Center so thanks totally                                 allowed based on so do you have any                                 questions about it                                 any questions                                 really nice demo very impressive I was                                 wondering let's say I need to process                                 all of LinkedIn data can you speak a bit                                 louder yes                                 so I suppose it's a subset of LinkedIn                                 what you showed us right now it's a                                 network of one person in this case of me                                 so it's my complete same thing all right                                 so let's say I need to calculate like                                 all of linking LinkedIn data or like                                 something really really big can you                                 explain like a strategy of how we can go                                 from you know like CSV to to this                                 so like can we use usually API your                                 question usually a data doesn't come as                                 a connected graph it comes as like                                 wolves in a file or like events or                                 something like that so when you talk                                 about the pipeline of JSON to this like                                 that so in this case I use a website and                                 the celeb I can write it you know and                                 basically it provides a list of notes so                                 like on the Gryphon and it provides a                                 matrix with one if the two persons are                                 connected and zero else so this is the                                 so called address and symmetries and                                 it's another way of hearing a graph so                                 you can have directly a graph in a graph                                 format or it can also be just a matrix                                 so basically you have a list of nodes                                 and a matrix and then you can easily                                 with a graph well okay this is my list                                 of ID's and this is my address and some                                 matrix so don't have a graph if I met at                                 just something if we are thinking about                                 very big graph having the matter n by n                                 matrix with all the the links or the                                 absence of links is typically not a good                                 idea because typically the graphs are                                 quite sparse this is a a lot of the                                 links are missing and so more efficient                                 way of representing the the graph is                                 just by by telling the list of all the                                 links existing and typically for bigger                                 graphs is it's the only way of                                 with with the representation of a                                 graphic is just listing the couple of                                 notes these are the direct actually                                 connected because otherwise you are                                 obtaining a very very big matrix where                                 the                                                                    so it's not that useful hang out on                                 questions no I'm curious does this work                                 also undirected graphs what the direct                                 what meaning can we give to the arrows                                 when clustering well I mean I mean there                                 is there is a two-part answer that is                                 the first thing you can do when you have                                 a directed graph is to look at it as an                                 undirected one that is just neglecting                                 this information this is the easy                                 solution on the other hand if you really                                 want to exploit this information of the                                 direction of the links that is the case                                 if you are nicing Twitter for instance                                 of a social network it is a not $                                      directed so it's something you want to                                 keep in your analysis it's more                                 difficult typically you have to split                                 your problem into incoming and outgoing                                 links and so you're going for instance                                 to obtain two different kind of                                 communities that represents the                                 communities of incoming links and the                                 communities of outgoing links and then                                 it's up to you really to find a good                                 compromise between the two so - so to                                 understand something more about the                                 structure of the graph but if there is                                 no common solution it's it kind of an                                 art to find the correct definitions to                                 be able and extract some useful                                 information and just a remark and so                                 most of the community detection                                 algorithms are doesn't support a                                 directed graph in the case for the wall                                 trap but you have some algorithms that                                 allow and directly dress for instance                                 alphabet Internet and yeah there is an                                 algorithm to find communities with the                                 directed links that the meaning changes                                 this sothanks died now we have a coffee                                 break and we come back help us for so                                 enjoy coffee                                 [Applause]
