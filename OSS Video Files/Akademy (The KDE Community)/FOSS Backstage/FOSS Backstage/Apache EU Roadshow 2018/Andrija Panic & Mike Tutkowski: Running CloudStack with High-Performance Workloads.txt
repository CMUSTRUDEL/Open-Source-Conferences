Playlist: Apache EU Roadshow 2018
Description: 
	This presentation will focus on my real-world experiences transitioning from a smaller CloudStack IaaS provider with light workloads to a more sophisticated configuration required to run enterprise workloads. We will cover specific differences in running KVM-based CloudStack on shared storage. In particular, we will focus on discussing light workloads vs. those having more serious CPU and IO demands and how to solve different stability, performance and usability challenges by leveraging Managed Storage in CloudStack
