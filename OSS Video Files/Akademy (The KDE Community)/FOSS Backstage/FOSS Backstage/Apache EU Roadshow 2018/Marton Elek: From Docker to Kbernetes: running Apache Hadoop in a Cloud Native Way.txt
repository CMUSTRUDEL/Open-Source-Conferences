Playlist: Apache EU Roadshow 2018
Description: 
	Kubernetes slowly become one of the most popular container runtime environment while Hadoop has already been widely used open source bigdata platform since a long time. The questions is here: how can we use the new cloud-native toolset to administer and manage Hadoop based clusters? Is there any benefit to run Hadoop and other bigdata application on top of Kubernetes? In this presentation I will show that Hadoop is not a legacy application but it could be run very easy in cloud-native environment thanks to the generic and distributed by design.
