Description: 
	Whether it is a Microservices-based solution that is used under high load and processes rapidly growing volumes of data, or an application that does not use Microservices, both usually face the same issues:Data are still stored in disk-backed databases that can no longer keep pace with the growing volumes of data that have to be stored and processed in parallel. As a result, conventional databases are becoming a performance bottleneck affecting the overall solution or application. In the past, a solution's high-availability guarantee was a nice-to-have feature. Today, high-availability of an application has become a de-facto requirement.
