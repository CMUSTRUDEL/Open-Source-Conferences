Imagine a shopper searches for "coffee". The search results mindlessly repeat brand name, ground coffee over and over. Technically relevant. But not very useful. Not mixed in are results appealing to a different kind of "coffee" searcher:  organic coffee, whole bean, espresso, or related coffee equipment. 

Beyond relevant results is Result Set Diversity: providing not just technically correct answers, but a diverse (though still relevant) view of what's possible in the search system. Showing our grocery searcher that we might, after all, have something they want.

In this panel, we'll discuss Result Set Diversity in search. We'll hear from teams working to summarize for users the diverse array of options available to them given their query. An ideal search experience helps provide next steps, broaden the user's understanding of the content related to keywords, and cover the user's possible, unspoken intent.

Join host Doug Turnbull and search practitioners, Andreas Wagner, Felipe Besson, and Lev Gershenzon, as we hear experiences measuring & solving Results Diversity, with a panel discussion on the Result Search Diversity problem.

	                              today we're going to be talking about                               search results diversity which is a                               topic near and dear to my heart we have                               three talks that are gonna cover this                               from a couple different angles for about                                                                                                     a discussion on this for the most part                               we sort of I'm gonna pitch the questions                               to the panel but if you do have some                                additional questions feel free to put                                those in the haystack TV select channel                                just really quickly so this this topic I                                think is really interesting and I'm just                                gonna I'll talk about it for a little                                bit so I've been interested in of course                                search relevance for a long time and                                having written relevant search and and                                been part of open source connections                                it's been a big passion of mine to try                                to figure out ways that we can help                                users deliver sort of more accurate                                results that answer and support their                                information need I feel like maybe at                                the beginning of the                                               people were putting together maybe a                                solar application or elasticsearch                                application they'd ship it and only                                realize after they've shipped it that                                hey these search results are no good and                                I think the awareness of that has really                                increased over the last decade which has                                been really exciting and as as we                                continue to evolve and it sort of                                improve our practice of search relevance                                another problem or another challenge                                that you might argue counterbalances the                                search relevance or maybe it doesn't                                starts to creep in for me personally I                                started to see this search result                                diversity problem when in some of our                                earlier learning to rank projects we                                started doing learning to rank with                                elasticsearch in                                                    first clients for for doing this was a                                job search company and what was really                                interesting about that experience is for                                some of the queries we started do a                                stream like the results were arguably                                extremely relevant like we couldn't                                really make them any more close to what                                the user seemed to need by their query                                that                                and then then that then we couldn't                                improve that anymore                                but what we started to notice was when                                we look across the queries there's so                                much duplication and so many things are                                really extremely similar so if you                                search for something like a cook job all                                you would get were the same ten Chipola                                jobs in the top                                                       really if you're searching for a cook                                maybe you want to understand your entire                                options and what the menu so to speak of                                this of this query might be and this                                this is a fairly interesting and                                challenging problems because a lot of                                our search engines as we'll see are like                                solar elasticsearch they're pretty                                heavily biased towards okay can you get                                the ranking and scoring function right                                the question of can you give people a                                broad set of results that are also                                relevant but kind of draw a wide enough                                net to show them a top many maybe many                                different senses of the query or many                                different possible directions the user                                might go that's still not really                                something baked into our search engines                                right now so I think this is a pretty                                challenging topic but I think                                increasingly a lot of teams are seeing                                that it's not just enough to get the                                right results but it's important to give                                people all the right possible options                                and interpretations of their intention                                as people enter in search keywords so                                with that sort of framing of the problem                                I'm going to introduce our speakers one                                at a time and let them kick off cook off
