One of the things I like, working as a consultant, is working on different challenges, find parallels between the various solutions, and learn a lot along the way. I worked for customers among the most prominent e-commerce, travel, and food industries in The Netherlands. In this talk, I want to share the top 10 lessons learned from doing search projects at these customers for the past ten years. Without giving away spoilers, the lessons vary in areas like organizational structure, KPIs, technology, content, and user experience. After the talk, you have some ideas and inspirations for improvements to your search projects.

	                              so today we're going to talk about ten                               lessons learned in search projects the                               past ten years I'm yet oh I'm going to                               do this with my colleague Barron as we                               have a tight schedule we will not take                               too much time to introduce ourselves so                               ten years of search it's a lot of a lot                               of time I still remember the first                               project that we did together                                about ten years ago we were well                                educated in in elasticsearch we knew how                                to install it when you have to configure                                it we knew how to talk to it when you                                have the right queries so we were ready                                for customers and we were ready to help                                customers so the first customer we we                                went to started asking questions and                                then he was asking questions about vm                                   and he started asking questions about                                problems with stemming and stop words                                that you could lose words even if you                                did it in the right and the wrong                                combination and byron and myself were                                there and we started looking at each                                other like oh man we still got a lot to                                learn and well we're now                                         further we've gained a lot of experience                                we know a lot more about search these                                days but we're still learning and I                                think that's very important in the                                search domain that you keep on learning                                keep on improving and keep on getting                                better experience to the search users                                let's start so another customer that I I                                was at I was called to to help them                                improve their search solution and while                                it took me a few weeks to to go through                                it thoroughly and I prepared a nice                                presentation for the management team I                                of course it was not as technical as you                                see in this slide with all the formulas                                for that was a kind of a technical                                presentation where I created a road map                                what we should do and how we could                                improve so I put my my laptop at screen                                and I I wanted to start talking and                                immediately the manager took the word                                and he said well search is really bad or                                he did use a little bit other words that                                I'm not going to repeat here but I                                even start my presentation and he was                                showing on the website why search was                                bad and I almost felt like that was it                                so that was what I had to do so when you                                recognize this maybe in this case no one                                cares enough about search could be wrong                                because he cared enough to hire me and                                to tell me that he thought it was very                                bad but they don't really care enough                                about improving it together and and to                                learn about how to improve it there's                                not really like a business plan in                                available and in how to improve search                                and why and the amount of budget that is                                needed and those kind of things and                                there's also nobody responsible for                                search in a management team usually they                                just see it as a sort of a technical                                problem and that's it so if you're in                                this situation the result is usually                                that the customer just tells you that                                search is bad and you just need to fix                                it or the solution to this to this thing                                is that before you actually start                                analyzing the search solution you need                                to prepare the management and the other                                involved people of the company for the                                search challenge that are going to take                                you have to come with a sort of a common                                understanding of what the search problem                                is and you have to explain that                                improving search is a journey and not                                just a singular a single event that when                                it's done it's done                                you need to keep improving you need to                                keep doing it together one thing that we                                learned is that you can execute sort of                                a maturity scan and the result of the                                scan is usually a road map in which                                steps you're going to improve search for                                the customer so the first lesson is that                                you need a business driver to succeed                                with your search challenge without the                                business involvement and without a clear                                goal together with the business it's                                going to be hard to get a very good                                search experience as general just                                explained search needs a business driver                                in order to become a success but the                                 only way you can help a business figure                                 out and where to steer that direction is                                 when you give them some data to act on                                 or analytics                                 so what happens if you don't have any                                 latex slide then improvements are made                                 without clear goals and nobody really                                 has a clue what you're improving                                 whether you're improving sales or                                 customer experience at all now a lot of                                 times business has one KPI mostly                                 conversion rate which is a good thing to                                 act on as a KPI but there are multiple                                 KPIs that you can actually look at and                                 monitor and create reports for so if we                                 check the next slide then what we                                 recommend is actually from the start                                 start creating some reports and no doubt                                 some KPIs that you want to monitor and                                 keeping track for instance zero results                                 is the most obvious one because it                                 really points out what terms users are                                 searching but then end up with an empty                                 page meaning that you either have                                 something missing in your matching setup                                 or you're just missing content which you                                 can act on by getting that contract zero                                 conversion is an interesting one                                 that you actually have all the search                                 terms that people get products for but                                 then next up they don't buy anything                                 meaning that there could be something                                 wrong with the amount with the type of                                 products that you're returning then we                                 have often found but never clicked and                                 often click but never bought which                                 actually could tell you something about                                 those kind of products that people are                                 looking for but not actually converting                                 but I think the most important part of                                 these kind of analytics is that you                                 start with them early create reports so                                 it's visible by everyone who's working                                 on this search solution to come up with                                 ways on how to improve the search in the                                 future and then the most important part                                 is to import business with that so I                                 think the really the second lesson is                                 willing to start and discuss analytics                                 like straight from the beginning and                                 involve everyone that has something to                                 do with the world                                 totally all right so now we got                                 analytics fix analytics gives a really                                 nice overview of where you're standing                                 at the moment so you monitor your live                                 performance and see where people have                                 issues but we know that search is like                                 an evolving system where we want to make                                 changes and make improvements and                                 normally what you would do when you want                                 to make improvements to your setup is                                 you think of an idea of something that                                 could                                 prove your relevancy you could approve                                 add extra features but normally you                                 start with an Ibis 'as you implement                                 your change you run an a/b test for two                                 weeks and you get results back and                                 they're negative back to the drawing                                 board the next side so the symptom would                                 be that you make changes but those in                                 changes in the end don't expect you the                                 same results as you expected                                 so you don't have a positive outcome the                                 downside of that is that your release                                 side was slow because you have to go                                 back to the drawing board think of a new                                 idea and start a whole phase over again                                 with a/b testing so you don't really                                 know up front before you put the test                                 live whether you're gonna have a good                                 result so what we normally start with                                 when we go to your customer or we start                                 helping out an existing customer is                                 start with the judgment list an                                 adjustment list is a list of judgments                                 where judgment is a relevancy mapping                                 between a product and a search term you                                 can boil down to a question is this                                 product relevant for this search term so                                 we can make these judgments by looking                                 for instance at our top hundred queries                                 and we have some regressions queries                                 that we know are sometimes a bit iffy                                 within this engine and we go over the                                 result page and we go through each                                 product and say yes I think this product                                 is relevant or this product is                                 irrelevant for certain query now                                 discussion lists allows you to do a                                 couple of things one of them is start                                 with offline testing where you can run a                                 test and compare two versions and see if                                 your search is actually improving for                                 instance if we go to the next slide then                                 what you see here is our each shop that                                 we built with luminance and on the left                                 side you can see three product rows and                                 on the right side you see three product                                 works now each row is a part of a                                 different engine so on the right side we                                 improve the query by adding fuzziness                                 and now we can use our judgments the                                 green and row underlines on the each                                 product which defines is this product                                 relevant yes or no now if we compare the                                 metrics on top then we see that on the                                 right side precision is lower then                                 the left side and we get more hits so we                                 could actually learn that the change                                 that we did adding fuzziness is that                                 it's not a positive effect so we don't                                 even have to give you any details now                                 this makes us our release cycle a lot                                 shorter so if we can go to the next then                                 the lesson would be if you start with                                 this judgment list up front and maintain                                 them and keep evolving them you can use                                 them to do more offline testing and make                                 sure that your changes actually are                                 verified before you put somebody ok when                                 I usually when I comment a new customer                                 especially if it's the customer where I                                 will be for a longer period of time the                                 first thing I check is where is the                                 coffee and how is the coffee because                                 coffee is important to me                                 Wow very very common is that you have                                 very bad input for the coffee machine                                 which is instant coffee and if you're                                 lucky and there are being such input for                                 the coffee then still the machine                                 doesn't always make it and good coffee                                 well with search it's not really                                 different with search if you have bad                                 content that comes into your search                                 machine your search solution then it's                                 very hard to also create good results to                                 your users so if you have bad content                                 the problem is that you use is most                                 likely will not find what they're                                 looking for and you have to do very                                 advanced things in your queries and have                                 to be very large and very and a lot of                                 exceptions to at least make them work                                 and give some relevant content to your                                 users of course there is a solution to                                 that and that is improving your content                                 there's a number of ways that you can                                 improve your content first is for                                 instance adding domain knowledge so if                                 you know the categories of your system                                 you can recognize them in the content                                 you can make them very explicit maybe                                 there is a mismatch in the categories                                 from your supplier and that you have so                                 be very thorough in to determining that                                 categories and add them to your content                                 it could also be that your supplier                                 delivers you items that you don't even                                 want to                                 so of course you could add a flag to the                                 item and then filter it in your clearly                                 but it's even better not to import them                                 at all another thing that is very good                                 habit to do is to learn from bad                                 performing content                                 Biron already talked about analytics                                 that you can use like items that were                                 found but never clicked and items that                                 were clicks but never bought these are                                 indications that there is something                                 wrong with your content it could be that                                 there is too many search terms in the                                 content that people try to get into be                                 always in the result list so then it                                 doesn't say anything about the product                                 it's just a matching thing it could also                                 be that it's lacking a lot of terms why                                 and therefore it's it's not really                                 clicked because maybe there is no                                 picture in there or the name is very                                 strange and you can learn a lot from                                 this content as well by just looking at                                 analytics and of course if you see these                                 errors and these content are coming for                                 your suppliers you can fix them yourself                                 but it's even better to ask them to fix                                 it because then you have less energy to                                 put into it and they can really think                                 about their own content and help you in                                 getting their products better into your                                 search engine this is an example that I                                 have on a Dutch website so the search                                 terms are in Dutch and why did I take a                                 Dutch example well one because I'm Dutch                                 but the other reason is that in the in                                 Holland we use compound words a lot so                                 if you look at aftershave it's not very                                 strange to put it in as two words or to                                 use it as one word but in this search                                 engine you see that they give back                                 different results so if you write them                                 down as two words then you get                                    matching products and if you write them                                 down as one word you have over                                         and there are completely different                                 products but most likely this is not the                                 experience that you want to give to your                                 user                                 so by improving the content and picking                                 one of these two categories in your                                 content then most likely you will get                                 better results to your customers so the                                 lesson in this case is that you have to                                 be in control of your content process                                 if you're not in control we will lose                                 the result to your critics and in the                                 end you will lose your customer well of                                 course there's more to it I mean even if                                 your content is great then still you can                                 have an engine that doesn't work at all                                 and these days there are a lot of                                 engines that you can use some open                                 source on closed source and they come                                 with all these nice bells and whistles                                 that you can use and they all promise                                 you the easiest way out to get the best                                 experience for your user but it's not                                 always the case I have a number of                                 customers where they were using a                                 machine learning model to give back                                 results to all the users and the the                                 trend for these new solutions was that                                 there were very strange results getting                                 back to the users so it wasn't really a                                 textual match but the the trend model                                 thought that by entering a certain term                                 that people would most likely like that                                 thing as well I'm not saying that                                 artificial intelligence or machine                                 learning is wrong in the search area I                                 think is it's getting there and it's                                 used being used a lot these days but you                                 have to be very careful to start out                                 with this trade model before you                                 understand what your search is doing and                                 how your users are behaving so the                                 symptom here would be that fancy options                                 don't always improve search results and                                 it could be that users see straight hits                                 maybe no results at all or they see no                                 results where they would expect them and                                 this could all be by miss tuning your                                 search engine so the solution to this                                 would be that you should not trust                                 out-of-the-box configurations so you can                                 look at these bells and whistles of                                 course you should look at stemming but                                 in different languages the results of                                 the stemming are quite different and                                 default out-of-the-box timing could be                                 worse than for instance using hung spell                                 expansions and and try to AdWords                                 yourself if you see that a lot in the                                 analytics you also have to be careful                                 with stop words just like I mentioned in                                 the beginning of this presentation where                                 Miss configuring stop words could even                                 cause not using the                                 specific words that you should                                 definitely use in your query another                                 thing to think about is using synonyms                                 synonyms are misused a lot to make                                 everything work that doesn't work but                                 the tricky bit is that you turn out to                                 have like a hundred thousands of                                 synonyms nobody understands them anymore                                 and nobody dares changing them because                                 they don't know the effect and the last                                 one I want to stress out here is the use                                 of engrams engrams are used quite a lot                                 as well and of course they can be handy                                 but the tricky bit with engrams could be                                 that you have a lot of matches again if                                 you make them small enough that almost                                 everything matches and it's naughty not                                 hard to give as many matches as you need                                 but then what is your relevance of these                                 matches this can become a lot harder                                 when using all the boosting options that                                 you have in your environment or in your                                 engine so this was one of the examples                                 of a customer that we had where on the                                 left side you see the old situation and                                 on the right side you see the optimize                                 that is now in production on the left                                 side where we were looking for M&Ms                                     was taken out by the standard analyzer                                 and suddenly when looking for eminence                                 we see X apparently some customers                                 thought it was a good idea but we know                                 from the analytics that these eggs were                                 actually bought sometimes but whether                                 that's good search behavior                                 well that's questionable on the right                                 hand side you see that we did something                                 different in the analyzers and now the                                 search engine is a lot better tuned and                                 now you actually see or M&M products in                                 there even M&M peanut butter so the                                 lesson here would be that of course you                                 can use advanced features but you should                                 use them to your own advantage and not                                 just because you can all right mmm I                                 think over the last few years the                                 question that I received the most when                                 consulting at a company was why is this                                 product about this product or why is                                 this product not there because I                                 expected it there and it actually boils                                 down to one of the problems that happens                                 a lot the next slide is that it really                                 hard to understand why certain results                                 pop up                                 that is not just for developers or                                 people that are working directly on the                                 system but these questions also pop up                                 from other people inside the company                                 than or actually maybe maintaining a                                 category or that our product managers                                 they will want to know why certain                                 products are not in the spot that they                                 expect them to be so not knowing how                                 this comes makes it really hard to                                 explain these management results and                                 also there's no really easy way of                                 checking in which order products are or                                 how they come that that order has been                                 made up so what we like to do actually                                 almost on every project that we go to is                                 to use or create the right tooling in                                 order to help us get this information                                 now maybe some of you has been to the                                 workshop yesterday from Eric Johannes                                 bar Rene about towards an open to source                                 set for e-commerce the tools prescribed                                 there is something that we could also                                 use but mostly we check with clients                                 what their purpose removed is so it                                 could be that they that we could use the                                 open-source tooling but sometimes it's                                 not possible and then we will create our                                 own tooling around it and what it allows                                 you to do is to really dig into your                                 essentials of how your search engine is                                 working and help figure out why certain                                 things work as they work the most                                 important part is that if you create                                 these insights you can start sharing                                 them with non-technical people as well                                 meaning that they won't have to come to                                 you every time to ask why am I not                                 seeing my product or why is this product                                 here at all one of the steps you could                                 take after that is after opening that up                                 is create these kind of screens which                                 gives this explanation and maybe even                                 give control to the non-technical people                                 to influence these kind of things so for                                 instance here on the left side you see a                                 breakdown of the first three products                                 that are returned for the search of the                                 coffee table and the blue bars actually                                 explain why the match or why the ranking                                 is what it is                                 so which terms have matched if it was                                 match because of a synonym and so on and                                 so on and on the right side we see what                                 happens to our search term when we when                                 we analyze it so how does our analysis                                 chain work this will really help to                                 figure out okay if I search this term                                 why is it matched is it match because of                                 the synonym                                 or is it because for instance on the                                 left side of the analysis chain you see                                 at the end that we have combined the                                 coffee table word into one term because                                 we have a lot of these compound issues                                 that yet already shared before so I                                 think the key takeaway from this is that                                 you should open up search as fast as                                 possible to non-technical people because                                 it really helps create that mutual                                 understanding of how the engine works                                 and it really helps other people to come                                 up with ideas to even improve and make                                 the whole solution better alright I'm                                 not sure if some of most of you who                                 maybe notice image this was an image                                 from two weeks ago                                 the historic launch the crew dragon                                 missile that delivered our astronauts to                                 the ISS two weeks ago and you might be                                 wondering what does this have to do with                                 search but we actually use missiles as                                 an analogy when we're talking about                                 search because the problem we're seeing                                 a lot is that a lot of people try to                                 build their engine with one big query so                                 if you have that next slide so a lot of                                 people that started out with search                                 tried to do everything in one query they                                 want to do full matching they want to                                 have partial matching they add some                                 fuzziness in case someone makes a typo                                 but the downside of these approaches is                                 that you for instance for the fuzzy part                                 also get really irrelevant products back                                 in your normal search so coming back to                                 the spacecraft we like to break this up                                 by doing multiple step queries and now                                 you don't always have the ability to do                                 this because maybe you have search it                                 comes with a solution that you are using                                 which means that you don't have any                                 personal control for it so that could be                                 a hard thing to start with                                 another thing about this big query that                                 it's really hard to tune especially when                                 it comes to ranking because you have so                                 many tiny components that actually                                 handle how search is working and of                                 course it's really hard later to add                                 stuff on top of that if it's already one                                 really big monster so what we generally                                 recommend if possible create a wrapper                                 search service around your search engine                                 which allows you to intercept and adjust                                 search terms before executing them you                                 can add your own own                                 giganto extract entities in categories                                 start a name a be test and the logging                                 of your search and responses so you can                                 use it later on to see how people are                                 actually using your system so for                                 instance as an example                                 this site is something we use for                                 looking up images for for our                                 presentation and we notice actually that                                 we made a typo while while searching for                                 some some images and you see that there                                 are no results now no one is really                                 helped by an empty result page but you                                 could say what some but this company                                 could have done is actually take this                                 multi-step approach and say okay first                                 we're gonna try and match everything                                 there is like they do now but in case                                 there are zero results fall back to                                 either partial matching or fuzzy                                 matching or swapping an operator which                                 would still get results I would still                                 allow the customer to actually find                                 maybe the product that they were looking                                 for so lesson would be is to use                                 multiple queries through a service                                 record because it allows you to have                                 this fine-grained ability to have more                                 control over what you're executing and                                 what you were returning to the user                                 alright so I think in any case it would                                 be the most ideal shopping experience                                 you could have you don't have to leave                                 your house you turn on TV you talk to                                 someone you say I want to have a pair of                                 pants now asking for a pair of pants is                                 pretty generic and freaking rods could                                 be any pen so the person across from you                                 would ask what kind of pens for what                                 occasion you start a conversation and I                                 think that is something we're not doing                                 enough with inserts right now and it's                                 really something we should strive for to                                 create this online experience as if                                 you're having a conversation with                                 someone in a store that's helping you                                 out to find your the product you're                                 looking for so we just talked about                                 creating the survey right before doing a                                 lot of backend stuff which is more in                                 the background but now we have to think                                 about the front end about the user                                 experience and we see a lot that a lot                                 of companies are not really helping                                 their users in trying to formulate their                                 query so what are you exactly looking                                 for in the case of pans if I search for                                 pens                                 then there is no no one asking me what                                 occasion we need it for where do you                                 wanna what kind of color do you want                                 mostly it's up to the user to go and                                 find the products they're looking for                                 but they could be that customers don't                                 find the products so they keep trying                                 they keep endlessly browsing for their                                 products and in the end they don't find                                 it and leave so what you want to do is                                 you want to start as early as possible                                 by thinking of ways to help your user                                 formulate their query so the solution                                 would be to find new ways and first step                                 would be offer filters like search is                                 more than a search bar if you give uses                                 filters they know how they work we can                                 actually drop down and find more                                 fine-grain narrow down what they're                                 looking for but the next thing will be                                 start a conversation dare to ask people                                 in a way that fits within your user                                 experience to help them narrow down the                                 request and even think about other                                 interventions because right now the                                 world more and more people are doing                                 online searches and e-commerce is                                 getting bigger especially in these times                                 so find a way to engage with your user                                 and one example of that is a company in                                 the Netherlands that for instance on the                                 left side if you search for LG OLED it                                 already shows you product it gives you                                 product recommendations give suggestions                                 on the search term but at the bottom it                                 actually says compare this TV with this                                 TV so it already knows that these are                                 the most common TVs that people are                                 thinking about and already giving an                                 option to fulfill my information need of                                 which one should I choose and on the                                 right side we see for instance a pop-up                                 modal that got opened when you click on                                 the information button next to look                                 facet and what this does it explains                                 what the facet is what options it gives                                 and it helps you narrow down your                                 searches for instance it's a screen                                 diagonal which diagonal is good for your                                 house so these are questions you will                                 get answered when you're in the store                                 and I think it's something you should                                 really try for to doing that as well in                                 your online experience so guide a would                                 be lesson a would be guide to your users                                 to what they are looking for either by                                 the convent                                 methods or think about new ways to                                 interact with users it's apparent Biden                                 was already talking about shopping                                 experience and it happens to be that                                 well during my study I was working in a                                 record store and well of course we                                 luckily had customers back then and they                                 would come to the counter and start                                 asking questions well these questions                                 could be very diverse it could be like                                 give me a city that has is a rock or it                                 could be a city in which they said well                                 give me City from the Beatles if it if                                 it's like one of these two then you                                 think okay oh I'm not that old that the                                 Beatles had only one CD so there were                                 multiple so what would they actually be                                 looking for so then I would generally                                 walk with them walk to the place where                                 the cities of all the Beatles are and                                 just just show them and ask if they can                                 find what they what they're looking for                                 if they have additional information if                                 they need other answers but it's a quite                                 different experience from someone that                                 comes in tells me I want to have the                                 city of YouTube or at Oldham but then I                                 know exactly what he wants I can just                                 pick it and he pays for it and it says                                 and he's gone so these are two quite                                 different experiences were in the first                                 experience someone is actually getting                                 inspired he wants to learn more about                                 what he needs lots of give a little bit                                 more information maybe he doesn't really                                 know what but we can help him and in the                                 other scenario he just nobody wants and                                 you want to buy it and he wants to be                                 gone the center in a lot of e-commerce                                 websites and other websites is that all                                 searches are treated the same so it                                 doesn't really matter if you're doing a                                 very broad term or if you going for a                                 very specific kind of query and of                                 course there is a solution to that as                                 well but first we need to recognize                                 whether as a query is actually a browse                                 or abroad query or a very specific                                 theory one way to do that is to compare                                 the clearly for instance to a category                                 tree because we see that if people type                                 in very broad term                                 that they usually resemble one of the                                 categories that we sell it could be that                                 it's one of the main categories it has a                                 lot of subcategories and then we can try                                 to ask the user if he might be searching                                 for one of these subcategories and then                                 pointed to well for more specifically                                 shows another way is to just gather                                 information about all the results that                                 you get check the categories that all                                 these products or or our items are in                                 and then calculate some entropy value if                                 this entropy is constant among a lot of                                 categories then is most likely a broad                                 search that they're doing but you don't                                 know really in what category the product                                 is then most likely it's a broad search                                 and then you can present again a                                 different experience where the user is                                 just challenged in giving more                                 information about what he's actually                                 looking for if the enthalpy value is                                 very high in just one or two categories                                 then the chances are big that it's much                                 more as Pacific search and then you can                                 just dive into those categories and and                                 present with very specific results to                                 the user so the trick here is that you                                 need to have more context from the users                                 so you could show them obvious                                 categories that that night matches is                                 creating but we also saw in the                                 cool-blue case that if you start typing                                 that we could already say like maybe                                 you're searching for this term in this                                 category then users don't even have to                                 go to the search and then they already                                 immediately in their interface can tell                                 you what they're actually looking for                                 and a final solution that I want to                                 point out is to diversify results and                                 the trick here is that if you know that                                 search returns multiple categories that                                 you that you implicitly show the top                                 result from each category so we don't                                 really focus on one or just the foot                                 ratio because it's hard to think about                                 top results if the terms are very broad                                 an example that I wanted to show is from                                 the Nike workshop where you search for                                 shoes this is what you get presented                                 it's mostly soccer shoes but you're not                                 really inspired to give more info                                 that you're actually looking for a                                 completely different kind of shoe of                                 course there are filters on the left                                 side but that you have to have to look                                 at it yourself and it would be easier to                                 just have some form of styles here where                                 you could get more specific information                                 and help and guide the user to a                                 different experience so this lesson is                                 that you have to give browser searches a                                 good experience                                 don't try to treat them as one because                                 they are different and and most likely                                 they are looking for a different                                 experience and it's not not that hard to                                 accomplish this if you know what you're                                 doing                                 so we're already at the final lesson and                                 in this lesson I want to point out that                                 we discussed quite some lessons that                                 were not technical when we talked about                                 the business we talked about the content                                 we talked about analytics we talked                                 about user experience and we talked                                 about technology this is intentional I                                 mean the reason is that it's very very                                 important that you get these disciplines                                 in make them work together as one team                                 but if they work as a team then the                                 chances are the biggest that you will                                 get the experience that you're looking                                 for with the right performance with                                 impact on the business so that in the                                 end you will have a prosperous company                                 the tintin is that search is treated as                                 a technical problem that you just fix                                 once I mean with the customer that I                                 talked about before he couldn't really                                 understand that it wasn't only the                                 search engine that needed an upgrade I                                 mean it was the whole process it was                                 that they needed to think about                                 analytics and whole organization needs                                 to understand the importance of search                                 for sales for instance and maybe it's                                 not important at all and then if you                                 learn from the analytics then maybe you                                 shouldn't have search at all which could                                 also be a solution but often the tech                                 guys get to say everything in this case                                 they are just being told to give me a                                 search they implement a search and                                 then they leave it like that and if they                                 have some time less maybe their credit                                 but that's about it                                 usually the users will leave because                                 they experience the smoke water looking                                 for the solution in this case would be                                 to create a team make the business                                 involved by together forming KPIs                                 reporting about these KPIs and be honest                                 that if you have this nice cool feature                                 and you test it and it shows up to be                                 less working                                 worse than it was before then just throw                                 it away again and try something else and                                 it's very important to include the user                                 experience guys in this part as well                                 because you want to be sure users and                                 without a good user experience you can                                 show the results that you that you can                                 but there will still be me because I                                 don't like the experience at all and you                                 have to monitor the analytics to                                 understand your users without                                 understanding your users then yeah you                                 can still try to create the best engine                                 that you think but still it nobody likes                                 it then you still have the problem the                                 final bit here is that you need to keep                                 improving search by learning from your                                 users and you have to keep improving so                                 it's not one a one-time fix it's                                 something that you have to do and keep                                 on doing but the lesson here would be to                                 create a dedicated multidisciplinary                                 team to solve your search challenge so                                 we have about three minutes left I think                                 pirates or rip it up alright so this is                                 the overview of the ten lessons that we                                 just gave if you would have asked me                                    years ago and this would be the list                                 that I would come up here with ten years                                 later I would've thought you were weird                                 because I would have thought it was                                 purely mainly technical list but over                                 the years you start to really learn that                                 that yeah it's a multidisciplinary                                 effort that you need to take so I really                                 wonder how this list will look like in                                 ten years from now so yeah thank you                                 and do you have any questions                                 back to you Charlie I fantastic thank                                 you so much for your talk guys I must                                 admit my neck is aching somewhat because                                 I was nodding so much all the way                                 through a mind any of those any of your                                 ten questions so yes we do have some                                 questions from the slack we'll actually                                 a point here I mean I'm gonna start here                                 with Dominic's point who found that it                                 could be dangerous to turn to many zero                                 results queries into fuzzy or relaxed                                 queries perhaps you've got something to                                 say about you know the sweet spot for                                 this kind of query relaxation yeah I                                 think I can answer that I think it                                 really depends which is the most common                                 answer to everything of course I think                                 it really depends on your use case I                                 think I saw in the comment that it said                                 like you don't want to give the you                                 users the impression that you always                                 have an answer to everything and I                                 really feel that so I'm not a big fan of                                 fuzzy queries but I think you can try                                 and fix the most fuzziest term fix that                                 one specific and instead of opening up                                 Pandora's box by saying okay we're gonna                                 look through everything buzzing so                                 there's also in there like a multi-step                                 approach you could do by not just                                 turning on fuzzy as a whole but for                                 certain cases try and fix that fuzziness                                 on a small level first so yeah that                                 answers the question yeah this could                                 also well be that you just make your                                     page a bit richer by explaining to them                                 that you don't understand what they're                                 looking for but just give them options                                 to to an amount a query or do something                                 else maybe give them some like top                                 searches or most most both items or                                 whatever but it's and it's something                                 that you can test using analytics                                 fantastic thank you so our next question                                 Ivy rapper who is a report asks online                                 reference interviews I didn't spot that                                 in your talk but she says they had been                                 tried unsuccessfully for decades but                                 maybe with an agent                                 I'm not sure I quite understand the                                 question have you got may-maybe I'm not                                 sure I mean if you're looking into the                                 direction of evaluating search                                 interfaces with with tools maybe looking                                 at people using your product of course                                 those kind of things I'm not sure if                                 that's the way but yeah definitely                                 that's being used as well but it's more                                 for the user experience I think I think                                 it's less used for the relevance okay                                 okay let's move on                                 Zeenat asks wouldn't using the entropy                                 of results to recognize a broad query                                 tell that your results are chaotic rot                                 in the query intent being broad how                                 reliable would this be as a metric                                 that's an interesting way I was I was as                                 the to say buyer you can have this one                                 but yeah could I say four oh four I                                 don't really have an answer to this one                                 I think but I agree                                 I mean it's of course it's tricky I                                 think                                 again you have to be careful but I also                                 think that you have to be a bit sure                                 when when you're doing a user experience                                 where you're directing people to a                                 certain area that you have to be quite                                 sure about it and if you're in if you're                                 in doubts then just give them the                                 results they figure it out themselves or                                 maybe do both maybe just show them the                                 results would also give them ways to to                                 fine-tune their query but I agree it                                 could be it could be tricky to do that                                 yeah and he actually asks Randi web asks                                 how do you actually calculate this                                 category entry well the easy way is is                                 by just counting them and and doing sort                                 of an average so if you have on average                                 you have a category with for instance a                                 thousand products and you have a                                 category with a hundred products then at                                 the moment that you get back results and                                 there are ten from the thousand and one                                 from the hundreds then they're kind of                                 similar so it's in relation to the                                 amount of products that you have in the                                 category you just check the amount                                 products that come out of that category                                 yeah and then you compare the numbers                                 yeah that's the easy way okay                                 and our last question from Carlos how                                 much do you think that phonetics can                                 help solve zero results somebody can                                 solve search issues where you can't                                 spell but can help with zero results                                 yeah I think sometimes it could help                                 because it allows you to find typos that                                 you wouldn't have found if you're not                                 using fuzzy so I think it gives another                                 way but matching with some cases where                                 it actually works well but I've done                                 some research on that in the past and on                                 some big ecommerce clients and I think                                 the downside of e-commerce is that you                                 only search with one term or two terms                                 at max three unless you're really                                 specific into what you're looking for                                 and it could happen that if you have                                 mixed language contents that the                                 phonetics is like you really need to set                                 it up well and it's not a guarantee of                                 fixing these these zero results or                                 improving rankings so I think it can be                                  hard I think there was a talk yesterday                                  that that shed more light on better                                  experiences that you could do without                                  phonetic so I've never seen the real use                                  case phonetic and e-commerce just yet                                  thank you and I'm gonna squeeze one more                                  question in from th Ito what search                                  analytics metrics or kpi's do you prefer                                  to assess search engine quality and app                                  ongoing basis yeah I think I think a few                                  of them we mentioned the zero results of                                  course but that they're just I liked the                                  one with the zero conversion because the                                  zero conversion is of course in                                  e-commerce land is it's always about                                  conversion everything is about                                  conversion and but what makes it                                  interesting is that we actually found                                  some queries that were just giving                                  around like                                                                                                                                   didn't understand that there was like a                                  metadata in there somewhere that just by                                  coincidence resembles the query but it                                  doesn't have anything to do with it and                                  then we didn't find them with the zero                                  results but using the zero conversion we                                  did find them yeah especially if you                                  just start creating your matching and                                  you start to evaluate a new                                  version of your engine the zero                                  conversion really finds that blind spots                                  that you forgot while setting up you're                                  setting up your engine so it's a really                                  nice one to look at fantastic we've got                                  another couple of questions I'm afraid                                  I'm gonna have to refer you to the                                  breakout room which will be running                                  after thought because we have another                                  talk coming up soon for America lesson                                  so I'd like to thank yet Roe and Byron
