Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2016: Daniel Molnar - Migrating a data stack from AWS to Azure #bbuzz
Publication date: 2016-06-11
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2016 #bbuzz
Description: 
	Migrating a full data stack completely relying on AWS services (and a lots of them) to Microsoft Azure does not seem to be an enlightening and funny task. 

How we managed to do it with open sourcing tools as roadkills and what we learnt about the barebone necessities ending up within the sole body of a Raspberry Pi may shock the absolute believers of distributed computing. An adventure in bash, make and SQL with a detour in Moore's law and falling memory prices.

	                              thank you for coming to this talk I try                               to choose some kind of possibly title                               for this one I'm not sure I managed to                               do that properly so like I my name is                               denim owner I work for Microsoft here                               used to work for sexual keener we based                               in Berlin and we've been acquired by                               microsoft as the makers of the wound                               alist and trying to talk you pretty                                condensate it like fast and what we did                                in the last one year so maybe you can                                have some embarrassing questions to meet                                the tiger try to answer at least I'm not                                sure how much you are invested in like                                the judeo-christian religion in general                                and it's pretty slick topic because                                there are people throughout the history                                of human life who claim that they have                                been talking to God and how can one                                imagine like you know talking together                                lacking at the big bearded man like                                coming to you say hey what's up actually                                it's a bit more complicated because it                                seems like that God doesn't really have                                a body so how do you talk to him like                                choice in your head and stuff there's an                                angel was called the Metatron and                                everybody who claims that they talked to                                God they actually talk to the Metatron                                he is the voice of the God so right now                                today I'm trying to be just channeling                                the one and real only message from the                                team I work with so I'm not like a soul                                crazy person in this one we're at least                                through added last year's we were like                                four altogether torsten voice and Benza                                who contributed to this effort and                                presenting to you here today and i have                                to say that i'm standing on the                                shoulders of giants these people made                                this impossible thing possible and so                                i'm going to talk about where we come                                from what we did plan to do how did we                                actually factor a system in flight and                                how to fix it to make it really fly and                                that was like original plan to talk                                about this when i realized that i don't                                have any buzz words in my presentation                                so i added boss version at the                                and maybe there will not be completely                                unrelated to the topic I'm talking so                                like this is what I think about the                                state of the union if you were to any                                other talk on this conference maybe they                                will disagree with what I'm telling you                                but I might be statistically mean and                                there is a pun intended and this one so                                where we come from how big we are how                                small we are what do we roll it it's                                called wounded list it's like a                                Productivity app it like                                           users it's not so it's not big it's kind                                of decent size we're doing it for six                                years with like                                                  actually                                                               one big migration from monolithic reyes                                to like a poly good market service                                approach and we use all kind of stuff on                                the back ends like Scala closure go                                mostly these are the important languages                                and the stuff is running on AWS I                                brought you colorful things this is like                                a it has arrows and color spots this is                                our back-end infrastructure that you                                talk to something that's like web                                service we identify you and they're like                                services in that they're facing you and                                their service that's facing the back end                                is coming back back then and there's                                like the brain that knows everything and                                remove messages in queues so I would say                                it's complicated it's working but it's                                complicated this is like polygon market                                services this is like the map of Poland                                you can see in the background but                                actually these colored circles are all                                different micro services and the size of                                the circle shows you how many of them                                are actually running at the same time                                there's lots of them like they are in                                the numbers of hundreds at a given                                moment and there are lot of different                                ones it's like they're not like the same                                I had to had one tweet in there and I                                presume that if you do run microservices                                you can agree view this finding that                                really running microservices is fun but                                running data on them is even more fun                                the data mostly isn't postgres databases                                 I think there was a time when we had the                                 single                                 is running postgis instance running on                                 AWS and every market service had its own                                 database and there's lots of congruent                                 talks here and there I like their big                                 yeah so we had to deal with this the                                 context of how big it is really in terms                                 of that shuffling things here and there                                 and moving moving things we collect                                 events from client devices we collect                                 events from the backend logs and we try                                 to mirror all production databases we be                                 kind of try to play by the book there's                                 nothing special about it I would say but                                 we ended up as it's in fashion now these                                 days making cell service data for                                 everybody sexually everybody in the                                 company has access to data can deploy                                 things into the data flow and yeah so                                 you can see that                                                       not small not big the compressed logs                                 the output is like almost                                              day so not in the input and we do this                                 with all school technology we have                                 chosen boring technology explicitly we                                 don't use anything else I would say yeah                                 there are some patches here and there                                 but we rely on things that are around                                 like for more than                                                eunuchs bash me crontab sequel why why                                 are we doing this I think we can blame                                 him just him about her he was doing a                                 data science course sometimes back in                                 days and he was following mentioned that                                 ah this idiot is easy you can do it and                                 make you some dependencies and we took                                 his word I've said yeah that's right and                                 we kind of started to like it and we're                                 still sticking to it and it still                                 survives with us because as it's written                                 like it is actually the documentation                                 the code is the documentation it havells                                 dependencies which rise you can test the                                 stuff even on your local machine it's                                 good it's all sprawl ism if you want and                                 you can see in the git log what                                 and was there what does the State of the                                 Union month ago three months ago so if                                 you figure narrow happened six months                                 ago you can see what was the state of                                 the system there's nothing fancy magic                                 about you know this is a makefile the                                 funny stuff star see here there's like a                                 wrong sequel template Ruby oh my god                                 this is a redshift dialect and like                                 cadential sand configs and thighs and                                 scrapes and stuff yeah we use redshift i                                 get to that later we actually made an                                 ETL system out of this blob that's                                 something above make that uses chrome                                 can wait together with bash and we have                                 one magic this using ruby crb scripting                                 language to inject variables and                                 conditionals and like magic and logic                                 into sequel because we have to use what                                 we had use red shift which is real not                                 not like a really smart sequel thingy we                                 had this crazy idea that make a shell                                 around the shell so we can track what's                                 going on so it's actually having a meta                                 shot to be able to provide this                                 information how all the detail is going                                 on it has a small interface in flask                                 also locally testable and it's open                                 source what's out there in open source                                 is the one thing that we run in                                 productions you can trust it yeah I want                                 to talk about like injecting ARB into                                 sequel it looks like this nothing really                                 complicated but it kind of helps a lot                                 in our daily life when we have to move                                 data again interface is not fancy you                                 can see like some kind of gang diagram                                 that how things rolled it's green if                                 it's okay it's red if it's bad and you                                 can investigate all of the steps how did                                 they behave and also we kind of tied in                                 some kind of data quality measurements                                 in there we are obsessed with data                                 quality as far as you got lots of micro                                 services and anything unfair ten time                                 you have to be pretty sure whatever it's                                 in there is the reality so it does on                                 the thigh I mentioned redshift before                                 are running sighs like                                         compressed aggregations not a big not                                 small you don't want to open that file                                 if you talk about ex Adam and we got the                                 two clusters set up when we started to                                 grow we were thinking that maybe we're                                 gonna outgrow red shift in sense of like                                 having all the events in one sequel                                 database we still have all the events we                                 had ever from day                                                     front-end in one table it's working                                 that's why we have a cold storage we're                                 thinking about like having some kind of                                 hybrid approach but then realize that to                                 keep it homogeneous it is much better                                 it's less of a context change if you                                 want to do things and fix things so                                 right now we have a big slow cold                                 storage that has every event what we had                                 ever and we get a hot that's kind of the                                 data warehouse where we move over an                                 aggregation of the events and everything                                 else that we need to do the queries                                 arrows everybody likes arrows I think                                 this is like a pretty simple and default                                 setup it's the state of the union from                                 last December through December so we                                 lock the back end we like a engine X                                 proxy we try to track what's happening                                 on the client side and on in the emails                                 we send out logging thingy goes s                                     have we had a elastic MapReduce job                                 that's kind of crunch the stuff the                                 client side events went to the SQ s aw                                 service why are the SNS thing is such                                 queue and we had to dump this queue and                                 everything end up in s                                                  storage and then again we try to move                                 everything into the hole and then every                                 could everybody can access the things                                 with charred i/o and figure out what's                                 happening making sequel craze even like                                 drag and drop or writing them as you                                 wish so that was a state of union last                                 December                                 I'm not sure you are feeling the fun and                                 excitement now I'm telling you that                                 we're going to move over this whole                                 architecture from AWS to Azure but if I                                 add some more attributes that provide                                 this whole process we had                                               given at any moment of time I think you                                 get the sense that is gonna be fun it                                 also means that we took the business                                 requirements a bit more straight than as                                 usual I'd say that I have mixed feelings                                 about the gardener and garden reports                                 but the concept of total cost of                                 ownership is something I can Y bid so                                 like if you put something in the                                 production you need to be able to                                 maintain it and also the sizing of the                                 team shows you that we can do really                                 like                                                            something fails it has to be resilient                                 stuff ah thank God we didn't have like                                 forensic analysis in our scope so we                                 kind of could skip that part we were                                 more like going the illogical direction                                 and I think the main our Ruby had is                                 like if we can remove something then we                                 will so again just reflect I know if you                                 are familiar with I try to pronounce his                                 name properly much I check love skiing I                                 think he's from the pinboard Fame and he                                 had talked recently it was cold like                                 haunted by data it had some with made                                 some waves in the data community that oh                                 this guy just like doesn't like big data                                 and stuff and he had the concept of the                                 bucolic data landscape you know we had                                 extremes and the data lake and logs and                                 warehouse somehow just like very ruh-roh                                 and my friend and colleague been sent to                                 the time and actually did this this is                                 the bucolic data landscape                                 it's like it's like the Hadoop Jenga you                                 have here everything on top of it you                                 got a data lake and Azure and like data                                 pad last address there's like Luigi up                                 there and the power bi some things we                                 actually built like small animals here                                 and there at a figure that is it's kind                                 of complicated it's really nice we have                                 it printed frame so if you want you can                                 have it I will think about making some                                 kind of a small trivial gaming then and                                 thank you can have the physical copy so                                 we thought that yeah make it simple so                                 praise the Lord James maccon's and what                                 we did is we try to refactor just invite                                 again we have to simplify things we                                 thought that maybe we could survive just                                 removing the AWS specific parts and just                                 try to cram it into a sure and we had to                                 remove unnecessary complications like                                 Hadoop because I just rebuild want to                                 move over any more jobs to a sure that's                                 something you want to do and yeah so you                                 can see that i'm actually just giving it                                 away so what we had an idea is like take                                 what we want think what we have and just                                 clone it in unix on azure                                 so back this was the first state of you                                 and I had I would try to make a small                                 animation here I think I managed so what                                 we did it actually is figure that it's                                 enough to use logs coming from our                                 internal engine X proxy and we made a                                 new service called junior beaver                                 previously our elastic MapReduce job was                                 called mr. beaver because you know it                                 crunches logs sorry and we're like can                                 we do it without Hadoop so we replaced                                 our open scholar with make and pie pie                                 the code is in Python it runs in pi PI                                 and make handles the parallelism and it                                 does what you kind of expect from such a                                 service it's kind of a MapReduce                                 functionality but it's configurable in                                 m-files and we kind of started to                                 believe this saying that big run kills                                 big data instead of having lots of small                                 machines switched on and off on demand                                 we were thinking maybe you could have                                 like this war machine we let more RAM                                 see how it goes and we did our                                 benchmarks on this thingy are elastic                                 MapReduce job had                                                genevieve it has like eight but like an                                 estimable your job is something like                                 this coming up on demand so it's not                                 fair to just compare vcp account i'll                                 say let's compare like the working hours                                 actually reproduce job kind of ran for                                 an hour Jr beaver runs much more but                                 still just like one-tenth of consumption                                 and you can even call it a real time                                 because we can run batches every                                    minutes if you need                                 animation again OOP this was a pain                                 point all the time I have time cues are                                 pretty nice because you can just let                                 throw things on them and you forget                                 about them and you're fine but getting                                 things out of cues that's where the                                 headache starts also the time with the                                 SQ s thinking we actually have to use                                 Ruby to get things out because of our                                 limitations and the time we build thing                                 that was already reliable binding an API                                 but then you know the parallelism kind                                 of was depreciated things going to start                                 a happen and we were thinking that do we                                 need cues we are inspired I think by a                                 guy called Marshall Castillo who had a                                 funny article on hacker news about                                 handling                                                             processes I request in go per second and                                 that to                                                                we just like try to some make something                                 and go and change already existing no GS                                 small even collateral thingy to go and                                 just try to write into files wow what                                 bad things can happen we try to                                 implement some of the fidgety things                                 like you know handing sessions and                                 strict order of events which is hard                                 because as far as we know like the                                 concept of time is something is always a                                 bit tricky if you are working with                                 distributed systems and clients that are                                 either connected or not connected or                                 somewhere in the world and when we had                                 this idea then it makes sense to just                                 like support all kinds of targets                                 meaning you can actually write in two                                 SKUs if you want with this thing you can                                 write in to AWS queues or a jerk use or                                 Azure blob store or s                                                   figure that we can do six million events                                 per minute on a single for PCP you                                 thinking that looks more                                 and you can send protobuf if you are                                 saying but if you are really in a hurry                                 we will try to handle your Jason's also                                 it's going to be slower definitely but                                 life is hard this thing is also open                                 source you can check it out so for the                                 benchmarks vcpu comes our previous                                 roommate rack home homebrew tracking was                                 running on                                                            nowadays Armstrong on one that has four                                 or either to that has two cores this is                                 a different comparison but also make                                 sense you think about how much data you                                 can cram into a queue or how much it can                                 cram into like a file no it's not so no                                 surprise but with the same hardware                                 resources looking a bit much difference                                 on this one and it's not about the                                 machine actually you know Q is accusing                                 you we have to talk a lot here and there                                 while just cram stuff in files and just                                 upload them and then we had that crazy                                 idea again this is a for vcpu so                                 computer is a small thing can we just                                 deploy it on the Raspberry Pi on my                                 desktop like I'm a table like what will                                 happen it worked and we realized that                                 this our pie has more power than we need                                 now for one the list and then we started                                 thinking again this is one kind of thing                                 that consumes lots of resources we got                                 this machine is like client phone                                 tracker we got a machine that runs the                                 etl is like going to make it's like a                                 UNIX bash is not eating much CPU i would                                 say like and we get to that we can put                                 the lock cruncher so you can have a                                 fully featured data stack without a data                                 warehouse for a company the size of us                                 and                                                            investment of                                           I'm just saying and if I want to be like                                 really pathetic which I actually want to                                 be I like this idea because it gives                                 access to data I need a passing                                 capabilities to people who don't have                                 much resources I like that like you are                                 an NGO when you want to track all the                                 gazelles in Africa it's okay you can do                                 it with a small thing like this and this                                 doesn't have any moving parts and you                                 can glue together three of them if some                                 of them fails you don't care that's                                 about the love and dream so how'd it                                 happen actually in reality so the fix-up                                 part so try to change the parts in a way                                 that they should be agnostic where they                                 are running and we try to map them                                 together so we say like okay we forget                                 about SQ has stinky and just use blob                                 storage instead of s                                                  data warehouses redshift we silly                                 evaluate power bi we'll see how we go                                 and we actually remove their own                                 tracking all tracking with a new one                                 that can run both places this is a                                 proper equal sign I would say you're                                 adding all kind of tests we'll do our                                 homework and benchmarks and also i would                                 say that I even like Ezra blob storage                                 more in terms of like the granularity of                                 excess control what can you do with it                                 speed wise it's pretty much the same we                                 spend much more time figuring out how                                 Amazon redshift and azure sequel little                                 house compared because they are                                 different beasts ratchet is coming from                                 more like you know this get an axe and                                 like you / it approach but it's like                                 crack because it's fast it's very good                                 it technically scales Lynn re you happy                                 with it why the secret or else is coming                                 from national enterprise environment                                 where we have all the quirks and jingles                                 and odd nuts that also means that you                                 have like proper stored procedures what                                 you don't really have a night shift                                 that's why for instance we had to use                                 like the ER be code injection with                                 redshift because we wanted to                                 like more complex things later areas                                 could handle it both of them has like                                 good and bad points I would say and they                                 are not the same but we had to figure                                 out how to change small things here and                                 there to base one with other and there's                                 going to be an upcoming benchmarking                                 post from the data warehouse team we                                 work them they're in business Angeles                                 and they just about to release like the                                 pro bird as your data warehouse and                                 they're going to release official                                 numbers but it seems like that they are                                 kind of equal and if you want to do like                                 complex queries the azure data warehouse                                 is even faster than red shift so dueling                                 we want to deploy UNIX thingies in Azure                                 which is like that in theory possible                                 technically possible still we act like                                 fill some gaps in there so we did                                 something that's similar to light s                                 recommend that can move things here and                                 there it's called an azure command it's                                 open source you can use it if you want                                 to and if you're familiar with like the                                 common line pc pole thingy we did                                 something that's very similar is                                 behaving in a similar way like a unix                                 similar way to connect to measure data                                 warehouse and also to the azure sequel                                 server animation time so this is this is                                 the AWS thing they're more like stricter                                 no much hustle approach this is the                                 azure thingy that is kind of same things                                 yeah there's another password called                                 weasel that's the processor but                                 technique that's the same things we had                                 to adopt our sequel approach when                                 changing to their house started to talk                                 about this we had to have different                                 loading strategies and different they                                 have different compression methods they                                 have different sharding indexing whatnot                                 there are pretty good things that you                                 can actually push the throttle if you                                 load kind of real time that I want extra                                 speed and then                                 reloaded he's gonna say let's get it                                 back and yeah it's good to be back to                                 fully feature sequel that really helps                                 it's a lovely thing I would say and                                 again passwords i wanted i want you to                                 get to this point really because i still                                 feel that i didn't have any buzzers up                                 until now maybe you can have a brick                                 much interesting conversation also if                                 you understand what we think about                                 buzzards and how they're coming off                                 three things and they are interconnected                                 definitely I think that we managed to                                 make some kind of prototype for this                                 cloud and all stick later stack you                                 could say it it's not not there on                                 Google yet I think I have yet to see                                 more commercial deployments on Google                                 Cloud if I might say so that's why if                                 you that but even if you look at the                                 Garter diagrams like yeah aw sand as                                 your two options you have so this thing                                 you can deploy either of them or even                                 even deploy in like a hybrid way that                                 you have some things here something's                                 there you don't care when tweeting about                                 this Raspberry Pi experiment of                                 collecting six no resolutions                                                                                                       raspberry there is a answer that this is                                 actually post cloud like you know to                                 think and we were starting to think                                 about that you have this drawer for like                                 screws you know if you're doing makey                                 makey stuff you know that bar and you                                 have to have this drawer with like                                 raspberry PI's that's your inserted form                                 i can say like you know this this row is                                 for one company like this is data stack                                 really and if you look around in Germany                                 you can even find some funny people who                                 will host your Raspberry Pi for free                                 forever I mean maybe you want to help                                 them and give them like six bucks for                                 hosting that but still it's something                                 the realm of possible to make a data                                 stack with that                                 and yeah and redneck data we really i                                 think need that kind of down-to-earth                                 approach um I'm an old guy I'm like I'm                                 becoming                                                           afraid of putting extra layers on top of                                 things and if something is not behaving                                 in a way I kind of like putting another                                 X layer just you know between it and me                                 you can call us lazy and stupid and kind                                 of paranoid it's all true I'm just like                                 trying to survive in an environment of                                 around the stem things I can debug                                 things still because resurrection if you                                 have like                                                               points                                                                   get five days of data in the queue                                 already and that queue has a retention                                 of days x and you know you're you're                                 counting back that's not fun so right i                                 data may be can be based on some kind of                                 this bucolic landscape think i mentioned                                 if i go back so you can enjoy it again                                 so many slides boom so if we can solve                                 it with an ex then let's do it I don't                                 want to let it loose on the measuring                                 side so I think we've spent most of our                                 time benchmarking things and counting                                 beans and making sure that the beans are                                 actually there so I think I err on the                                 side that let's measure it with a                                 micrometer and then just like / it to                                 the next and let's figure if you can                                 still keep the lives like we kind of                                 started out with this set up in a way                                 that we should be fine for us at its                                 scale and I think we were the most                                 surprised ones to see that actually it                                 kind of could grew with us                                 another picture for you mmm so yes this                                 is a fairy if you ever design something                                 remember this image image this is a                                 fairy this is not a bridge this is a                                 fairy actually it's in Germany but I                                 like engineers I truly like engineers                                 sometimes I feel that maybe you can                                 simplify things a bit and this one is in                                 production thank you I hope you have                                 some embarrassing questions I cannot                                 answer please yeah okay so first i'm                                 also lazy stupid but that's like with                                 most developed engineer system engineer                                 system administrators in the past now                                 also turning                                                           yeah so that's okay but i have to a                                 practical question yes you have rsyslog                                 yes in your diagram that is you ever had                                 problems with them it was we had exactly                                 been processing engine X logs and they                                 had like around                                                        looks and at some point I start blocking                                 out completely and like blogging one                                 quarter of our instances like                                 we have problems Oliver I think that's                                 why we try to minimize the number of the                                 moving parts and that's why we kind of                                 started to get lost of the thing and                                 figure that if you have this engine X                                 proxy we can just like clamp on that and                                 get data because we have problems for I                                 think first we only started to use ours                                 is log we really had to MapReduce things                                 because things are all over the place so                                 we slowly and finally just face it up                                 there's no good news for you joy I                                 interesting talk how do you find the                                 cost comparing of as you overseas amazon                                 good question sometimes we felt light is                                 going to be too expensive but figure                                 that they are pretty aggressive and                                 pricing and I liked it that's why we try                                 to help them with benchmarks and say                                 like hey this is what I can get a needle                                 yes for two bucks this cost like four                                 can we fix it and the good thing is that                                 the first has the latest measurement                                 what we did run on redshift versus data                                 warehouse data warehouse is cheaper be                                 like thirty percent so I was like happy                                 how is how is the controlling of that is                                 a stuff do you need really need windows                                 boxes or do you can do it from poor unix                                 or mac environment I medical guarding                                 and all this normally not normal stuff                                 to deploy things and manage things                                 really good question ah I forgot to                                 mention this with for instance our whole                                 team except the Mac except the windows                                 developers were originally working on                                 mcintoshes like like everybody's these                                 days we start to have like more in those                                 things but for instance the data stack                                 is fully in Unix so there is hope and                                 it's working in its production as a                                 question is how it's about resources we                                 we could we work on a little bit larger                                 scale than you we have an an hour tries                                 and Amazon a lot of resource problems we                                 have to wait forever to get hosts or                                 even we don't get our classes started                                 because they're running out of resources                                 so give us                                                            this they said probably you can start at                                 that time so we have to ate every                                 big class around with them to get to get                                                                                                       terms what you think about it a cloud                                 yeah I think we're trying to mitigate                                 this with having kind of a breeding                                 breeder you kind of start to have a bit                                 of an overload this one kind of start to                                 wake things sooner than they are needed                                 but they had these problems both on AWS                                 on Azure it's sometimes it's just like                                 hard really so we try to get around this                                 in this way that we try to have some                                 resources waiting to be deployed and I                                 kind of I don't totally see you but I                                 kind of seen your eyes that with the                                 size of your needs it could cost a lot                                 of money to have something just sit                                 there in preparation                                 exactly that is our problem and as a                                 question is about the object store we                                 faced with as                                                            so basically if you want to heaven                                 cluster which has                                                 parallel running and writing to as                                      get throttled so it doesn't doesn't work                                 you have to do this hashing on the first                                 pass of your sangs set it said scales                                 then you can write it but if you want to                                 get a directory listing and want to get                                 it work with high if it's a nightmare                                 okay as the question is do we have on                                 Google's drawers similar problems that                                 you have to hash your names the                                 benchmarks we didn't run with Azure blob                                 store was like not the premium offering                                 but like generic one and the generic one                                 was a bit faster and more reliable than                                 the last three and i would expect the                                 premium on with some jariabek easy thing                                 is that could live up to the promises                                 but I try to get you somebody who is                                 much more bad words in this one second                                 talk to Sam I feel it's a bit better                                 okay because this is something which                                 right now puts a lot of headache to us                                 okay in terms of scaling                                 why did you have to move to a jury in                                 the first place yeah good question I                                 think this was part like you know we're                                 part of this big mothership now we                                 should use those resources but another                                 hand I think it was kind of we like                                 crazy things that yeah let's try it if                                 it's possible and and it was possible                                 and it's really good to be a proper                                 customer inside a company saying like                                 and it's really good to hear that they                                 try to answer these questions another                                 question do you run production work                                 loads on raspberries I kind of missed                                 missed that point we didn't put actual                                 production on there but our testing is                                 pretty ok so we have a test switch for                                 actually tested is included in the most                                 of thing you can figure it out by                                 yourself but it can run production load                                 exactly and even the resident raspberry                                 benchmark we had and I yes it is yes six                                 million was the four vcpu and raspberry                                 was the                                                               the raspberry benchmark was actually                                 running away that dress was technically                                 on my desk so it is connected to a                                 router and like so it's not in the cloud                                 at all and the last question is well in                                 all the buzz words I haven't seen docker                                 you have plans to his daughter                                 I'd rather not comment on this issue                                 I think two gigs ram it took weeks to                                 geeks okay so on the rasp I topic again                                 yeah I did I did some benchmark of kafka                                 non-res pie so we passed the like                                        messages per second through rasp eyes                                 what was your limitation there was at                                 cpu or ram it was Ram okay yeah far as                                 it was just networking so and I                                        the for storing the locks to disk so it                                 could be possible to get even faster                                 yeah I mean like I still kind of                                 consider the raspberry PI's the                                 Commodore                                                              chosen as the target but if you go out                                 in the market you can buy something                                 that's like                                                            and cost like I don't know                                            like these small boxes that good very                                 impressive talk Thanks any more                                 questions no I think he's lunch thank                                 thank you
