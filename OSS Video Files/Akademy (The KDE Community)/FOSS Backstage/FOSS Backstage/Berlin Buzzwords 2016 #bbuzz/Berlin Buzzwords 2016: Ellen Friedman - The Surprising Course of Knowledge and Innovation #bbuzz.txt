Description: 
	Distributed Systems are a complex topic. There's abundant research about it but sometimes it is hard for a beginner to know where to start. I would like to outline the main concepts of distributed systems, so the interested person can have a clear path on how to start their own research as well.

In this talk I will review the different models: asynchronous vs. synchronous distributed systems; message passing vs shared memory communication; failure detectors and leader election problems; consensus and different kinds of replication.

I will also review a series of books on distributed systems in order to recommend the best one according to the topics we would like to learn about, or the problems we would like to solve.

The goal of the talk is to set a good foundation for people interested in learning more about distributed systems

Navy his name                                is Matthew Maury when he was a fairly                                young man he injured his leg he could no                                longer go to see the Navy gave him a                                desk job and surprisingly that's when                                the real adventure in his life began                                because he was very innovative thinker                                he discovered that there were boxes and                                boxes of old books old captain's logs                                while the captain's weren't old but the                                books were so when people go to see the                                captain would take measurements this                                were actually time series data that                                measured maybe the temperature air                                temperature water temperature speed of                                the winds whatever what they had for                                breakfast and if that was enough rum so                                it wasn't very consistent data and they                                would turn in these books at the end of                                the trip somebody would throw it in a                                box and they forget it so what Maury                                realized is there were hundreds and                                hundreds of these maybe thousands i                                don't know each log had very little                                value but you realize if he                                painstakingly with his team extracted by                                hand all of the data that was valuable                                and aggregated that data you have a                                really tremendously valuable resource so                                they produce these winds and currents                                charts that had enormously valuable                                navigational information for shipping                                routes all around the world and when                                they first published this the impact of                                it was basically nothing because people                                 didn't appreciate the value of that data                                 so it is important to learn to                                 communicate what you do if you're                                 working at an open source project you                                 build it you also need to build a user                                 community and help people understand why                                 that tool may be useful to them what                                 happened here is that one ship captain                                 his name was Captain Jackson he was                                 doing a sail down from excuse me on the                                 coast                                 the Americas down for Baltimore to Rio                                 de Janeiro and back he used one of these                                 charts he shaved                                                         and                                                                  into port                                                            notice they're very competitive now                                 everybody wanted one of the charts                                 here's amore was really smart he wanted                                 better data so he made a uniform                                 template and in order to get one of his                                 charts somebody had to go collect better                                 data in a uniform way turn in the                                 template and they would get her chart                                 had a huge impact on navigation so the                                 lessons that you can learn from this the                                 main                                                                  idea of innovation if you look past the                                 normal things that you think about you                                 may discover a big idea and also a                                 lesson that you all know already is that                                 there can be huge value in an aggregate                                 of data that smaller data sets don't                                 have on their own now I just came from                                 strata in London and I saw this big                                 poster up from Sherlock Holmes's quote                                 it's a capital mistake to theorize                                 before one has data I agree with that I                                 also want to point out there's some                                 pretty big mistakes you can make after                                 you have data as well if you don't do it                                 right so the next part of my talk is                                 called undiscovery the cure for scurvy                                 how many people in here have heard of                                 scurvy yes a lot a few a few people                                 raise their hands well scurvy is fairly                                 horrible disease is called caused by a                                 scarcity a lack of vitamin C vitamin C                                 is actually asked Orbach acid it's                                 really a terrible disease but it can                                 easily be prevented or cured by eating                                 fresh foods that have vitamin C                                 especially citrus watercress even meet                                 to some extent if it's unprocessed meat                                 so we've known that for a long time even                                 from ancient time people thought this                                 might be true but a British doctor named                                 Lind in                                                          controlled experiments he was able to                                 actually show that it looked like fresh                                 citrus really contributed to curing or                                 preventing scurvy he published this in a                                 fairly famous a document at the time a                                 lot of people heard about it now it                                 wasn't until much later in                                           people could actually isolate what it                                 was in citrus fruit vitamin c ascorbic                                 acid that was a cure but they knew that                                 eating fresh citrus                                 would take care of you and certainly by                                                                                                        to have fresh lemon juice this was a                                 tremendous advantage to the British Navy                                 because they could stay out at sea                                 longer they were healthier this one on                                 for years and years it's part of how                                 they really dominated the disease for a                                 long time so it was somewhat surprising                                 that in                                                                  a long polar expedition record in his                                 journal that people were dying from                                 scurvy how sad it was that nobody had                                 any idea how to cure or prevent it what                                 should we conclude from this is                                 something happened so you can read about                                 this there was an interesting blog that                                 was based on this book called the worst                                 journey in the world talking about this                                 Scott's polar expedition but basically                                 what had happened in between is in                                      the British Navy made a change and what                                 they changed is they had been using                                 lemons mostly from Italy that was                                 expensive they decided they could use                                 limes they thought was the acidity that                                 is what you wanted and the lines are                                 more acidic than lemons they figured                                 that would be better and then they                                 wanted to get lines from the West Indies                                 that was land that they control that was                                 better for them so started using and                                 it's easier to use bottle lime juice                                 than fresh juice or lines or limits so                                 that was a change that they made and why                                 was that an issue is because it turns                                 out that this bottle lime juice was                                 ineffective against scurvy but it also                                 turns out nobody noticed what should you                                 conclude from that okay so here's what                                 was going on it was this bizarre set of                                 little decisions each of which wasn't                                 totally crazy at the time but they                                 weren't tested in a disciplined way                                 people didn't have the consider                                 alternative explanations so what                                 happened is they move from limits two                                 limes that goes to twenty-five percent                                 as much ascorbic acid vitamin C it also                                 turns out that vitamin C is                                 sensitive to air to oxidation exposure                                 to heat and exposure to copper they made                                 this in these big vats heat of the VATS                                 they exposed it to air and then piped it                                 through copper there wasn't much a                                 vitamin C in there to start with and                                 they put it in bottles so by the time                                 they bottled it there really wasn't much                                 of anything there there was a mistake                                 that they made in making that change you                                 would think right away however they                                 would notice that people would get sick                                 and die from scurvy they didn't so what                                 else happened is bad set of coincidences                                 they're actually doing something right                                 they let go of their old idea in the                                 response to new new data but they didn't                                 do it in a careful and disciplined way                                 so this is just unfortunate that right                                 about the same time steamships speeded                                 up travel sailing ships were more                                 efficient thanks to Maurice charts and                                 so ships didn't stay out at sea is long                                 and it turns out you only need a very                                 small amount of vitamin C and it takes a                                 very long time to develop the symptoms                                 so people kept treating themselves as                                 lime juice thinking they're okay and                                 they weren't until they started taking                                 these very long polar expeditions and so                                 at that point another mistake was made                                 which is basically to think you know                                 something change fine they knew that but                                 they throughout the entire idea of                                 citrus and kind of went back to square                                 one so the lesson to take away from that                                 is when something changes look for what                                 changed and look for alternative                                 explanation very quickly I'll tell you                                 because like I'm not doing people of my                                 timing here but I'll tell you that                                 there's a modern laboratory story i was                                 actually i'm actually not trained in in                                 the field of computing originally i was                                 biochemist have a doctorate in                                 biochemistry and i did research                                 molecular biology a friend of mine who                                 has her hands a technician in a lab                                 called me one day almost in tears she                                 was doing an absolutely standard                                 procedure she done it over and over and                                 suddenly one day it didn't work that's                                 surprising but not that surprising she                                 did what you're supposed to do which is                                 repeat the procedure she did that many                                 times but has still failed at this point                                 repeated it more times and began to                                 consider another career path a better                                 choice would have been for her to ask                                 what changed well she was asking what                                 change but it didn't seem like anything                                 and change was doing the same way every                                 time and she keeping very good record so                                 she knew she was doing the same why                                 when it appears that nothing changed but                                 clearly something broke what you need to                                 do is to remember that physics works                                 don't abandon that and look again and                                 ask yourself what possibly could have                                 changed in this case one of the reagents                                 she was using was from a new lot a new                                 group of reagents and it turned out that                                 reagent was contaminated so in fact she                                 wasn't doing anything different her                                 starting material was different it took                                 her a long time to discover that when                                 things break ask yourself what changed                                 last hopefully you've taken good enough                                 records that you can tell ask yourself                                 what changed when did it last work and                                 you know trust that there has to be                                 something that's different and it has to                                 make sense so what does this have to do                                 with you and the kind of world work that                                 you do came up with this one example                                 somebody does something they've                                 developed something and the program is                                 working fine they go into production and                                 now it doesn't work everybody's heard                                 anybody say what but it worked on my                                 machine so clearly what they need to do                                 is ask themselves what changed what                                 could possibly be different and                                 obviously there are a number of                                 different things that might change in                                 the environment that's certainly a place                                 to start when things appear to break you                                 think you're doing the same thing you've                                 done before consider alternative                                 explanations here's a quick story as i                                 said i used to be a biochemist i was on                                 a plane going to a big biochemistry                                 conference man sitting next to me worked                                 for a company that made pet food I                                 worked in academic research that was a                                 very different world for me so he's                                 telling me stories about how they do                                 biochemistry they were making a new                                 synthetic flavor for dog food and he                                 said one of the challenges is that you                                 make it but then is it better than the                                 old flavor well do dogs like it better                                 so here's how he did the test he                                 basically did a bee testing they would                                 take old the old flavor about old dog                                 food but the old flavor of dog food put                                 in a bowl to put the new flavor in a                                 bowl put the bowls down on the floor                                 opened the door and let a dog in                                 basically they asked a dog now this                                 wasn't a real big sample size but they                                 did repeat the test a number of times                                 and they just looked to see which flavor                                 which dog food to the dog prefer and                                 they did the test over and over and                                 greatly to their disappointment the dog                                 preferred the old food                                 so that all right the new flavor is no                                 good they went back tried it again                                 synthesized a new flavor do the same                                 sort of test again will the dog prefer                                 the old food or the new food again they                                 let the dog in very disappointing the                                 dog goes to the old food they start                                 thinking maybe the food flavor they had                                 originally is as good as you can do                                 until it finally occurred to somebody to                                 reverse the position of the bowls and it                                 turns out every single time the bought                                 dog went to the bowl on the left so                                 basically they thought that they were                                 testing the dogs preferences for flavor                                 they were testing the dogs preferences                                 for the position of the bowls now last                                 year at hadoop summit in san jose my                                 co-author ted dining and I were doing a                                 book signing for two titles that we'd on                                 her machine learning series want a                                 recommendation one an anomaly detection                                 we let people when they came up to get a                                 book choose which one they wanted and I                                 was very surprised to see that most                                 people were choosing the one on                                 recommendation and it mainly surprised                                 me because we happen to have a lot of                                 people there who work for telecoms or                                 four banks I would have thought to be                                 interested in the one on an anomaly                                 detection until I suddenly remembered                                 night leaned over and whispered dog food                                 to Ted we took the stacks and we                                 reversed them and we discovered that                                 data scientists prefer the books on the                                 right so when you when you're doing                                 testing when you're doing a V testing or                                 any kind of testing do your testing do                                 it carefully keep good records but also                                 make sure that the thing that you're                                 testing is what you think you're testing                                 it's not always true consider                                 alternative explanations how does this                                 feed into the world that you live in                                 well take one example and this is                                 actually again this really happens the                                 story I heard from Ted Dunning a long                                 time ago he was building a                                 recommendation engine for an online                                 video streaming service and he built the                                 model and when they first used as input                                 data for the models clicks basically                                 here's a title how many people would                                 click on a particular movie the                                 recommender wasn't working well you                                 start trying to tweak the algorithm or                                 whatever which is very frustrating but                                 then he had the idea to not use that and                                 instead to use who views the first                                    seconds of                                 of a video suddenly the recommender                                 worked really really well and so this is                                 a like the dog food case in the first                                 case you're really testing how well                                 people like the title of the movie not                                 whether they actually like that video in                                 the second case you're actually testing                                 their preference through the videos so                                 it's one of those cases where you're not                                 testing what you think you're testing                                 another one if any of you have done                                 modeling you know the danger of having a                                 target leak this is one where there was                                 a classifier built for news groups and                                 in order to do testing oh I'm sorry they                                 built this they tried it out and it                                 worked really well in order to do the                                 testing basically want to separate                                 training data from your evaluation data                                 so they just took the single data set                                 and took every other article even number                                 articles for training odd number for                                 testing and it turned out it worked I                                 mean that's a good logical way to build                                 a kind of matched excuse me training and                                 data and evaluation set so it worked                                 really well and that's good news except                                 it worked really really really well and                                 so it really worked too well to be true                                 so you want to do a little alternative                                 testing and say oh I'm that's great but                                 maybe not so great it turns out many of                                 the articles were articles that were                                 basically repeated and had a slight                                 modification or correction and so when                                 you separate them this way you have too                                 much overlap one way to test that out                                 was to actually separate them in terms                                 of earlier later articles and at that                                 point the classifier collapsed if it's                                 too good to be true it's probably not                                 true consider alternative explanations                                 quick a moment here and we'll go into                                 the whole story because running out of                                 time but anybody in here I studied                                 chemistry french chemist Lavoisier we go                                 back to the                                                           astounding discoveries about what                                 happens when combustion happens and he                                 did this really by taking very careful                                 measurements of the weight of the                                 reagents and the products and in these                                 processes but he didn't see old                                 containers so he was weighing the solid                                 and the gases and then testing what                                 happened and from this he drew an                                 interesting set of conclusions he was                                 able to figure out that this mysterious                                 substance called flow just on that                                 people thought within a substance and                                 in a way when the substance was heated                                 in fact didn't exist he was able to get                                 data that supported an idea that was                                 already there which is the conservation                                 of matter and in along the way he                                 actually discovered and named oxygen I                                 puts us in to remind myself to remind                                 you that careful measurements                                 measurements monitoring metrics they may                                 not sound super exciting but the really                                 powerful techniques if you do them well                                 you do them often you keep really good                                 records and then you take time to step                                 back and think about what they're                                 telling you you can learn a lot from                                 that now lately I think can talk a lot                                 about streaming data I feel like that's                                 you know the most surprising thing about                                 my talk today is it wasn't about flink                                 and it wasn't about Kafka which makes it                                 unusual so of course I have to talk                                 about streaming data a little                                          just finished another book called                                 streaming architecture and one of the                                 things that we talked about is that if                                 you use a messaging system that has the                                 right kinds of capabilities which by the                                 way we think apache Kafka's are really                                 good one oops now I'm back to Kafka and                                 map are has a new messaging system                                 that's actually built into its platform                                 it uses the kafka API it has goes a                                 little beyond what Kafka does but we                                 think both of those are a great way to                                 approach these kinds of architecture now                                 what happens is you basically have                                 decoupled the producers and the                                 consumers and part of why that's                                 important the messages delivered it can                                 be used right away it doesn't have to be                                 used right away consumer can be offline                                 online it means you can add consumers                                 and as you add consumers to consume that                                 same streaming data here I have is an                                 odd kind of reverse way of drawing a                                 piece as a piece of a larger diagram                                 because this is out of the book but                                 these cylinders are actually looking at                                 places where you use Kafka or map our                                 streams those are the the messaging the                                 cues and the end of this was gained from                                 a video example the thumbnail extractor                                 is a service it's running but besides                                 just the uploads in the out put the                                 thumbs you can have various checkpoints                                 exceptions you can do a lot of                                 monitoring a lot of metrics it's very                                 easy to add in those new consumers and                                 by doing that you don't interrupt what's                                 happening with the other consumers are                                 that means it's easier to have metrics                                 at more stages of what you do it means                                 you can have more fine-grain monitoring                                 and metrics very very powerful thing to                                 do in a shift and how people are working                                 so we think that's going to you know                                 help a lot with people making                                 discoveries about how their systems are                                 working metrics metrics metrics okay                                 this isn't quite about measuring but                                 it's another good lesson in this and                                 this is also a real world example a                                 friend who was head of security for a                                 bank did a kind of unusual thing but he                                 saved the headers for all website                                 request he wasn't looking for any                                 particular thing he just wanted to save                                 that data in case it was important and                                 he saved it for a long period of time it                                 turns out as people tried to attack the                                 website you get through the security                                 barriers he was able to detect anomalies                                 in the pattern of the headers they                                 happen to be slightly different for the                                 attackers now this isn't something he                                 could know our priority he needed to                                 look for he just saved as much data as                                 he could to document what was happening                                 in case you would need to look back at                                 it and in fact he did and he found this                                 this pattern he was able to stock                                 basically stop these attackers at the                                 perimeter so keeping a careful history                                 of data paid off the wazee a and in fact                                 with the help of his wife kept very                                 careful records that's part of how they                                 could look back and make these                                 discoveries it's also a different sort                                 of lesson here and this is one of the                                 things that's beginning to change in                                 this modern world of big data is that                                 you may say things that you don't know                                 at the time are going to be useful later                                 it's really helpful it turns out in                                 medical research is is important to as                                 people do retrospective studies they've                                 taken all these case studies from                                 patients later as they began to                                 understand what is going on they say I                                 wish from two years ago we had recorded                                 this information you don't always know                                 so you don't just record the single                                 thing you already know is going to be                                 important keep data you don't know what                                 will be important later and it turns out                                 this is again becoming increasingly easy                                 to do so back on the topic of these new                                 tools for streaming data if you have a                                 messaging system                                 it has is able to do very low latency it                                 has very good performance even with                                 persistence older systems you traded off                                 performance or persistence but with                                 Kafka with map our streams that's not                                 true you get both so this means you not                                 only deliver data for some sort of low                                 latency or real time or near real-time                                 application but you also have a                                 replayable stream that becomes a history                                 and auditable log and that can be useful                                 in a lot of different ways you can                                 configure in both of those systems and                                 Kafka and map our streams you can                                 configure the time to live so you can                                 have these messages last almost not at                                 all get rid of them you can have them                                 basically set to infinity for time to                                 live and you've persisted the message                                 you can go back you could save longer                                 periods of messages weeks months years                                 and actually be able to look back and                                 that becomes a very powerful tool for                                 certain kinds of investigation now I                                 didn't realize that people had thought                                 of this but we did a talk at a flank                                 meet up last week in London and in                                 talking about this idea of keeping a                                 long-term replayable log a couple of                                 people said but you couldn't save that                                 much day I mean that's not practical you                                 can just save short amount of data and I                                 realized if you are thinking in terms of                                 coffee used to the idea that you have a                                 topic you have partitions of that topic                                 for load balancing and so forth but as                                 of now the topic lives on a machine it's                                 a little bit different so we were                                 thinking in terms of map our streams                                 it's a little different in streams                                 because the partitions and the topic are                                 actually distributed all the way across                                 the cluster so it opens up this                                 possibility of saving years of data                                 really not a problem not important for                                 all applications but in some                                 applications it's useful so let's do a                                 quick summary I think some of these                                 lessons you can learn from from all-time                                 mistakes and some some recent mistakes                                 and some things people have done well                                 take time to think again it sounds                                 trivial but it has huge payoff find                                 essential concepts essential concepts in                                 what you do or what somebody else does                                 is not the same as generalizations a                                 generalization doesn't have much meaning                                 at all you find the core of what really                                 matters and that helps you think about                                 how systems work and how                                 they can work in new ways things do                                 break when they do ask when they work to                                 last ask what changed if it appears that                                 nothing changed and they're broken                                 obviously something changed look back                                 further consider alternative                                 explanations make sure you're testing                                 what you think you're testing consider                                 alternative explanations when it's too                                 good to be true I suggest that you                                 consider alternative explanations                                 remember if you measure more keep                                 metrics you can really change the way                                 you can fine tune what you're doing and                                 you can change the way you can look back                                 in history and see what happened and                                 that can be a very powerful tool and                                 also you may want to save data that at                                 the time you're not consciously aware                                 exactly how are you going to use it                                 we've written a number of these short                                 books O'Reilly sells them if you want to                                 read just a PDF manpower makes them

                read the PDF our most recent book                                 streaming data we have a few copies and                                 we'll do a little mini book signing and                                 give some away tomorrow I'm not sure                                 exactly when I have to look at the                                 schedule the co-author Ted dunning is                                 doing a talk today at                                                  he's going to say at the talk you know                                 when but my guess is it will be in the                                 morning and I don't know the exact time                                 if you want to read the book online this                                 is actually available not as well it is                                 as a PDF but you can read it just as an                                 active book online if you go to this to                                 this link a quick plug please do support                                 women in technology but I also want to                                 say I love to see these groups who are                                 women are getting together and they're                                 looking at the issues of how can we get                                 more women into open source how do we                                 get more women in engineering this is a                                 topic I think should be of interest to                                 people not to women not just groups of                                 women talking not just female speakers                                 coming not just female panels would like                                 to see groups of men and women get                                 together and talk about how to encourage                                 more women in these fields thank you                                 very very much for having me here and                                 there's my contact information okay on                                 time                                 thank you so much it's very
