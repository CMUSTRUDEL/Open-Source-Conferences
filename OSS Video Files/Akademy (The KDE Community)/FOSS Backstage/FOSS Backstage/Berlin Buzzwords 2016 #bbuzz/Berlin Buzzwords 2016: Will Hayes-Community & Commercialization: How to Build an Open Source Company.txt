Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2016: Will Hayes-Community & Commercialization: How to Build an Open Source Company
Publication date: 2016-06-11
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2016 #bbuzz
Description: 
	Many companies tout themselves as “open source,” offering support for popular tools and technologies. But professional services alone don’t typically produce the kind of revenue required for long term business success. 

So what does it take to build a profitable and healthy open source company? In this session, Will Hayes, CEO of Lucidworks — the company built on and around Apache Lucene and Solr — will share how business success need not come at the expense of the open source community’s integrity. 

Using Lucidworks as a case study Hayes will explain the power of specificity in driving both revenue and committer happiness, exploring why open source companies should avoid commercializing product features with broad, cross-industry appeal, such as security, management and monitoring. These are fundamental features and monetizing them will harm the integrity of the open source community.

	                              okay well thank you all very much this                               is um the the saloon so if you were                               looking for the club it's actually the                               other other room over there I'm will                               Hayes I'm the CEO of lucid works                               lucidworks were the commercial entity                               behind leucine and solar also the                               creators of a lucid works fusion                               platform which we'll talk about quite a                                bit I've been with loosen'd works for                                about three and a half years now and                                prior to that I was part of the founding                                team at a company called spunk which you                                might be familiar with as well so kind                                of seeing a whole spectrum of kind of                                commercial and open source technology                                and what we thought would be interesting                                to do here today is sort of give you                                some background on the evolution of the                                company some of the things that we've                                learned over time in terms of building a                                community building a company around the                                community and some kind of best                                practices or lessons learned around                                commercialization so as I said Lucy                                works as the company behind leucine and                                solar and so what that means is that we                                drive a lot of the development so about                                seventy to eighty percent of what goes                                into the code base is coming from our                                employees we employ about forty percent                                of the active committers that are in the                                community around the technology and we                                tend to act as a sort of a focal point                                for the community as a whole with other                                people who are contributing other                                companies that are sort of collaborating                                kind of helping sort of drive a lot of                                those activities we end up doing things                                like sponsoring the revolute all or                                evolution for example a lot of the                                marketing that goes on the webinars web                                development and other sort of things                                that we can contribute back into in and                                around the technology solar if you're                                not familiar is used by about ninety                                percent of the fortune                                                of the most widely deployed open-source                                search engines that's out there today                                primarily a document store there's other                                technologies that are out there things                                MongoDB elasticsearch to also sort of                                built or derivatives from leucine we                                look at a lot of more kind of primary                                search use cases so things like your                                e-commerce shopping sites content                                management anytime we're serving up sort                                of documents highly unstructured data                                typically where solar plays within the                                enterprise one of the things that we                                pride                                selves on is that you probably use solar                                every day whether you know it or not if                                you're using something like the iCloud                                you're working with companies like                                Bloomberg like AOL eBay Amazon and so on                                there's also a massive ecosystem in and                                around solar so we're the primary search                                interface into the Hadoop platforms that                                are out there today the commercial                                platform so Cloudera Hortonworks and map                                are and as a company we work very                                closely with with these organizations to                                help kind of coordinate the efforts                                coordinate a lot of the features and                                functionality that go into the                                technology that can power a lot of these                                sort of next-generation use cases so                                what I want to talk about today is                                really you know how do you kind of                                strike that balance between community                                and commercialization because both are                                incredibly important and I think as most                                people know that have been around the                                industry for a long time that these open                                source projects especially the more                                popular ones typically don't get there                                independent of a company or an                                organization that's supporting it so in                                most cases if you go back to things like                                Linux and red hat right and then a lot                                of the Hadoop evolution that you've seen                                today the platforms that are being                                widely deployed today they're typically                                backed by an organization whose primary                                focus is in driving the development                                driving the direction providing the                                marketing support providing that kind of                                push if you will to really move the                                 technology forward but that being said                                 there's a lot of advantages that you get                                 from this Community Development both as                                 an end user or an implementer of the                                 technology or as a commercial                                 organization like ourselves it's really                                 the diversity that comes in the                                 different types of viewpoints the use                                 case is the test cases the cultures in                                 which we get deployed and so being a                                 search engine obviously we work across                                 multiple languages multiple types of                                 inputs and those types of things and so                                 we benefit greatly as a technology                                 platform from all of this collaboration                                 that goes into it there's different                                 models as we know so just because                                 something is open source doesn't                                 necessarily mean that it sort of follows                                 either the Apache standard whether it                                 comes from governance or even a                                 licensing model where you can sort of                                 package and redeploy so we'll look at                                 some of the pros and cons of                                 of different approaches in general as                                 I'm sure most people at this conference                                 know you know open source it means that                                 there's a level of transparency you                                 typically have access to the code you                                 can modify the code depending on                                 licensing and we won't get into that in                                 too much detail here you can package you                                 can modify you can ship you can really                                 leverage it as part of your technology                                 stack the Apache foundation brings                                 another element to this and that's                                 governance and governance has its pros                                 and cons in some ways you know it can                                 create some inefficiencies in order to                                 sort of drive things like roadmaps and                                 features forward but it really means                                 that there's a stabilization around the                                 code base and if you think about solar                                 and the ecosystem that's around it a lot                                 of that adoption comes from that                                 confidence that these organizations have                                 that the code base will remain steady                                 that things like backwards compatibility                                 or thought about in a very kind of                                 thoughtful and slow manner and that the                                 roadmap is moving consistently with the                                 foundation of the project so that can                                 kind of give a peace of mind and as an                                 organization it's something that we                                 cherish in terms of what it really means                                 around the way that we control changes                                 within our technology the inputs and the                                 collaborations that go into that now                                 there can be you know some disadvantages                                 to this model as well like I said if                                 you're familiar with splunk it's it's                                 sort of the other side of the spectrum                                 kind of where I started out in data                                 platforms and that was you know highly                                 commercialized very expensive very                                 proprietary and so there are some                                 advantages to that in terms of the way                                 that we controlled the codebase the                                 decisions that we could make the pace in                                 which we could drive changes we could                                 decide you know release to release if we                                 wanted to dramatically shift things like                                 architecture and those kinds of things                                 but you know the cons that can kind of                                 come with this other model tend to be                                 around velocity right and so with                                 collaboration comes sometimes a lot of                                 difference in opinions and within the                                 apache foundation in particular you know                                 you have the right to sort of prevent                                 certain things from going forward                                 without having sort of further                                 discussion and again the advantages of                                 this is that we get a lot of district we                                 get a lot of diversity within those                                 inputs and we get a lot of confidence in                                 the way that changes are being governed                                 in the way that the direction of the                                 technology is going so there's not a lot                                 of surprises which is something                                 important especially                                 with search right where you're building                                 this foundational technology which                                 typically isn't being delivered is just                                 the vanilla service but we're building                                 on top of this things that are powering                                 our business things like customer                                 service ecommerce all the way into some                                 of the more kind of surveillance and                                     types of applications where research as                                 a paradigm really which provides                                 unstructured natural access back into                                 your technology so within the apache                                 foundation you know one of the things                                 that again we really benefit from is                                 sort of keeping things we call like on                                 the rails right there's a lot of                                 transparency there's a lot of                                 collaboration we're not able to even as                                 an organization who sponsors and puts a                                 lot of sort of monetary support behind                                 the project lucidworks doesn't have the                                 power just to come in and say you know                                 what we're just going to kind of take                                 this thing in another direction we're                                 going to sort of rip it out from                                 underneath people and so with that that                                 collaboration and that confidence comes                                 in and we're very fortunate as an                                 organization because a lot of larger                                 organizations then collaborate with us                                 and so we get to work with companies                                 like Cloudera we work with companies                                 like IBM and even in the commercial                                 space sort of the non technology sector                                 if you will I look at companies like                                 Bloomberg who actually contribute a                                 tremendous amount of knowledge and                                 information back into the project and so                                 as a company who's sort of the sponsor                                 of this you know we benefit pretty                                 heavily from that other companies that                                 apply this model companies like datastax                                 with the Cassandra project companies                                 like Hortonworks with with their                                 distribution of Hadoop and we'll look at                                 some of the models that you can take to                                 market across these different                                 organizations and like I said a lot of                                 what we want to reflect on here are the                                 things that we've learned from both the                                 pros and the cons and why we've sort of                                 evolved our business over the years to                                 adapt to some of these challenges now                                 you take the non Apache model where open                                 source becomes more of a distribution                                 mechanism and this is something that's                                 similar to free software right you kind                                 of have the whole you know it can be                                 free as in beer or not as in speech in                                 other cases they still have a patchy                                 licensing where they allow you to take                                 and redistribute package and modify code                                 as you see fit what you don't                                 necessarily get with these is that                                 governance and so in some cases                                 organizations are able to push changes                                 faster they're able to make bolder                                 decisions in terms of the direction that                                 they want to go but                                 you don't really have that confidence or                                 that peace of mind within the project if                                 you're adopting this for a broader                                 purpose and so companies like elastic                                 who have built a great business in and                                 around open source technology mongodb                                 tend to use open source is more of a                                 delivery mechanism again similar to sort                                 of a freemium model not quite the same                                 broader benefits that we see in some of                                 the more kind of community driven                                 development so why I even build a                                 community around a technology why does                                 it matter especially when you're trying                                 to build a business and trying to take                                 something to market well you know again                                 without having that body you have no                                 governance and there can be advantages                                 and as you're an organization who's                                 trying to drive something especially in                                 the early days in the one dot                                           two dot                                                              important it's it's helpful right                                 because you're not necessarily having to                                 do the whole bike shedding around every                                 change you don't have to kind of come in                                 and debate but without that what you                                 don't get is this sort of diverse set of                                 inputs you don't ensure that a broader                                 set of environments a broader set of                                 culturals like when it come to things                                 like languages are effectively getting                                 to utilize this technology and so as you                                 build this community it can kind of keep                                 you sort of true to the ultimate goal                                 which is building great software and I                                 think it you know something we pride                                 ourselves in lucid works every day we                                 want to go build a great business but                                 more importantly as you talk to                                 engineers or some folks who are here                                 today even and you'll see them giving a                                 variety of talks they really believe in                                 what they're doing and they believe in                                 the adoption that they've seen of this                                 technology and the evolution that's                                 something that you can take a lot of                                 pride on pride in and whether you're                                 working for the company or you're                                 outside of the company you're sort of a                                 part of a bigger movement if you will                                 around this technology and like I said                                 nothing makes us prouder than the fact                                 that you know hundreds of millions of                                 people every day billions of                                 transactions go through our system and                                 this is coming from contributions that                                 we make as an organization but more                                 importantly the contributions that come                                 in from the broader community you get a                                 lot of folks who dedicate a lot of time                                 and effort which is really special and                                 so people who want to see things move                                 forward they want to see changes they                                 have ideas that they want to share and                                 collaborate on and so they get to be a                                 part of this broader movement and as a                                 company it's a very fortunate thing when                                 come to events like this and we can meet                                 people from all over the world who have                                 interest in our technology not just in                                 utilizing it but in actually advancing                                 it forward and that body of that body of                                 knowledge of that body of experience                                 that we get to bring in is really                                 special and it really has an impact on                                 our technology so with all of that                                 greatness in open source and in the                                 communities in places like the Apache                                 foundation why build a company right why                                 can't we just let these things sort of                                 go and as I talked about earlier there's                                 a lot of velocity that can come from a                                 company and you see the more successful                                 projects they've always have an entity                                 or a sponsor behind them somebody who's                                 employing people to contribute on a                                 daily basis because in most cases people                                 who are contributing with in open source                                 who are not working for a sponsor                                 company you know they're either doing                                 this in their spare time or they're                                 doing this sort of in a lot of time that                                 they're given by their by their employer                                 when they've got a day job right what                                 also ends up happening is that companies                                 start to put these things into more                                 mission-critical types of deployments                                 right so the first thing that always                                 sort of comes to mind is support you                                 know in a commercial software                                 organization we kind of have this saying                                 it's all about the throat to choke right                                 if somebody is going to make a big bet                                 on technology especially an                                 infrastructure technology where it's not                                 just something that you're delivering to                                 an end user but you're building your                                 business you're building a variety of                                 products and services on top of this you                                 want to ensure that when something goes                                 wrong you have somebody to call right                                 you want to ensure that the people that                                 you have to call can actually get you up                                 and running quickly can respond can meet                                 service level expectations just like you                                 would within commercial software so                                 support is something that kind of comes                                 naturally to a company and at lucidworks                                 this was sort of the evolution of the                                 business that came from the founders and                                 committers of the project that said hey                                 you know we're helping a lot of people                                 out here through the forums through                                 things like stack exchange what if we                                 build a business here where we can start                                 to deliver SLA s and that to                                 organizations that want to go farther                                 with solar consulting is another big                                 thing obviously there's no better way to                                 get help whether its direction                                 architectural guidance or even how to                                 drive modifications within the code when                                 you can work with the core group of                                 people themselves and so this is a very                                 natural posture that a lot of open                                 source companies take and it's one that                                 can actually have some draw                                 backs and we'll talk a little bit about                                 that later the things that we really                                 realize our it goes beyond the core                                 project right when you get into the                                 enterprise in particular take something                                 like a vertical like retail life science                                 for research insurance where they're                                 doing compliance in monitoring where                                 they need more and it's not that they                                 can't develop more on their own but                                 there's really no point in them trying                                 to invest in the resources and the                                 development and the ongoing maintenance                                 to integrate with things like                                 proprietary technology security                                 frameworks like Active Directory for                                 instance more advanced features and                                 capabilities that go beyond the core of                                 that open source project and that's                                 where we see a great opportunity and                                 building a company around open source                                 where you can start to look into the                                 broader ecosystem and say there are                                 areas where we can start to make things                                 easier for folks because at the end of                                 the day one of my favorite sayings when                                 I talk to customers is free ain't free                                 right as developers and folks who have                                 worked with in open source technologies                                 just because you're not paying for a                                 license for something doesn't mean that                                 it just comes to you and suddenly you're                                 just ultimate instantly successful with                                 it right you often need to invest                                 resources you need to hire the right                                 people you need to ensure that you                                 actually have access to those people and                                 so sometimes talent can become a                                 bottleneck when it comes to adoption and                                 this is another opportunity as you have                                 a project that you're involved in                                 whether there's a sponsor or not to say                                 hey we can go stand up an organization                                 that can provide this final mile for                                 these folks so when you look at the                                 different models you know what what ends                                 up happening and it really depends on                                 the type of organization you build so in                                 you know I'm from San Francisco sort of                                 the what we call the silly valley if you                                 will especially now because we have so                                 many dating and food apps and things                                 that are just kind of ridiculous but as                                 the pressure comes in when you start                                 raising venture capital money it's not                                 just to say hey we're generating revenue                                 on a regular basis it's growing that                                 revenue right and the difficulty comes                                 when you get into a business where                                 you're simply coming in and offering                                 consulting services where organizations                                 will come to you and say hey I need your                                 help with a B or C and you go in and you                                 solve their problem and then they're on                                 their way and you never hear from them                                 again that's a very difficult way to                                 sort of build a reoccurring revenue base                                 and that's something that's incredibly                                 important for the lifespan of the                                 company and you see a lot of                                 organizations especially open source                                 companies that run into this challenge                                 where they get a lot of popularity                                 within the project especially early on a                                 lot of adoption people are coming to                                 them for consulting and that type of                                 help and then they determine you know                                 what I think we're good projects has                                 been stabilized we've been up and                                 running we've been able to go out and                                 hire people and so as a business it's                                 really hard to continuously sort of grow                                 that revenue stream and so you want to                                 find ways where you can actually create                                 ongoing value for your customer where                                 you can help them do things better                                 faster stronger where they're relying on                                 that open source core but you're driving                                 additional value support is another                                 thing where it goes a little bit beyond                                 consulting because you can have                                 relationships when you're offering                                 support that are ongoing but again over                                 time organizations start to build up                                 that expertise support is a lot like                                 insurance right it's saying you know                                 what I kind of know what I'm doing here                                 but in the event that something goes                                 incredibly wrong I want to have somebody                                 who I can call who I know is going to be                                 on the hook to make me successful and                                 you can imagine in your own daily life                                 if something like car insurance was a an                                 option for you right you could have it                                 but you weren't forced to have it you                                 could say you know what when times are                                 good and yep I like having that peace of                                 mind but you know as the economic                                 headwinds start to hit I think I'm going                                 to take a little more risk and so our                                 organizations tend to sort of think that                                 same way and so this is where kind of                                 moving that model from being a                                 consulting services organization even                                 being a pure support organization aunts                                 open source into that integration into                                 sort of building that higher level value                                 becomes incredibly important so in these                                 different models that companies tend to                                 take on you know you see companies like                                 data bricks today who are sort of                                 starting out with services and training                                 and again this is a great opportunity to                                 kind of get engaged with your install                                 base to start provide value to create                                 awareness of what you can do and where                                 you can come in and help them get                                 enterprises deployed quickly you can                                 harden their deployments give them                                 advice on things like architecture and                                 so forth but over time there's very                                 little commitment from that customer                                 back into the organization so again it's                                 difficult to sort of build a continuous                                 revenue stream and to continue to build                                 your organism                                 another challenge is you want to grow                                 right so who can you afford to hire when                                 you can't predict what type of revenue                                 is going to be coming into the business                                 right we all want to hire more engineers                                 we want to hire more field consultants                                 people who can go out there at luce                                 works you know we see it being such a                                 scarce resource of people who have deep                                 knowledge of our technology that we want                                 to go out and find as many folks as                                 possible to come be a part of our                                 organization but in order for me to do                                 that as a CEO of the company I have to                                 be able to project what our growth is                                 going to be how much cash are we going                                 to put into the business year over year                                 and so simply relying on a training                                 model doesn't really get you there and                                 you need to find something that's a                                 little more consistent as your sort of                                 building that revenue stream talked                                 about this a bit a bit already but that                                 Enterprise Support model you know this                                 is one of the more natural evolutions                                 that an open source company goes towards                                 where you can start to provide those SLA                                 s and these types of things but the                                 drawback is where you get into this idea                                 of sort of optional insurance and over                                 time as companies build up their                                 expertise we see a diminished value and                                 what history has kind of told us is that                                 people who sort of start to build out an                                 organization around this model when the                                 project is in its infancy stages where                                 it has a lot of issues where there's a                                 lot of stability where they need                                 constant touches with the organization                                 it tends to be an exciting time because                                 you can go out and you can start to                                 acquire a lot of customers especially in                                 a popular project but as organizations                                 become more dependent on you I'm sorry                                 more dependent on your technology what                                 they're going to do is they're going to                                 invest in their own resources they're                                 going to start to hire they're going to                                 start to bring people on board who can                                 start to you know handle these things                                 internally we go into organizations                                 today some of the financial services                                 where their solar team is                                              of ours and their organizations or you                                 know tens of billions of dollars right                                 so when we come in and say hey yeah                                 we're going to be the folks that you                                 guys can call when something goes down                                 that doesn't typically Phi so well so                                 you want to find a way to kind of                                 evolved beyond this datastax did                                 something interesting and I it kind of                                 has its pros and it's cons but you moved                                 into what sort of a certified                                 distribution model and so what this said                                 is that we are going to give you a                                 version of Cassandra that's been                                 hardened that's been tested that goes                                 through more                                 testing and trials then what you get                                 from the Apache version and they've                                 pegged their open source support to that                                 version and so there you're at least                                 creating some dependency within your                                 customer base where if they want to have                                 this level of service in this level of                                 assurances they're working along your                                 certified distribution what happens here                                 in what typically is the drawback is                                 that you start to deviate from what that                                 sort of primary branch or Corbett of                                 code is and so a lot of the advantages                                 that people see in open source is again                                 diversity of input the changes that they                                 could take advantage of the transparency                                 starts to diminish so where it sort of                                 creates a tighter relationship with the                                 end user it can tend to sort of dilute                                 the value of what open source technology                                 really brings into an organization so                                 it's something that you want to think                                 carefully about it's something that you                                 want to spend a lot of time with your                                 community and with your customer base                                 and understand where the areas that                                 people are challenged that we can come                                 in and help and where are the things                                 that we want to stay away from so we                                 don't look like we've just simply forked                                 that you know fork the code and we're                                 maintaining something else over here and                                 you're not really getting the value of                                 open sores and then finally this is                                 where at lucidworks we sort of have                                 gotten to recently is extending with                                 proprietary features and add-ons and as                                 you do this what you want to be                                 cognizant of is sort of what are the use                                 cases that we can really go build a                                 business around because when you're                                 dealing in something like like searcher                                 or a data platform you know as                                 technologists and engineers we tend to                                 say hey this thing can do everything we                                 can replace your Oracle database we can                                 run your shopping website we can run                                 your content site you name it but as                                 we're building a business around this we                                 want to focus in on what are those                                 primary use cases that we think that we                                 can go out and monetize where we can add                                 a lot of value where we can build things                                 that help customers be a better version                                 of themselves right so in search an                                 example would be something like retail                                 where we've extended solar to bring in                                 all of the data acquisition that can go                                 out and pull things from databases and                                 provide data enrichment services at                                 ingestion time and then the relevancy                                 tuning and the recommendations and                                 machine learning that can help drive                                 better conversion on websites and as we                                 do this what happens is we sort of we                                 avoid creating conflict within the                                 community because we're looking at very                                 specific features in                                 capabilities that can extend solar in a                                 way that may not be for everybody                                 because what you don't want to do as the                                 commercial sponsors you don't want to                                 piss off your community to be frank                                 excuse my language but it's it's really                                 about what are the things that we can                                 contribute and in a source we have a                                 dedicated team within the open source                                 who their job is to continuously bring                                 code back in and we try to look at the                                 broadest set of features that we can                                 contribute back into solar and the                                 things that we commercialize the things                                 that we make proprietary on top of it                                 are very specific we tend to look at                                 this sort of sponsor versus guardian we                                 are not the guardian of the community                                 the commuting is the community is the                                 guardian of itself our job is to be a                                 cheerleader our job is to support to                                 provide resources where we can wear it                                 actually makes sense to help sort of                                 encourage and grow the open source                                 community and build our business or                                 along specific verticals where we can                                 create additional value for customers                                 that are really looking for solutions so                                 when you think about the community one                                 of the things that the community really                                 cares about well they don't want to see                                 you hold this back and I think some                                 companies actually do a pretty poor job                                 at making this separation things like                                 security security is important                                 especially in a data platform there's no                                 reason for the organization to go and                                 develop proprietary features around                                 security when it's something that can be                                 absorbed by the broader community and so                                 it's important to bring those types of                                 features back ease of use scalability                                 stability you know when you get into                                 that certified model you want to stay                                 away from this notion of well this is                                 the more stable version of the open                                 source code if you have that capability                                 to go out and develop at you should be                                 bringing that back into the community                                 the things the community doesn't care                                 about necessarily again these industry                                 specific use cases integrations with                                 proprietary technologies right our                                 SharePoint connector not the most                                 exciting thing but this isn't something                                 that you know the solar community is                                 incredibly excited for us to go and                                 contribute back so we can take that out                                 we can commercialize that for                                 organizations that are using SharePoint                                 typically organizations used to working                                 with proprietary software who are okay                                 purchasing license you can also look at                                 this in terms of other sort of pain                                 points for the community where they may                                 not want your additional extensions                                 right where we're increasing the                                 technical debt within the project so                                 things like testing overhead and that                                 becomes more complicate                                 in longer tail where you're increasing                                 the size of the package that oh hey we                                 developed all of these things for some                                 very specific use cases and now the                                 package size is doubled it's not really                                 something that the community gets too                                 thrilled about so what you want to look                                 at is again can I develop things that                                 that that aren't useful to a broader set                                 of the population but for really a                                 subset of that population I'm going to                                 kind of hurry up here just because we're                                 running out a little bit of time but I                                 wanted to make this a bit of a case                                 study so at lucidworks we had been in                                 business for about five years we were                                 working along apache solr like i said                                 providing support surrounding consulting                                 services and one of the things that we                                 noticed in our install base was that                                 more and more people were building                                 expertise operationally didn't                                 necessarily need support to keep the                                 thing up and running in fact solar was                                 quite stable but they were building                                 these applications with varying degrees                                 of success that we felt like we could                                 come in and help them do better so the                                 first thing is we took a look at                                 different industries we looked at                                 patterns within our support cases we                                 looked at patterns within the services                                 business that we were building and we                                 look for areas where we thought you know                                 what people would be more than happy to                                 make a by verse bill decision if we                                 could extend solar in these particular                                 ways so when you're looking into the                                 verticals that you want to extend into                                 make sure that there's use cases that                                 exist that you can go out and monetize                                 you want to find industries that are                                 open to open source adoption now this is                                 something that's actually evolved over                                 the years you know back in the day ten                                 years ago you very rarely see government                                 or financial service or health care                                 actually utilize open source technology                                 now it's considered imperative for                                 organizations that want to stay agile                                 that want to stay competitive that they                                 have to look to what's going out there                                 in the community and not become locked                                 in by vendors so that problem is no                                 longer really as much of a concern and                                 then like I said you have organizations                                 that are active within communities and                                 these are areas that you can target and                                 then from there you want to go to the                                 use cases you want to say what are the                                 most high value areas and you want to                                 pick just a handful right you can't just                                 go out and say you're going to go out                                 and boil the ocean and do things for                                 everybody because it can tell you it's                                 just from experience it's very hard to                                 go out and build a business that way but                                 when you can find a very narrow set of                                 cases where you say we can build                                 proprietary features here that                                 specifically increase the capability for                                 these verda                                 for these industries for these use cases                                 you can start to build a successful                                 commercial business on top of your open                                 source so with loosen'd works we like i                                 said we looked back over all of our                                 consulting engagements training                                 engagements the support cases that we                                 had and we determined what our top six                                 use cases were in which people wanted to                                 do more with search and they were                                 usually limited by time and resources or                                 simply just acquiring enough talent to                                 go out and build things like                                 recommendation engines like data                                 acquisition frameworks and so we                                 developed a platform that we call fusion                                 which takes solar and then we've                                 introduced spark recently and talk more                                 about that if you want to come by our                                 booth and then built the proprietary                                 features around that that could drive                                 our core use cases so things like our                                 data acquisition framework our machine                                 learning and signal processing                                 facilities which allow us to do advanced                                 analytics to determine better user                                 experiences and relevancy better you is                                 for doing tuning and again these are                                 things that add value in particular                                 cases but not necessarily things where                                 the community goes hey why don't you                                 contribute that back in we try to be                                 very careful about the things that we                                 want to bring back into solar that we                                 know have that broader case this also                                 allows us to take advantage of a model                                 that we call open core which means at                                 its at its core you're dealing with                                 unadulterated solar so all of the api's                                 are available you can deploy the fusion                                 bits against existing applications and                                 so it prevents some of that vendor                                 lock-in as well so what you get is you                                 get that advantage of open source                                 technology but we can build a licensed                                 business that's much easier to scale                                 from a revenue perspective and so you                                 reduce the friction of adoption of                                 places that are saying you know what we                                 don't want to get burned especially in                                 search there's been so much                                 consolidation right and Dekka got bought                                 by oracle fast gets bought by might but                                 by microsoft autonomy turned into a                                 freaking disaster so people are very                                 kind of apprehensive about this adoption                                 and so as we can deliver this open core                                 model it makes it gives people a peace                                 of mind finally you know again I can't                                 stress enough and I think most people                                 understand this but you know we like to                                 sometimes romanticize about open source                                 and just the community driven                                 development good projects need good                                 companies they need companies who are                                 acting as a sponsorship who are not                                 trying to just be the Guardian and                                 controller of something but really the                                 cheerleader the supporter bringing in                                 things that the community can't                                 necessarily do themselves you know we                                 promote every solar release through                                 webinars we go out to thousands of                                 people who come in can learn about this                                 we have our folks lead those efforts                                 providing cooler t-shirts and stickers                                 and websites and all the things that we                                 can do to really prop up the community                                 effort and prop up the project without                                 getting in the way or sort of seeing as                                 a burden or a drag to it we try to                                 champion the committers wherever we can                                 again we're always out there trying to                                 hire different folks from within the                                 community there's a whole other talk we                                 could give about the balance of not                                 wanting to hire everybody within your                                 community because then you don't really                                 have the diversity and those types of                                 things that are important but we want to                                 ensure that wherever we can is we have                                 get-togethers as we sponsor conferences                                 that we're bringing these folks together                                 that we're showing them appreciation                                 that we're trying to provide the support                                 that an organization can provide that                                 can't necessarily happen organically out                                 there and then finally you know what are                                 some of the lessons that we learned                                 support is a hard business it's a great                                 way to get started it's a great way to                                 bootstrap but it's a very hard business                                 to scale and as people are coming to you                                 and they're coming for these low-end                                 packages in particular where they're                                 saying hey you know I want to pay you                                 fifteen twenty thousand dollars a year                                 what ends up happening more often than                                 not is that they have a specific set of                                 problems that they want you to come in                                 and help resolve and then they sort of                                 go away and again if you're going to                                 build a healthy organization if you go                                 out and hire great engineers and great                                 people you need to have the ability to                                 predict your business to grow your                                 business and so our lesson was that you                                 know what we're really need to kind of                                 stay away from just a pure-play low end                                 support business we find other ways to                                 help them through community forums and                                 those types of things but they're really                                 not the kind of customer base that we                                 have again going beyond just sort of                                 that brake fixed support if something is                                 important to your customer they will                                 build expertise around it there's no                                 doubt about that whether it takes them a                                 year or five years they will get there                                 eventually and so you want to kind of                                 increase the value of what you bring as                                 an organization our people I've always                                 been our most valuable asset will                                 continue to be our most valuable asset                                 one of the things that you know we pride                                 ourselves on again is that the folks who                                 are here at lucidworks what they're                                 doing with this technology whether they                                 were working for us or not these are the                                 things that they care about and care is                                 an incredibly important part of our                                 business and we looked                                 people who have just care about the                                 technology I care about the customers                                 who care about the problems that we're                                 solving and we try to value that as much                                 as possible this is not you know the                                     where you would go out and build these                                 software companies up in the boardroom                                 and all the business folks were there                                 cheering in cigars and whatever you know                                 this is the world of developer led                                 business and as we go in as we start to                                 work with our customers we're not                                 talking to executives we're talking to                                 executive developers we're trying to                                 solve their problems we're trying to                                 bring value into what they're doing day                                 to day and that's something that we                                 pride ourselves on and the final thing                                 and as lucid works again eight years in                                 the business what we learn is the open                                 to evolution right what works today may                                 not work tomorrow I think one of the                                 worst things you can do is you're trying                                 to grow an organization or grow a                                 business it's sort of commit to                                 something full-heartedly where you say                                 you know what this is what we said this                                 is what we're going to continue to do                                 and we're not going to waver right you                                 want to be open to that evolution you                                 want to listen to your customers you                                 want to watch the business you want to                                 see what's working and what's not and                                 really optimized for that so I think I'm                                 a few minutes over so everybody can get                                 to lunch happy to answer any questions                                 here or afterwards but thank you all                                 very much I really appreciate it it's a                                 great buzz word thank you will yes we                                 have time for questions we have exactly                                 seven minutes for questions so slow down                                 yeah so who has a question in the                                 audience I'm so quick question what is                                 your revenue mix look like today like                                 how much is platform how much is still                                  support that's a good question so you                                  know we we sort of made this shift about                                  three years ago and in fact even to blow                                  it out even further initially what the                                  business was looking like was about                                  seventy percent consulting services and                                  thirty percent enterprise support and                                  about                                                                   the organization to say we've got to get                                  away from you know what we call one-time                                  revenue because again it's very hard to                                  predict it's very hard to grow the                                  business and frankly as you're out                                  raising money and doing all the kind of                                  under the less glamorous things that you                                  need to do in terms of running an                                  organization it's just it's difficult to                                  gain that traction when we launched                                  fusion which was in                                                     had shifted the business to about                                  t % subscription which was a very good                                  shift for us within one year fusion                                  launched in                                                           within that subscription revenue which                                  was then about eighty percent of the                                  revenue mix we were doing about                                         that through the commercial platform so                                  this was a goal that we set out to do                                  and we were actually quite successful                                  with and we were very proud of the                                  outlier there and the one thing I didn't                                  talk about too much in the support                                  business is that you will get two cases                                  where support can be interesting for you                                  and we tend to look at some of the most                                  complex and some of the largest                                  deployment so salesforce com is replat                                  formed everything search on top of solar                                  and in those types of infrastructure                                  decisions you're not going to go with                                  something proprietary and we understand                                  that but we're more than happy in fact                                  we're quite excited to work with them                                  and to support them the apple icloud                                  would be another example of that and                                  what we look at is if you think about                                  the architecture and the open core model                                  you know our investment in solar which                                  is great because it's something we                                  believe in it's also core to what we're                                  trying to build on top so as we can get                                  into environments like salesforce and                                  start working at those volumes and those                                  sizes of distributions and the                                  complexity that they bring to it it's                                  actually great experience for us we                                  bring that obviously back into the open                                  source code base and we consume all that                                  value up the stack so sometimes that                                  that mix though the transaction mix is                                  much heavier on the platform side we've                                  done some significant deals in the open                                  source for support for these very large                                  complicated organizations another                                  question thanks are you mentioned                                  industry specific features like a                                  SharePoint connector which you develop                                  for customers do you got a path for your                                  industry or commercial products how you                                  will push them into the community in the                                  future if you see you brought need for                                  that again if we see a broad need we're                                  more than happy to do it we have a                                  saying SolarWinds we win right but what                                  we found is you get to these more                                  specific especially proprietary                                  integrations the community really is not                                  interested in that and so I think we've                                  done a really good job in sort of                                  drawing that line between what do we do                                  for the community as a whole and what do                                  we do for the business                                  and to date we haven't seen a lot of                                  pressure either way what will get                                  interesting is we do a lot of sort of                                  machine learning and analytics and                                  things that we're bringing back in to                                  provide better search experiences I                                  think the industry is sort of evolving                                  towards that utilizing not just searches                                  and index and a retrieval engine but                                  really the smarts that come with the                                  search engine and so I think we'll have                                  a moment we'll have to kind of look at                                  okay is some of what we're doing around                                  you know the machine learning aspect and                                  the prediction aspect of retrieval                                  something that can make sense back                                  within the community but then you get                                  into again the technical debt and the                                  footprint and that that you bring back                                  into the project so it's quite possible                                  that we open source a component that                                  works with solar that's not necessarily                                  part of the solar distribution good                                  question we hear ya you mentioned the                                  challenges of interacting with the                                  community and gave revised how to avoid                                  pissing them off so my question was do                                  you think that the same advice would                                  apply to a company that builds on open                                  source software that is used by normal                                  people as opposed to company's officers                                  so I guess I mean in any case when you                                  have a community community is a funny                                  beast right because there's a lot of                                  personalities there's a lot of emotions                                  I remember when I first came to lucid                                  works again I had not been in and around                                  open source technology I was like wow                                  like people take some of this stuff                                  really personally it would like some                                  really kind of nasty things that were                                  going on on the list and that kind of                                  thing I think it's always you know do                                  your best to be a good citizen right do                                  your best to be respectful and as an                                  organization and I guess I think                                  Bloomberg is a good example right there                                  they are like so far ahead in terms of a                                  lot of the rd and the things that                                  they're doing but they showcase that                                  back publicly and they're very open                                  about their use and they've been                                  contributing things back in and I think                                  their companies that can do this really                                  well the stigma i think is targeted more                                  at the company who claims to be the                                  steward of the project because now                                  you're sort of exposed as whether you're                                  doing right or wrong right companies who                                  have other sort of focuses that are                                  interacting with the community it's                                  typically always seen as like oh that's                                  really generous of them to                                  come in and spend their time sponsor a                                  conference contribute code or blogs and                                  those kinds of things back but as you                                  sort of stand up and say hey I'm going                                  to be the commercial entity behind this                                  thing you're you're just you have a lot                                  more exposure and a lot more                                  expectations and I think listening is                                  the first thing that you have to do and                                  I try to keep you know in touch with                                  folks even outside of the company in                                  terms of okay you know how are we doing                                  what are the perceptions that are going                                  on what do you think of the work we're                                  doing infusion and those kinds of things                                  and then our own team like I said it's                                  very special in that our open source                                  team some of them were actually here                                  today are you know they're almost                                  representatives of the community first                                  employees of lucid work second and                                  they're very vocal and they don't                                  hesitate to tell us when hey you know                                  what I don't think we should do it that                                  way or you know things like logo changes                                  or website updates and things that we                                  just wanted to do to create better                                  experiences for the end users we want to                                  make sure that we were doing this                                  without creating too much friction but I                                  think like all things sort of social                                  that you know you just kind of want to                                  have a level of awareness and you want                                  to listen to the people around you and                                  it doesn't mean that you know they're                                  necessarily always right or you're                                  necessarily always right but there's                                  just an element of respect that that                                  needs to come into this and you know I                                  hope that the impression is as an                                  organization that we've done a good job                                  at that it doesn't mean that we don't                                  occasionally step on toes or create some                                  friction that we have to then go out and                                  kind of smooth the waters course oh well                                  thank you will I'm giving a big round of                                  applause another one more time
