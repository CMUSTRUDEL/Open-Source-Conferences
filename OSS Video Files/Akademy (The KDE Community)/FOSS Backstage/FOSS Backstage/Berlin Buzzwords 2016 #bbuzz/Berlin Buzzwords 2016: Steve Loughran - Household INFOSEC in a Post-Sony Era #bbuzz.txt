Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2016: Steve Loughran - Household INFOSEC in a Post-Sony Era #bbuzz

Description: 
	The attack on Sony led to lots of talk about how they could have defended themselves. Is your household any better? Have you defence in depth? Is all that protects you a ISP's base station hasn't had an upgrade for four years? How often do you upgrade Adobe Flash on your TV? And what is it you really need to worry about in a world of internet-enabled-everything? 

I examine the threat model and attack vectors, going beyond "keep your PC up to date" to the new problems: smart TVs, fitness trackers, smartphone apps â€”even the INFOSEC issues of modern cars. In the process: whether you are publishing so much private data that worrying about laptop security is moot. Finally, it considers whether your github credentials are strategic data to nation states. After this talk you'll not only want an OSS router, you'll be packet sniffing your TV, encrypting your sensitive data off-site, and, the next time you buy a car, asking to download its ABS and near-miss event history.

	                              Steve hi everyone i am steve cochran and                               quick and don't come up Mount myself I I                               work at home I work on Hadoop full-time                               hands up who uses her dupe all the                               libraries okay you're running my code                               and your own you'll notice if you see                               stack traces the key point is I code                               from home now title is talk household                               infosec in a post Sony era what does                                that mean well a couple years ago Sony                                got completely owned I had all their                                data out there they're embarrassing                                emails their spreadsheets on star                                salaries everything got ripped apart and                                all the security people saying oh oh                                sony got it wrong so he didn't have                                their defense in depth their log truck                                he know that all their security stuff                                what were they doing wrong and I felt I                                felt that was a bit cruel because I                                thinking could I secure my own health                                would I know what would happen how can I                                say criticize them without being in a                                state myself to defend the things so I                                thought right well I will do it I will                                try and make my house secure as a                                summary the talk I failed dramatically                                for reasons we'll get into okay but I'll                                be surprised if you could do any better                                and if you are can I'd like some answers                                I think key point is is like what am I                                trying to do so I'm trying to make my                                house secure or more importantly I want                                the data in it to be secure I want it to                                be uncorrupted I want to be able to get                                that data one I when I want it don't                                want it to be you know encrypted and                                having to paying bitcoins for it back so                                it available and I wanted to be mine as                                in private I don't want it to be up on                                the web unless I specifically put it                                there the final thing resource control                                means I want my son to go to bed and not                                watch YouTube when he's in bed okay so                                that's a special case so the first                                lesson from the Sony hack is do not make                                an enemy of a government or anyone with                                similar skills anonymous other full-time                                hacker groups none of us stand a chance                                in that world if somebody's going to sit                                down and break into you knowing who you                                are what you run                                and stuff you're doomed so get over it                                by not making enemies like that scope                                things back and say right I'm going to                                defend against drive-bys malware that                                just basically does a boot force attack                                scans my network tries to go through the                                browser's things like that with                                laura-leigh targeting me they're                                targeting everyone in mass market                                attacks so that's my goal can I defend                                against that but you got to think about                                privacy to the key point is when I                                started looking at security I should                                think about not just how to stop people                                malicious getting in but stop my                                personal data getting out I think the                                big difference between security then in                                privacy is security is how vulnerable is                                my systems are having somebody break in                                whereas privacy is more how much of my                                personal information does this                                well-designed app leak outside my house                                even when it's behaving as intended you                                know privacy violations that are built                                into modern systems I think would be my                                conclusion so I went around trying to                                split things up onto that different                                scale vulnerability versus privacy nice                                and simple beginning a notepad piece of                                paper and a pencil nobody can steal it                                lista get into your health doesn't                                really leak day to the outside world                                unless I stick photos up online there's                                not much of a backup strategy there's                                the house burns down the papers gone so                                that's a price but it's it's secure the                                other end of the scale windows XP the                                most insecure system you can buy right                                now well god buy it you wouldn't even                                bother to download it by the time you've                                installed it it will be have somebody                                will have found it on the network and be                                running things the sole reason it won't                                be running bit calm mining is it's so                                out of date that they probably don't get                                the decent device drivers for the GPUs                                so just hands up who's got windows XP in                                 their house I saw her that was buying                                 something two weeks ago in a shop and                                 they had a windows XP to shopping too                                 you know till for the money which is                                 terrifying it's embedded out there so                                 that's                                                              other one is the previously scale                                       google okay they want everything about                                 you they want to know everything about                                 you they're trying to model you                                 so that's that's the other axis so now                                 that foreground let's have a look at                                 what our systems we have how what do I                                 think they are in terms of security and                                 vulnerability so Firefox hands up                                 Firefox now I think actually it's pretty                                 secure as long as you keep it up-to-date                                 you also have to run your ad blockers                                 out there because that's the standard                                 attack for drive-bys is people will                                 place an ad saying i want people running                                 windows XP with firefox and flash                                 installed and they own you so keep it up                                 to date what's nice it's relatively                                 secure it's relatively private except                                 once you make Google your search engine                                 and then we have chrome I actually think                                 it's better for keeping itself up to                                 date but in exchange it's permanently                                 sharing all your personal data if you're                                 curious bring up wireshark and start                                 listening to how much packets being sent                                 once you're logged into chrome it's just                                 permanently chattering away I have no                                 idea what it's doing I tried to actually                                 uninstall this and make go myself user                                 list but then everything broke at that                                 point so I've logged in and accept                                 inevitable there and then there's                                 internet explorer don't run this that's                                 all the summaries just don't run it okay                                 download firefox or chrome and then just                                 leave it alone flash don't run that                                 either if you can help it really it's a                                 it's insecurity jitters between a                                      the                                                                     beginning a month with a nine there'll                                 be an emergency patch two weeks later it                                 goes to                                                                best thing you do is uninstall it you                                 can maybe go with chrome it does keep it                                 up-to-date maybe in the background it                                 also leaked privacy in different ways                                 because as its own cookies so you think                                 you've deleted your cookies you haven't                                 best metric that you have flash isn't                                 working as you go to BBC website and you                                 can't watch videos about Donald Trump I                                 think that's a success that you know we                                 should all be grateful for that's                                 destroying stopping your mind being                                 damaged at the same time so now we have                                 a nice scale basically we have privacy                                 at the top vulnerability down below                                 nodes where I've put everything at the                                 end of the vulnerability scale and it's                                 also interesting that things get more                                 and more vulnerable over time if you                                 leave something alone it just inherited                                 becomes more insecure                                 but that's just a PC that's not what my                                 house is like I go into the room next to                                 my office and there is sometimes too                                 often a child in front of the television                                 he's playing a video game online video                                 game on a ps                                                            TV through an amplifier that has an                                 Ethernet port in the back for airplay he                                 has an ipad we're watching a YouTube                                 video and there was a phone where he's                                 actually talking to his friends on                                 snapchat that is my son and most these                                 things they are consumer goods the one                                 I'm going to call out is the television                                 by LG where someone found a couple years                                 ago that it was sending unencrypted                                 packets to LG servers in Korea South                                 Korea that is letting them know what                                 terrestrial TV channels you were tuned                                 into that's a television that's                                 basically something what you're watching                                 and there's a bit of embarrassing but                                 about that an LG basically changed your                                 privacy policy to say yes we can and                                 children shouldn't be watching this TV                                 because it's personal information I                                 brought up wireshark I couldn't see it                                 but in the hand it's it chatters away                                 and choosing encrypted channels now so                                 it might be you know enough that's the                                 dividing line between a smart television                                 and the dumb monitor okay dumb monitors                                 don't steal your personal secrets and                                 there's nothing in there to get owned                                 and of course all this is defended from                                 the outside world by a netgear firewall                                 off but whilst people and all he's got a                                 ps                                                                    between them in the outside world okay                                 well the scary thing about this is a few                                 years old liver time I checked for a                                 firmware update it says there isn't none                                 and you think how many more security                                 patches and violation have come up over                                 time when this one goes no nothing                                 insecure I got fed up with this and went                                 and downloaded the dd-wrt open-source                                 firewall stuff instead it's incredibly                                 good it's incredibly powerful it's got                                 lots of features I couldn't get it to                                 work or more strictly I couldn't get the                                 PPP o OE stuff to work with my isp                                 British Telecom so I sort of half gave                                 up on that stuck it in the middle of                                 things probably insecure relative                                 private said right                                 I'm going to give up on that instead I'm                                 going to solve the problem slightly                                 differently so what is went out and                                 bought a new netgear firewall and I'm                                 just going to assume that consumer                                 devices like this they're going to have                                 a finite lifespan of about two or three                                 years before I start trying to open                                 source them I took that all Rita flashed                                 it to DB dd-wrt and actually created a                                 separate subnet inside my house so                                 lately partitioned the stuff I really                                 care about my laptop my development                                 tools the code you're running and that's                                 isolated from the stuff that my son is                                 trying to run consumer electronics the                                 televisions the PS Falls there's a                                 Raspberry Pi on there there's another                                 smart TV dealers we're building this                                 collection of internet-enabled devices                                 in our house we have no idea what the                                 source code is they don't get kept up to                                 date and how you know how can you trust                                 your doorbell or your light switch to be                                 secure anymore so if isolated them out                                 that doesn't mean I mean I've got no                                 control over the privacy but at least I                                 can kind of limit limit the damage they                                 can do and I think that's the best I can                                 hope for I would be like to declare                                 success at this point but like I said                                 I've been fighting a losing battle                                 because I have a smartphone smartphones                                 in the room hands up yeah you lose here                                 are two examples of phones is android                                 android goes to previous even worse on                                 the left british airways checking out                                 and that british airways check it out                                 good it wants to know my calendar my                                 private details my location and all my                                 photos that's the left screenshot next                                 to it says i'm flying to terminal null                                 in nairobi so someone out there doesn't                                 know their sequel validation about data                                 that comes back over the wire that's a                                 warning sign that means whoever wrote                                 that code isn't going to be writing a                                 secure app so many there's easyjet they                                 want to them identity location photos                                 camera device ID and call information                                 who I'm talking to and it's got a                                 nullpointerexception there it's the same                                 thing the developers are well-meaning                                 but they've asked for society much                                 permission and like the rest of us we                                 can't can't write write code that works                                 properly there's not a fault of them                                 with all the same but it's just the fact                                 is the phones given the information and                                 then even if the airplanes aren't                                 maliciously stealing my                                 calendar details it's insecure and we're                                 you know we're building that in and it                                 goes outside the firewall so we're just                                 we've lost control there so that's an                                    ok I'll phones or limb so I was really                                 didn't like the android I went and                                 bought an iphone instead and I was                                 really excited now i'm preparing for                                 this talk i was going to bring up the                                 slide saying hey look last year android                                 knew where I was going this year go to                                 Google location and they don't know                                 where I'm going except it turns out                                 google no knew that i drove from bristol                                 to a bit of Wales and they could even                                 work out how illegally fast i was                                 driving based on the timestamps along                                 there and the reasons that turned out to                                 be Google photos I thought maybe                                 actually the google mail checking with                                 doing it but in fact Google photos                                 heartbeats in letting Google central                                 know where you are for a better                                 photographic experience google photos                                 hands up turn the privet turn the                                 location data off in fact you know                                 you're gonna run anything Google make                                 sure it's not lugging you but basically                                 Google seem to be doing everything they                                 can to track you and model you and                                 everything like that so no I think we've                                 lost there as well and then of course                                 comes my little fitness tracker fitness                                 bits and some fitness trackers yeah okay                                 that's sending my heartbeats and                                 sleeping habits up to Microsoft                                 somewhere unless the same people the                                 Microsoft that wrote windows XP though I                                 think they've learned interesting enough                                 I think someone else Fitbit they had a                                 there was a virus that was going over                                 bluetooth between their devices also                                 they were unintentionally publishing                                 when people were having sex which when                                 you combine with a facebook graph you                                 can work out who they are up to up to                                 with i also have a little bicycle                                 speedometer thing that tracks my                                 location to both of those devices they                                 upload my gps data to services like                                 strata and that driver sorry at least                                 that I'm getting something exchange for                                 my information I can take my heart                                 beating data my sleeping habits then go                                 to my doctor and say look I'm having a                                 bad time sleeping on my heart rates too                                 high I can go to strive and say look I                                 me doing work so yes I'm leaking lots of                                 information there but I am getting                                 something back for it I also think                                 compared to something like a phone these                                 are relatively secure                                 I'm going to put them security probably                                 three privacy six plus and then things                                 just got worse we got a second-hand car                                 lost september-october which was three                                 years old at previous owner now I                                 actually tried to download the vehicle                                 history of this only they wouldn't                                 really let me at it the point being it's                                 all there the car knows when it's been                                 driven how along ABS has been engaged                                 whether it was in manual mode or                                 automatic of all the kind of things that                                 you shouldn't be doing with the car is                                 in that look so it would be nice for me                                 to know when we resell it I have to                                 think about a raising all that history                                 because my wife drives it badly but then                                 you get suspicious when you go buy a new                                 car you go let's look at this driving                                 history and it's like oh no it's empty                                 if you're like when you buy a car and                                 the engines will be cleaned up it means                                 although it was leaking oil and they've                                 hidden it so that's that yeah that's a                                 privacy violation being hard coded into                                 our vehicles and about it where i live                                 in bristol it's hilly so all i think i                                 need to do would be actually no vehicle                                 acceleration speed duration of your                                 distance between stops and you can work                                 out where I live where my son goes to                                 school where our journeys are so it's                                 not just a history of vehicle users a                                 history of how I've traveled around the                                 country at least one on driving combine                                 that with my phone and my little fitness                                 tracker and basically you know                                 everything about where I go to so that's                                 not very good on a privacy perspective                                 what do you think is like security size                                                                                                          pretty good until eventually sat down to                                 read the full infotainment manual and it                                 tells me how to turn flash off this is                                 not a joke this is from the manual it's                                 like settings sound cookies change to                                 mobile web page view call up options                                 activate flash player it's like I was                                 terrified at this point I mean you                                 basically you run around to the car to                                 make sure it's not really running flash                                 ah oh yeah that's a good point really                                 so that certificates isn't it that's                                 don't warn about illegal certificate and                                 of course this is the car that's hooked                                 up to my phone and then gets back to my                                 laptop so it's a couple of hops away                                 anyway I was very lucky we got them we                                 discovered that the previous owner of                                 this car had not paid the premium for                                 the flash option so you know we we                                 dodged a bullet there but when you buy a                                 second-hand car you don't say does it                                 have flash installed I don't know why                                 you're laughing hands up who's bought a                                 car for this within four years old or                                 less did it have flash installed exactly                                 exactly we don't know we have absolutely                                 lost control and people going about                                 diesel gate being a scandal I mean cars                                 designed to kill people anyway but you                                 know putting flashing is he morally                                 wrong anyway at that point I'm going to                                 have to conclude that we're out of                                 control so you put the privacy and                                 security yourself up there and the fact                                 that is windows XP there isn't actually                                 so bad anymore because if you've got a                                 phone up there and we've got a car with                                 / install and then you know I'm sending                                 my entire heart beat and sleeping habits                                 up to Microsoft huh and that's basically                                 it really we have we've lost okay and                                 you know I can't secure my house anymore                                 I in the last few months I've become                                 aware of how utterly insecure my house                                 is but sure can keep Firefox up to date                                 I can you know install the new flash                                 player but there's always apps on the                                 phone I need to check in to get home                                 tomorrow we put a car that you know                                 could have had flash installed and it's                                 just no we can't do a thing about it the                                 only way I could secure my house would                                 be getting a                                                           it at all getting all this little nokia                                 phones going back to pencil and paper                                 and telling my son he can't have friends                                 it's too late for consumers to stand a                                 chance to fix this okay you cannot do it                                 at the point of purchase we need to fix                                 this firstly whoever's in the BMW sauber                                 engineering team needs to tell their                                 marketing department that flash is a bad                                 idea the rest of us we need to look at                                 our code and start thinking this is                                 unacceptable we cannot build in the                                 security                                 violations that are going to be out                                 there we can't we have to think very                                 hard about what personal information                                 people give away and ensure that people                                 get something meaningful in exchange for                                 it sharing my GPS traces exchange for                                 cycling history and stuff I'm happy with                                 that having my television record what                                 channels my son watches not so good so                                 we need to do this we are the people who                                 are aware of what can be going on we are                                 the people who ruin our position to fix                                 this so if you take home something from                                 this talk consider this all external                                 data is malicious just don't trust a                                 single packet that comes over the wire                                 assume things like anything talk about                                 buffer length will be lying and you know                                 anything that looks a bit like a struck                                 that you're reading in is going to be                                 malicious for example the arrow talk                                 yesterday was talked about in memory                                 data structures assume that in-memory                                 data structure been passed as malicious                                 and it's offsets a point you can                                 somewhere random in your own system                                 memory I just do not trust any data that                                 comes in from outside similarly I think                                 we need to consider that all interaction                                 to the outside world are leaking some                                 form of personal information now I don't                                 know what we can do about that but at                                 least be vaguely aware of it as an                                 example here is me creating a URL of                                 what is North Korea's new social network                                 and then printing it is this secure or                                 insecure his in its in a talk what                                 actually happens is when you call URL to                                 string in Java it does a DNS lookup of                                 the string name you passed him so that's                                 me is just on a DNS lookup in career but                                 means North Korea now know that somebody                                 from the UK is interested in their                                 social network too they now have the                                 option of sending a DNS packet all the                                 way back to my house through that                                 netgear firewall through the untrusted                                 zone through my second firewall to my                                 laptop and as we've seen this year you                                 can't trust DNS either so you know                                 that's just we don't think that's                                 insecure but really it is so we need to                                 understand all these issues and ideally                                 we should be running systems that aren't                                 that hopelessly insecure I'm going                                 finishing early which brings me to looks                                 golden tux spark spark everyone hands up                                 who's yawning spark spark one point six                                 point zero and using that version now                                 you're nervous now aren't you this is                                    lines of code which is in Scala so it's                                 not really that intelligible but it's                                 name is object file and key thing is                                 that green thing a little bit from the                                 bottom says utils deserialize array what                                 this little function is doing is loading                                 in a file that consists of a series of                                 serialized java objects that's a data                                 file so then why your java objects fine                                 now one interesting aspect about java                                 serialization is it assumed it doesn't                                 assume external data is malicious it                                 just reads it in int respects abuses all                                 the registers and just leaves you in a                                 bad state and it turns out the biggest                                 vulnerability you can get on this is                                 actually very good is with groovy                                 because in groovy you can serialize                                 closures little lump two juvies groovy                                 script and when someone DC realises it                                 they then groovy will then read that                                 string in it'll pass that and it will                                 run that code as you so what I need to                                 do to run this code in somebody's spark                                 cluster is to say please read this file                                 here is some interesting data why don't                                 you read it I could put it up online s                                  and say interesting data set and spark                                 will quite happily go into it the good                                 news is you have to have groovy on your                                 classpath for this to happen the bad                                 news is it's actually in spark assembly                                                                                                     spark people wanted it but because spark                                 depends on hive and the hive maven                                 metadata says by the way here comes                                 groovy that was one of the things I did                                 on spark was once we discovered this was                                 trying to get rid of it it's not in                                 spite one point six point one or later                                 but it's an example actually of just a                                 really hilarious combination of bugs                                 there's javadi's serialization                                 the real mistake its try to be helpful                                 it trust the date when it shouldn't                                 combined with something on the classpath                                 that nobody realized was there and                                 hideously insecure that combination                                 we're not two controllers like we need                                 you know we need to be more aware what's                                 going on I also think that we need to                                 move beyond this model of saying my                                 process is trusted Java has a sandbox                                 notion but I think we need to be more in                                 terms of compartmentalizing inside                                 system to the whole and you could maybe                                 use containers to do that speaks a right                                 let's use docker let's run their                                 container and will reduce the damage                                 which is good except when you type                                 docker Paul you're downloading a binary                                 from somebody else that says trust me I                                 am well meaning and competent because                                 here is a list of commands up there                                 which I believe everyone in this room                                 will have probably typed once in the                                 last week hands up you've done any of                                 these commands you're not software                                 developer you've kept your hand down you                                 an architect by any chance sorry but the                                 point is actually that's amazing is that                                 the only person in my house that                                 downloads executables on a regular basis                                 apart from yeah popham son's ps                                        and I pretty much do it every morning I                                 come in and do a get to pull maven in                                 school or something like that I don't                                 out gate up day I install them random                                 things of NPM which because it doesn't                                 work reliably its probly most secure but                                 at the chain and it's let's just insane                                 we're trying to write a secure systems                                 of tomorrow I'm writing the software                                 that you're running and yet I'm naively                                 trusting everyone out there with a build                                 file to basically be well-meaning and                                 the third hop away version of groovy to                                 not pass closures why are you nodding so                                 much Nicholas and you know I think about                                 those things that I really care about it                                 actually turns out that probably                                 actually those Apache credentials to                                 actually commit code back into her dupe                                 are probably some of the most sensitive                                 things I have with my password I could                                 probably change the build of Hadoop to                                 download a to basically run some little                                 maven plugin that downloads a jar that I                                 stuck up on                                 maven central week before that                                 recognizes if the user name is Nick                                 birch that will then run random code                                 steal his credentials and in delete all                                 his personal data apartment really                                 embarrassing photo which goes up on                                 YouTube I don't know why you're laughing                                 you should be looking nervous now and                                 you know we so we software developers we                                 just chosen the wrong process we're you                                 know we're we're naively trusting we                                 have to recognize that we shouldn't do                                 that we have to be paranoid about                                 everything at the very least we should                                 be starting to do things like checking                                 the gpg signatures of stuff we                                 downloaded off maven central you know                                 just start being fixing that bit as a                                 core bit of paranoia regarding things                                 aren't apache credentials i am debating                                 whether i should really be doing                                 something like not have them on my                                 laptop at all i really wanted to be                                 nervous I mean cautious about it I would                                 actually keep a separate container or                                 something like that where even if                                 somebody breaks into my laptop it's not                                 bear and then one stop more empowered I                                 would actually be saying I don't run                                 development tools directly in my laptop                                 go run it in a separate vm or container                                 because it is just we're too vulnerable                                 nobody the only reason that we've got                                 away with it so far is nobody really                                 malicious to set out to do it I'm                                 tempted now was tempted as a proof of                                 concept or actually do it but I knew                                 would cause a bit of a upset all around                                 especially with my colleagues you might                                 ask me to leave the building but given                                 that some my colleagues work on the NSA                                 chemo project and I know who else has                                 commit on the Akuma project could be                                 running probably running code in the NSA                                 within two weeks of setting off and that                                 point I would make an enemy of a                                 nation-state and I would die                                 mysteriously in a road accident and                                 that's not really why I'm not going to                                 do it so that is pretty much it i will                                 close by pointing out that despite all                                 this over the message from linkedin                                 saying by the way we stole your unsalted                                 your unsalted hashed password was in                                 fact stolen and they forgot to tell me                                 about it so that's about privacy as well                                 there's the stuff you stick up on the                                 web isn't actually secure either so                                 really                                 you know those people those websites are                                 based around collecting people's                                 personal details they need to care a lot                                 more about privacy too again all the way                                 up the stack so like I say we've lost it                                 can't be fixed at the consumer point all                                 that's left is as developers we have to                                 start thinking about what to do better                                 and we're not even aware right now of                                 what we're doing wrong and finally never                                 trust a free light bulb which has a USB                                 port on the back of it now that in mind                                 because if you do make an enemy of a                                 nation-state that's where they'd go you                                 think you'd be grateful in fact you'd be                                 collecting their data so that's me any                                 questions thanks Steve questions                                 comments there's one of the book                                 um so how do you realistically see this                                 getting solved in and how much time how                                 do I realistic see is being solved I                                 really don't know I think even if I try                                 and do some better compartmentalization                                 of my code at home I'm still running a                                 maven build I'm still creating source                                 code that gets distributed I mean we                                 want to identify better wear those big                                 vulnerabilities are and key one is that                                 whole process of downloading and                                 executing binaries as part of our                                 building release process needs to be                                 looked at we need to be far more                                 paranoid at least about the signatures I                                 think if you want to get involved in                                 this if you're an open source project I                                 would really recommend you actually go                                 on the mailing list that deals with                                 security issues because I am on some of                                 the deeper stuff and you soon discover                                 all these things going on the audits how                                 to fix this stuff like cross-site                                 scripting vulnerabilities a version of                                 HTTP client that's version                                        doesn't check HTTP certificates and all                                 that kind of stuff so getting involved                                 in that stuff will give you greater                                 awareness what's going on there's things                                 like the IRC sans newsfeed is continual                                 security breaches in world and becoming                                 more aware of the problems that is not                                 sufficient to at least fix things at                                 least in that point you'll be vaguely                                 aware of how vulnerable we are and maybe                                 maybe you can come up with some better                                 ideas to fix this okay the problem is is                                 that whenever somebody says security                                 tries to solve the problem they end up                                 producing something that's unusable they                                 end up producing these big container                                 compartmentalised certificate signing                                 mechanisms and all this stuff and it's                                 just it's unworkable and finally we                                 develop as we like naively downloading                                 all the binaries as long as I build                                 takes less than three minutes yeah I                                 don't really know what to do at all                                 actually it's terrifying because you                                 know we are building stuff with no                                 security in naively downloading binaries                                 to help do it and then we're sticking                                 them in cars and televisions which are                                 going to last for a long long time that                                 cars going to be running for another                                 decade from now our previous car dated                                 from the windows XP era and yet it's                                 still out there and you know hope the                                 scenes                                 alright more questions if not then this                                 concludes our session exiled for the                                 attendance we don't have a half of our                                 coffee break and then we'll be meeting                                 you again                                                             very much
