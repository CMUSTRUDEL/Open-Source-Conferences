Description: 
	Yet another key-value store? No, it's an index not a store and it is based on 'Finite State technology', but what does that mean?

Keyvi - the short form for "Key value index" - defines a special subtype of the popular key value store (KVS) technologies. As you can imagine from the name, keyvi is an immutable key value store, therefore an index not a store. Keyvi's strengths: high compression ratio and extreme scalability.

Keyvi powers Cliqz Websearch engine, replacing former engines based on Redis and Elastic Search. Serving terrabytes of data at scale and low-latency, keyvi is already proven technology while still being a young OSS project.

But keyvi is also different to well-established NoSQL engines, it is not an efficient implementation of well-known, common used data structures like hash tables and B-Trees. It brings finite state not only to the same level, but efficiently allows approximate, completion and graph matching to boldy go where NoSQL hasn't gone before.
