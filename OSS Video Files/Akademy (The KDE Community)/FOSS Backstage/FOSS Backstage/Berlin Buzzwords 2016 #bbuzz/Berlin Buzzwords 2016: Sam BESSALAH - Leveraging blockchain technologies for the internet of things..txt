Description: 
	Blockchains are usually assimilated to bitcoins, but in reality they are much more than being the Bitcoin Network backbone.

On one hand, the "Blockchain" can be seen as a distributed, peer to peer log like system, on top of which distributed applications can be built with security, encryption and accountability.

And on the other hand, we are  transitioning to an age of smart devices, with a need to communicate in a Machine to Machine fashion, with security, and scale that make a centralized architecture not viable in the long term.

In this session, we intend to introduce the blockchain as a scalable and secure solution, on top of which critical IoT applications can be built, by using examples from the Ethereum Project to implement smart contracts, and embed more intelligence into smart devices without relying on a centralized system.

	                              like I think many of you here I work as                               a data engineer so my day job is                               actually building data file data                               pipelines using things like cough cough                               links park so I don't do block chains or                               Bitcoin on my day job this is something                               just that I grew up out of interest                               because I'm really passionate about                               distributed systems and what you can do                                with it and Bitcoin beyond the financial                                aspect before I beyond what you can do                                with it today when we do the trading                                aspect of Bitcoin so ah in this talk                                we're going to talk about not especially                                Bitcoin or we'll talk about it but                                mostly block chain and some of the work                                that has been going on to actually use                                blockchain not just for financial                                application like I said like asset                                management but beyond the standard                                application but actually build                                blockchains within connected devices so                                as I said that this is me so just so you                                know I'm not a very very block chain                                expert I just play spend a lot of time                                reading peppers on it working on it for                                fun so bear with me here so today when                                you see what you all over the place all                                of the time you hear people talking                                about block chains for almost everything                                so let's build a block chain for that                                let block chain for this and at some                                point you like okay what exactly do we                                want to do with block chains there's one                                like every technology there comes a time                                when it's over hyped and at some point                                to forget really what we can do with it                                so the main aspect of block chain has                                always been about being things that                                underpins Bitcoin but today it's going                                beyond that so I've had this thing was                                this drawing from Gilbert from did Bert                                was very interesting on on how people                                actually interested in block chains and                                somehow it's evolving too fast and it's                                hard to catch up and like everything                                that's over hype they call the block                                chain or bit coy but trust machine you                                see that you see on all every financial                                publications today that at some point                                you wondering exactly how what are we                                what's the point really with this with                                this block chain                                so sorry let me yeah so before we go                                into blockchain let's say a quick word                                about Bitcoin I'm sure everybody here                                knows about Bitcoin who doesn't know                                about Bitcoin good everyone has good                                good that's that's that so away to it's                                a a peer-to-peer version of money                                actually it's a digital cryptocurrency                                money that's has been created by this                                guy we thought we know him but it's not                                him eventually Satoshi Nakamoto and the                                real Bitcoin get entrapped is beyond                                being a currency a cryptocurrency                                because it's actually a combination of                                many things one of them is that and now                                a peer-to-peer architecture actually                                that you can see like BitTorrent but                                with public cryptography I a concepts                                inside and it's also a secure backbone                                network where all the transactions                                actually public and available for                                everyone and that's secure backbone                                later where all the transactions are                                recorded is called the blockchain so the                                bludgeon is like I said a decentralized                                ledger for all the transactions and it                                underpins very badly if internals of                                Bitcoin network and it wills are out of                                blocks which are actually a batch of                                transactions and they are aligned in a                                sequential manner in a secure energy                                control mouse so what you can see here                                is that one block has a lot of two has a                                batch of transactions and it has a link                                to the previous hash which is a links to                                the next block an order block all over                                that we come back I'll come back a                                little bit on how it works a bit inside                                so one interesting figured with the                                block chain is that every node of this                                distributed ledger has a full copy of                                all the data that inside the block chain                                so you can you appeal to your                                organization you don't have just a                                single property have all the data that                                actually order the data actually in the                                 in the block chain which makes it very                                 interesting compared to what you have                                 with databases that are disputed the                                 database like Cassandra where you can                                 have all the data but not always                                 you can't have all the data of course                                 but you have some part of the data but                                 you can tune your consistency the                                 blockchain is when you write something                                 it's usually broadcasted everywhere so                                 the data is available for everyone in                                 the Indian network and the process of                                 adding a transaction because when you                                 actually using bitcoins on blockchain go                                 to that which is doing our transactions                                 so that's a simple an interesting way to                                 actually do a transaction so when you                                 doing a transaction which is the process                                 of evil buying mind doing anything with                                 Bitcoin you broadcast your transaction                                 that's the first way even nodes will                                 create a block we've with all the                                 transaction that predator has already                                 seen so that's the batch of transaction                                 and it randomly pits when it only picks                                 with the data of love and mud and                                 broadcast it to a and broadcast the                                 block to all over nodes and the other                                 nodes we have to receive and validate                                 this blog and if it's very dated the                                 block to the copy of the change so they                                 had the block they had to validate first                                 block of Attraction actually that's here                                 and then broadcast without                                               the place and then the atoms with copy                                 of the block chain but that's an easy                                 way but in reality it's a bit more                                 complex than that so this is how a real                                 block chain looks like this is the data                                 that contained in the block chain so you                                 have a header that's the public that's                                 the non-encrypted usually part of the                                 block chain and timestamp you have the                                 difficulty have all visitor that's there                                 and you have something inside that's                                 called a miracle tree so for those who                                 do that Cassandra I think you know what                                 the marquetry is so it's very                                 interesting it's very good to summarize                                 and verify the integrity of huge data so                                 that's very fine so they are in many                                 databases anyway and they wilt using                                 cryptographic hashes now in the Bitcoin                                 blockchain what you have today is that                                 all the transaction are actually                                 fingerprinted using a digital digital                                 digital cryptographic key so you can                                 verify them and make them auditable and                                 will the cryptographic hash that's been                                 used in the block chain is something                                 that you will wish are                                              applied twice so usually call it the                                 rubbish sha the shade                                                   that's what you have in a local tree so                                 the way it looks like is that in the                                 block chain like you have something like                                 a linked list you have the mercury woods                                 that's here that's where you have the                                 roots of all the hashes and the data is                                 so installed way below when you have                                 only a one hash at the end that's where                                 you can store the data so you double                                 hash all the way all the way around and                                 this allows you to store many many data                                 in just making just many many                                 transaction or one transaction many men                                 transaction in just one block so that's                                 why we can have actually multiple data                                 in unblock in one block of the of the                                 chin so this is what you have we've we                                 this is what the book shall look like                                 and this is what Roman fur traders so                                 the more country is really important to                                 all the block chain so every time every                                 time you hear about blockchain most of                                 the time when people talks about the                                 architecture of the blockchain you hear                                 about market risk so another problem if                                 you have a distributed architecture like                                 this is how do you solve the issue of                                 consensus so consistent for all of you                                 do that a district system you know that                                 it's a hard problem and the Bitcoin                                 paper and Bitcoin proclaims to actually                                 solve the issue of consensus by solving                                 with non problem of the Byzantine                                 general problem ah that's a lot of                                 discussions will go with that but yes                                 that's that's another thing i'm not                                 going to dive into this kind of thing                                 that the way this term the consensus is                                 for the process called mining so miners                                 are mining is the process where miners                                 create blocks but to create blogs you                                 need to solve an integral integral                                 actually a hard chana a cryptographic                                 challenge which literally actually does                                 to doing real brute brute force that's                                 why when people talk about Bitcoin and                                 block chain they say that it's just                                 about wasting energy because it's so                                 expensive to actually create blog to                                 solve this cryptographic challenge today                                 that mining bitcoin is really expensive                                 and that's challenge of solving of that                                 challenge keeps increasing every time so                                 this is for example this is a graph I                                 don't know if one can see this I took                                 this just a few minutes ago from                                 blockchain that info that actually gives                                 you an idea how the challenge of solving                                 this thing is is growing it's actually                                 expanding so this is a bit hard and this                                 process there's a process called proof                                 of work where you actually have a new                                 blog add a new blog every                                                to do that it's a bit expensive so how                                 does it work you have a big idea is                                 actually to find a hashing key that's                                 less than a certain value so you do a                                 random things that's you hush hush until                                 and it's a really expensive until you                                 get the proper value you lets the proper                                 value of your hash that's below a                                 certain threshold so to sum up how the                                 Bitcoin block chain works is that you                                 have                                                                    broadcast is to all the miners the                                 manners are the ones who create blogs                                 you send your transaction to minors the                                 manners try to create blog the have a                                 puzzle they do the proof of work to say                                 that they have spent enough energy                                 actually to be able to create new value                                 bitcoins and this is the successful                                 manner with broadcast is proof of work                                 to other miners and once the verify it                                 they can restart the process so the                                 Bitcoin block chain is built upon the                                 idea is that creating new blocks has to                                 be a really expensive really costly but                                 verifying your you do with                                               the chef created has to be easy for all                                 over the software for other people so                                 that was bitcoin bitcoin his blah blah                                 that's sometimes what started particular                                 that words that's what that's the basis                                 that's the baseline that's we're trying                                 to emulate today we've it's a block                                 chain but bitcoin has actually sprung a                                 lot of over al Cowen's not meaning other                                 cryptocurrencies that look like Bitcoin                                 but are not really bit gods and that                                 those over cryptocurrencies actually                                 come with their own block chain and one                                 of the most heard of blockchain today                                 let's we've been talking about easy                                 theorem block chain                                 it's a a new project but it's girls                                 actually beyond what you have with                                 Bitcoin it's a huge block chain and what                                 you can do with advantage of actually                                 having III reham ET arrium is actually                                 because it's really versatile and it                                 works unlisted of contracts contracts                                 actually code that has that can be                                 executed that's stored on the blockchain                                 on each one block chain and can be                                 executed at one by automatically                                 executed and those country contracts do                                 not have to be financial application                                 they don't have to be currencies don't                                 have to be bit going there'll have to be                                 money they can be any type of                                 application that you can write actually                                 so you can build with those contracts                                 things like currencies of watching                                 systems financial district and financial                                 derivatives make talk a lot of                                 applications or either what we call                                 today decentralized application so                                 basically what the interim block chain                                 is is the block chain for all everything                                 all type of application that's what you                                 can do with it so at the core of the                                 atrium is what's called a smart contract                                 but on the Bitcoin blockchain the                                 currency is Bitcoin that's the unit of                                 computing there that's the Bitcoin in                                 this in the HMO it's called eater so                                 ether is what is what's actually poor as                                 well underlying blockchain so what you                                 have is smart contracts smart contracts                                 is actually a simple application a block                                 of code that actually stored on the                                 block chain so what you do is that to                                 call a smart contracts like you have an                                 idea here i Wasi groups have an address                                 which is a little bit clearer the                                 balance donated so you still have the                                 idea of actually money but that money is                                 a little bit eater but that's not the                                 point here but what you have is that you                                 call that contract and when it's done                                 the execution stop the moment that mode                                 that amount is gone now you can use                                 smart contracts between without eater                                 that's okay it just looks that's called                                 a an account so                                 in the Bitcoin you have money you have                                 accounts while let's see this kind of                                 things I didn't talk about them but this                                 is what you have a smart contract with a                                 little bit what it looks like so here                                 what you have it's just a huge a small                                 amount of data with an address I balance                                 some fields that you can have this is a                                 smart contracted did at a hackathon in                                 Paris for a meetup which actually a                                 meetup smart contract we use a                                 blockchain to actually count count when                                 other people attending meet ups or not                                 so just for the sake of fun of it so you                                 can have an event one I don't know if                                 you decide to meetup com but we wanted                                 to build something like that but totally                                 decentralized but using rupture so this                                 is what the smart contract of a meter                                 looked like so it's just a balance and                                 address methods events and this you can                                 write some codes inside of it those that                                 code is called a decentralized                                 application that's contained inside the                                 smart contract and to write smart                                 contracts you have a lot of application                                 another way to do that I have a lot of                                 languages the most the most popular one                                 that's actually supported by the                                 platform is called solidity it looks                                 it's not very hi jata Hodge looks like                                 javascript anyway and on top of solidity                                 they have built a lot of other contracts                                 that's a lot of other things that's like                                 a framework a JavaScript framework                                 called web free which stands for the wii                                 decentralized web but is an application                                 on top of that so here's the code and                                 this is how it's actually translated                                 within the within the secret i'll be in                                 the code inside a tree on blockchain so                                 here i can write a simple contract for                                 older what I'm going to transfer all the                                 data just the simple code that looks                                 like really nothing in particular and                                 like I said you can build the                                 centralized application centralized                                 application actually composed on front                                 end where you can interact and the back                                 and restore the back end is usually a                                 simple block chain so what you do is                                 that you write a solidity contract which                                 looks like the language here on that you                                 have there yeah sorry that you had that                                 you have there and you compile them                                 using web                                                      and then you can try on locally locally                                 you can create your own III on                                 blockchain that looks that it's usually                                 called a test shin or or or a private                                 each run network so that's something                                 that's local and then you can push them                                 later on using these tools into the                                 global HR on blockchain so each one                                 block down as you can see here has as                                 many implementation that the freemen                                 implementation today have the goo                                 implementation of the etm + pi the bikes                                 on a tray of the bite on implementation                                 and the original one in c++ we see why                                 i'm talking about this in a minute and                                 the ghoul yttrium platform it's very                                 interesting because it runs on many                                 platforms on linux OS x and especially                                 on arm which makes sense because we've                                 tried to run these kind of things on                                 small devices with low power and since                                 each room I can do whatever I like and                                 one thing I didn't talk is that's when                                 it comes to performance on the Bitcoin                                 blockchain you have to wait                                            for a transition to appear to all the                                 other nodes within a of each one block                                 chain it takes something close to                                    seconds it's a little bit more                                 performance so this is the atrium                                 implementation in go which is itself                                 very entry which is which in itself is                                 quite interesting so like I said you                                 have you can take them and run them in                                 multiple in multiple platforms that's                                 what makes this the interest in hand                                 since its goal it has a lot of memory                                 footprint so it works very well on small                                 devices with low I with low power so                                 what you what we actually have of                                 blockchain is something that's secure                                 transparent have a dispute consensus and                                 something well that's auditable and                                 since we add burswood the block chain                                 being one best boards let's talk in LA                                 but another bus world which is the                                 Internet of Things I think other unless                                 you've been living under a rock you have                                 heard but I would T I mean that's all                                 over the place so they predicting that                                 we have will have a huge amount of                                 connected devices in the coming                                 in the coming monday coming years I                                 still haven't seen not seeing them all                                 over the places but they're predicting                                 that we have many of them so that's nice                                 already and they're everywhere literally                                 so on thermometer on your phone you have                                 things like this I simple Raspberry Pi                                 and yes they're all over the place so                                 look the most popular one when you want                                 to have fun if you have to tinker with                                 with IOT you take small things like this                                 is the Raspberry Pi portal which is                                 another computer it has one gig of ram                                 and all of the things inside and you can                                 take or do arduino which is really a                                 microcontroller but it reads way more                                 limited than what you have in our                                 Raspberry Pi and what you have today is                                 that we have consumer electronics that                                 are network so that was the first of the                                 first wave and we have industry that are                                 actually connected through all the                                 devices that is wise the devices are                                 talking to each other and the first wave                                 is that everything that's coming up is                                 going to have a devices connected to the                                 internet so that's apparently what we                                 going and the only issue is that what                                 you usually have today is that all of                                 the design all of these devices want to                                 try to talk to each other they have to                                 go for the internet but what I called                                 Internet of Things so they always have                                 some way to go for a central authority                                 and other things that has been seeing                                 lately is that you have a lot of                                 security gaps in the coyote world so                                 like Jeep calling our many many a lot of                                 his vehicles to fix some of the bugs and                                 even people hacking your frigerators I                                 mean why do you hurt my dear why would                                 you want to do that but yes since                                 everything is something is connected to                                 the Internet today that always is a                                 security issue so IBM came up with this                                 thing is that the limitation today is                                 that you have broken business models                                 when it comes to internet surveys lack                                 of privacy the not future proof and                                 they're very expensive to deploy                                 so what you want to do is actually                                 change that and what you usually have                                 before is that all the centralized                                 attended IOT networks talk to a central                                 authority today they talk to the cloud                                 but it still centralized and what you                                 want tomorrow is actually all this                                 application to actually be totally                                 decentralized so how do we come to a                                 place where all I OT devices are                                 completely decentralized so Samsung and                                 IBM came up with a project called adept                                 project publish a paper on it it's a                                 simple proof of concept but what they                                 want to do is actually good tackle some                                 of the challenges in the IOT world the                                 costs will lack of trust how to monetize                                 interoperability discovery or toxic                                 ations and all of these problems that                                 actually we know today that's drawn                                 invitation when it comes to IOT and what                                 they actually want to see is something                                 that you build you want they want to                                 build digital market places within                                 connected device an economy of devices                                 but that are actually intelligence so                                 willed intro device agreements direct                                 payments between devices and service                                 resources between those devices and the                                 good thing is that they came up of a                                 demo but so long ago so it was kind of                                 interesting and they came up with an                                 architecture where you have multiple                                 layers well you have devices that use                                 blockchain technology to actually                                 communicate with each other and the                                 layer where you can build application                                 now not going to dive into this but this                                 is just a simple idea so one of the use                                 case that came up with is to actually                                 have a dishwasher dishwasher no a away                                 as a washing machine so the washing                                 machine actually buys itself detergent                                 if it lacks so what it does is it using                                 ether money to make orders using a                                 blockchain to buy automatically are the                                 Trojans because it's lagging so that's                                 what it's going today this it makes it                                 stupid idea but it's a good way to start                                 on the funny thing is that they come up                                 of the real video at CES in January that                                 actually demoed this thing so it's kind                                 of fun and it's working quite well so                                 the device is not going to make the                                 order to check                                 John's going to notify the user of owner                                 of the device about the lack of the lack                                 of detergent and make a service request                                 to a service van drove through the block                                 chain and the same thing they can                                 validate the one the warranty through                                 the vendors actually in the same way so                                 you have devices what you have in the                                 complete decentralize economy not just                                 between people actually using the blood                                 chamber even devices actually going for                                 the abrupt change themselves so it's the                                 same thing and what they actually came                                 up with is a universal digital digital                                 ledger so like able still still a                                 blockchain specified for the digital                                 devices where you can register device or                                                                                                 contracts to actually have device make                                 make Emma make the cooperation between                                 themselves and a lot of other things so                                 this is just a proof concept but it says                                 that there's something that can be done                                 with this and like I said today most I                                 think are either centralized or see my                                 centralized but you want something that                                 really decentralized but it comes with a                                 security risk as well and you have                                 domain problem if I ET today is really                                 security so that these consortium called                                 channel things that did something                                 similar to what you have we've with IBM                                 but they use solar power solar meals so                                 instead they actually use a way to load                                 the data and to prove that you can                                 secure the speed these layers they added                                 some checks and some some challenges to                                 be to work on this is still a working                                 project in progress so you have solar                                 middle that actually gets the data push                                 the data inside a block chair it's using                                 this is instead of having a theory on                                 this is the block the Bitcoin block                                 chain so they're using something called                                 bit seed which is a connected devices                                 you connect device with a blockchain                                 already inside so I just have to connect                                 it goes through the block chain itself                                 and its sit still do something so the                                 main problem the to try to serve is                                 actually to have to check about the                                 first auto type authenticity                                 authenticity of the data and how do you                                 manage security between the data from                                 the devices to the lasers                                 and how do you maintain that data                                 security and how do you share those                                 translation so does a still question                                 that people are still working on but                                 today you can do that yeah with enjoy                                 yourself so if you want to get started                                 if you want to do your own IOT                                 blockchain but put something like                                 etherium in a raspberry device in were                                 speeding for example there's a way                                 actually just going to resp node you                                 download a specific distribution aware                                 you have can all you can order a                                 specific raspberry pie with all with                                 abduction already inside or you can go                                 yourself within your own raspberry and I                                 style any tea on blockchain within yo yo                                 yo yourself that's something that's                                 quite easy to do it's just a linux                                 command and then you can write your                                 smart contract I'm going to be just like                                 it a little bit so a smirk on a smart                                 contract is actually quite easy this is                                 just a blinker you use something like                                 web free the one that I mentioned you                                 have a debit card is straightforward                                 just JavaScript anyway you can write the                                 same thing and go as well so you have                                 other bindings for that and then check                                 the connection to to your blood to go to                                 to to the blockchain your contract                                 address I'm sorry oh yeah sorry okay                                 so the code is really is really not hard                                 so yes this is it and just go on the                                 internet writing a simple smart contract                                 and then using these two Pusha T to push                                 a contract within on each one block                                 chain it was quite a quite handily it's                                 not it's really has so here are plagued                                 with in both the the blinking of the                                 blocks and this was supposed to actually                                 light a set up a lightning between a                                 light between our                                                        so and since we're in Berlin I don't                                 know but that this company called slug                                 it if which are okay yeah it's a bit                                 slow this this is company called slow                                 kids and smoke it is actually a startup                                 that start actually building et rien                                 computer actually the building a an                                 embedded device egnater i'm using ubuntu                                 snappy that's a small a lowly Lupo a                                 low-power able to platform and within it                                 within this is what these devices they                                 actually built a home computer and now                                 they going for something a little bit                                 bigger that's good with deal I think I                                 don't know if you heard about it that's                                 the decentralized autonomous organism or                                 organization basically it's building                                 total distant relies organization                                 without central authorities but it                                 raised a lot of money but the using each                                 one block chain for that but there are                                 people actually some people i work with                                 were actually experiencing this to                                 actually have a deal a deal but for                                 connected devices so that's all ahead so                                 thank you for listening if you have any                                 question but thank you sir                                 we indeed have                                                         of who wants to fire the first one speak                                 to heart it seems I have one I in the                                 last at the last PI data conference                                 there was um Trent I can't remember his                                 surname I'm talking about a new                                 blockchain database called blockchain DB                                 have you got agenda the big                                    regardless if I know about big chanderi                                 it's a really interesting project                                 actually you see that the thing the guys                                 on the Big Ten did we try to do instead                                 of going for I have a blockchain and                                 then build a database or that access                                 layer on top of it like you would think                                 to do they want with a distributed                                 database and added the concept of block                                 chains on top of it so they try to                                 enhance to take the good ideas that have                                 into block chain but actually creates a                                 database it's still in its infancy I                                 haven't used it for real application yet                                 but it's something that's going to                                 select albicans right so it's very nice                                 and I think they're picking up some                                 steam now because when people are                                 interested actually having block chain                                 is not just for photo project like I do                                 offer for Bitcoin mining these kind of                                 things but actually for storing data                                 because the idea is out there because                                 you have limitation that you have to in                                 most data today's have privacy autumn                                 what is the ability with this kind of                                 thing so bringing them into the world of                                 databases it's quite interesting and one                                 good thing one thing for example that's                                 going on is actually people building                                 data processing for risk for risk well                                 for some you have derivatives of                                 financial risk using the debt level of a                                 block chain or Bitcoin or eater for that                                 but actually using loop or devices that                                 run the processing in the Bitcoin in do                                 in in the in the block chain so they're                                 doing this kind of work I think we still                                 at the very beginning of this kind the                                 steel rod talk when it comes to                                 blockchain technology today but there                                 are still there are also real projects                                 going on diction TV is a nice a nice                                 project as well                                 any more questions I guess okay so thank                                 you very much for coming let's thank you                                 Sam one more time
