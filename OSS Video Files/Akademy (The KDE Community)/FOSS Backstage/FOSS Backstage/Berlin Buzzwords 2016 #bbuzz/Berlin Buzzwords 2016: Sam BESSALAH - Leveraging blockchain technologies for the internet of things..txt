Description: 
	Blockchains are usually assimilated to bitcoins, but in reality they are much more than being the Bitcoin Network backbone.

On one hand, the "Blockchain" can be seen as a distributed, peer to peer log like system, on top of which distributed applications can be built with security, encryption and accountability.

And on the other hand, we are  transitioning to an age of smart devices, with a need to communicate in a Machine to Machine fashion, with security, and scale that make a centralized architecture not viable in the long term.

In this session, we intend to introduce the blockchain as a scalable and secure solution, on top of which critical IoT applications can be built, by using examples from the Ethereum Project to implement smart contracts, and embed more intelligence into smart devices without relying on a centralized system.
