Description: 
	Stephan Ewen talking about "The Stream Processor as a Database: Building Online Applications directly on Streams with Apache Flink and Apache Kafka".

We present a new design pattern for data streaming applications, using Apache Flink and Apache Kafka: Building applications directly on top of the stream processor, rather than on top of key / value databases populated by data streams.

Unlike classical setups that use stream processors or libraries to pre-process / aggregate events and update a database with the results, this setup simply gives the role of the database to the stream processor - here Apache Flink -, routing queries to its workers who directly answer them from their internal state computed over the log of events - Apache Kafka.
