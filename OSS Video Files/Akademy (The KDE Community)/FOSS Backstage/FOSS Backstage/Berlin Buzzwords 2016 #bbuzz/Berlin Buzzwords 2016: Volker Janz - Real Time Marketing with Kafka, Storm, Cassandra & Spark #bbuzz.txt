Description: 
	The combination of Apache Kafka as a event bus, Apache Storm for real- or neartime processing, Apache Cassandra as an operational storage layer as well as Apache Spark to perform analytical queries against this storage turned out to be a extremely well performing system.

With increasing marketing costs per registration, it is even more important to keep players within the game as well as provide them with attractive offers aiming to increase the customer lifetime value and also create a better game experience.

To that end, we introduced interstitials that offer premium features or discounts for the player at InnoGames. Even though this is already a useful instrument, we aimed to customize those interstitials according to the behavior of the player. Therefore, we created a system that works with generic messages that contain data about user interactions, in real- or neartime -- later referred to as events. The system builds up a player profile that contains all game-relevant information about the players in a central location.
