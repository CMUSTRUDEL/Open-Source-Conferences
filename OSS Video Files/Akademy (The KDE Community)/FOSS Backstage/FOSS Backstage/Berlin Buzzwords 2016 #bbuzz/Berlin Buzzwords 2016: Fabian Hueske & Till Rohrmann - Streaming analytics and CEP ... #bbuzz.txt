Description: 
	Complex event processing (CEP) and stream analytics are commonly treated as distinct classes of stream processing applications. While CEP workloads identify patterns from event streams in near real-time, stream analytics queries ingest and aggregate high-volume streams. Both types of use cases have very different requirements which resulted in diverging system designs. CEP systems excel at low-latency processing whereas engines for stream analytics achieve high throughput usually due to distributed scale-out architectures.

Recent advances in open source stream processing yielded systems that can process several millions of events per second at sub-second latency. Systems like Apache Flink enable applications that include typical CEP features as well as heavy aggregations. An example of these use cases is an application that ingests network monitoring events, identifies access patterns such as intrusion attempts using CEP technology, and analyzes and aggregates identified access patterns.

In this talk we will show how Apache Flink unifies CEP and stream analytics workloads. Guided by examples, we introduce Flinkâ€™s CEP-enriched StreamSQL interface and discuss how queries are compiled, optimized, and executed on Flink.
