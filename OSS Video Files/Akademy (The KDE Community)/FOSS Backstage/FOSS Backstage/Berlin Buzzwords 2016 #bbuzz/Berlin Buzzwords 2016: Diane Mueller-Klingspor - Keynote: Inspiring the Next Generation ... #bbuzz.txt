	                              well good morning and welcome to Berlin                               buzzwords I'm really pleased to be                               invited here today I'm going to try and                               talk a little bit about what we're doing                               to inspire the next generation of folks                               to come in and join this wonderful                               circus of software and hardware                               development that we're working on I work                               on red hat for red hat my day job I work                                on openshift and OpenStack and Cooper                                Nettie's and docker and all that good                                stuff but I'm not going to talk about                                any of that this morning I'm coming off                                a weekend of Maker Faires we just hosted                                our second annual Maker Faire this is a                                kind of a cloudy map but this is then                                just north of vancouver in British                                Columbia Canada which I flew in from                                yesterday so it's about twelve-thirty                                a.m. my time so I'm standing up which is                                a good thing this is our second Maker                                Faire that we did on the coast I'm about                                a                                                                       in from Vancouver BC if you know the                                west coast of Canada and where I live is                                about five communities which make up                                about                                                                 in everything and we had over a thousand                                of them show up for a one-day Maker                                Faire and so what we've been do what's                                been happening and if any of any of you                                live in cities you realize that it's                                very expensive to live in the cities and                                a lot of people are migrating up to the                                coast and so we're getting a lot of tech                                folks and so the Sunshine Coast is                                actually the fastest growing maker                                community in all of Canada right now and                                this is the crew that I work with on                                it's probably your call the Coast makers                                and we're the ones that put it on                                there's a whole bunch more but this was                                the only ones i could get to come around                                and for the picture that we're opposing                                that day and we're called the coast                                makers and we do all this stuff but i                                started a project in collaboration with                                all the coast makers called get maker                                labs and what i do in my day job is i'm                                a technology evangelist and a community                                manager or otherwise known as a cat                                herder i try and get folks to work on my                                open source projects and so i'm taking                                some of those                                bills and using that to teach teachers                                and teach students how to teach tech in                                the school systems and what we've been                                doing is creating mobile maker spaces                                and those mobile maker spaces are using                                some new concepts called connected                                learning which comes out of Stanford                                University and I'm going to talk a                                little bit about that today and how                                we're using these things to try and get                                to the next level and the next                                generation of people who will be doing                                the jobs that you're doing so your                                replacements is what I'm trying to                                inspire um so first a bit of history                                because I'm always shocked at how long                                I've managed to stay in this business                                and about a year ago I was in the                                computer computer history museum down in                                Silicon Valley and if you ever get a                                chance please go it's wonderful the sad                                thing is i'm in the history museum so                                when i started my career back in the                                early                                                          University was working for Nike i love                                to call them the sneaker people they                                like to be called the athletic footwear                                people and i did all of the cad cam and                                cnc machining work to do the souls of                                sneakers so sneaker bottoms these things                                and it was really fun used all the math                                skills that I inspires and curves and                                all that kind of fun stuff and the                                machine that i sat on and that that the                                big huge tube and the CNC machines cost                                over a million dollars just for my one                                place that I was sitting out with the                                software the training all the                                connectivity and all of that has now                                been commoditized so this is this is                                actually one of the molds that I worked                                on it's really and truly in the history                                museum but someday I'd like to retire                                and you know I I do all this community                                development stuff because basically what                                 I'm looking for is I'm looking for my                                 replacement so when I was at University                                 back in                                                                  in a computer science class a group that                                 going through as freshmen                                 and I'd like to see many more of us                                 going through computer science this is                                 my daughter I have to two girls there                                 now                                                                      other ones two years into high school                                 and what I started noticing was in the                                 school system where they were going they                                 were getting very bored in the IT                                 classes or with computer class and when                                 I asked and actually one of them this                                 one hailey was kind of getting a bad                                 grade and so I work in tech and my wife                                 she's also a web designer so heck what's                                 going on here these kids should be like                                 acing this class and when I went in to                                 talk to the teachers about my problem                                 child what it was is they were teaching                                 the kids how to do PowerPoint they                                 weren't doing anything interesting and                                 it wasn't the teachers fault it was                                 really and it wasn't the kids fall it                                 was just the training and the background                                 that the teachers were getting and the                                 time that they are getting to do this                                 was was not sufficient so what we did                                 instead of you know giving heck to the                                 teachers we decided that we would do                                 something about that because it wasn't                                 just the teachers in the elementary                                 schools and the high schools but also AM                                 if you're in North America they're                                 currently declining enrollments in                                 education around engineering computer                                 science not just for women but for                                 everybody kids are not choosing to go                                 into computer science anymore and or                                 into engineering or into that so it's                                 there's a episode of a problem that's at                                 the center of all of this that we've                                 really got to get to how do we get kids                                 inspired to work on the things that are                                 going to make our lives better as we get                                 older and bring in the new innovation so                                 we're trying to figure out this problem                                 and then there was another problem                                 between like web designers like my wife                                 and other people do the really cool                                 stuff right mobile apps do use right all                                 the services that run on top of things a                                 really beautiful UI and fun stuff                                 versus the people who are building                                 infrastructure and so we really wanted                                 to get kids to understand the                                 underpinnings of the things that they                                 were working on and to get to people to                                 think like that to think not just on the                                 surface level not just to use their                                 iphones or their iPads or their xboxes                                 things think about how things work                                 inside so I work for red hat so I have                                 to throw a Linux picture in here so                                 Linux it's not so much fun to work on if                                 you're a linux kernel person and the                                 Linux kernel communities idea of                                 recruiting people is giving them popcorn                                 and it didn't work you know that's not                                 going to get a kid to start working on                                 the linux kernel so we had to do                                 something more so we came up with this                                 idea wasn't just mine kids really like                                 circuses all right so what we thought we                                 would do is bring the circus to them but                                 still when you have a circus somebody                                 has to build the tent somebody has to                                 put the tent up someone has to provide                                 the services that are going to be used                                 underneath those tents so starting to                                 teach all of the concepts that take it                                 to the next level because if we don't                                 start teaching those kids and inspiring                                 them to be take part in those other                                 pieces of the infrastructure and a                                 project we're going to end up with                                 bridges that don't work no services and                                 the train stations and things like that                                 so there's really a compelling argument                                 for all of you to get involved in your                                 kids education and the education systems                                 around around you because if you don't                                 do this it's not just about inspiring                                 the next generation it's about inspiring                                 you all out there to get involved in                                 your schools and in yours in your kids                                 education and in your neighborhood maker                                 spaces because I it's berlin buzzword so                                 i had to put one buzzword in there okay                                 so stem the science tech in engineering                                 and maths is really a very key thing in                                 at least in north america that's one of                                 the things next year in our british                                 columbia school system it's mandated                                 that STEM education is part                                 the first time the interesting thing                                 about it is there's no training for the                                 teachers so they mandating it to be part                                 of the curriculum but there's no extra                                 training so there was some work to be                                 done here and I'm just going to pause                                 for a minute to because the thing about                                 it is a lot of people think and there                                 are some great programs out there girls                                 that code lady pi PI ladies all kinds of                                 one of the things a lot of people think                                 about getting kids into stem is teaching                                 kids to code and I'd actually ask you to                                 step back and think about the first time                                 you really got that this stuff was cool                                 that you're working on today like for me                                 when I was I think i was ten my                                 grandfather lived in germany and he                                 would send Christmas presents back to my                                 brother and I and he was getting a                                 little bit older and he mixed up our                                 ages and he sent my six-year-old brother                                 a electronics kit to build one of those                                 old-fashioned phones you know you lift                                 off the receiver and my dad who was an                                 engineer and German swapped the gifts it                                 was the only thing that he did different                                 he gave me the telephone kid and I put                                 it together with his help and I started                                 to see everything that was inside of a                                 telephone it was the first time I was                                 ten you know I'd never seen electronics                                 I'd never been allowed to take a phone                                 apart or do any of those sorts of things                                 but it wasn't what I call an epiphany a                                 magic moment a connection with my dad                                 and um connection with the technology                                 that underneath the thing not today if                                 you take apart your iPhone it didn't you                                 know it breaks the warranty right if you                                 really really you take part anything                                 like that it's you know that's it that's                                 the end of it you crack the glass it's                                 gone believe me I have daughters and                                 I've seen them dropped and toilets in                                 lakes and oceans and everything so                                 that's not a magical experience so we                                 have to figure out where we can find                                 those epiphany moments so rather than                                 focusing on you know getting                                         olds to learn how to do scratch which is                                 a great thing or to use other                                 programming what I've been focusing on                                 is trying to figure out that how to                                 bring                                 magical moment to the kids that will                                 connect them with technology in a way                                 that will have continued through the                                 rest of their lives because the                                 traditional method of teaching we've all                                 been there most of us didn't have the                                 opportunity to go through alternative                                 schools so normally you sit like you are                                 in the theater today and you get it gets                                 pushed out on to you you're just the                                 consumer you don't get to control what                                 actually is being taught you don't drive                                 the agenda the agenda is so you're going                                 to pass these exams so you need to know                                 these things and it's a lot of abstract                                 concepts and it's very what I would say                                 surface learning oops one time too many                                 so learning is a process and for me it                                 it is a very social process if you                                 remember the time that you spent in your                                 classes and everything it was about                                 being with your peers peer pressure all                                 that good stuff and the environment in                                 which you learn makes a really big                                 difference so if you're sitting at a                                 wooden desk with an inkwell and you know                                 things aren't getting aren't advancing                                 with the technology that you have at                                 home things are going to be not jiving                                 in terms of what they want to learn and                                 lots of people learn in different ways                                 and so when you're organizing programs                                 for people you have to accommodate them                                 and if people aren't comfortable in a                                 classroom or if they're afraid of                                 technology you have to accommodate for                                 that as well so for me teaching and this                                 kind of falls into that community                                 development stuff that I do during my                                 day job is about organizing people and                                 the environment in which they are                                 learning in so there's a concept as i                                 mentioned that came out of stanford                                 university that i'm very in love with in                                 terms of teaching connected learning so                                 what we're trying to do is create                                 interactive experiences that are                                 collaborative so the kids are working                                 with each other they're working with the                                 teachers they're working across                                 generations they're doing very practical                                 things so they make stuff and they take                                 their ideas and their ideas or what                                 drive the curriculum or the agenda of                                 the day of the workshop there are never                                 seen as being pushed on they are the                                 co-creators in this space so this is                                 really kind of import important and                                 they're leveraging their peer networks                                 so they're working with kids their own                                 age they're leveraging and what we have                                 in British Columbia is called the cool                                 schools or the leadership programs and                                 some high schools so we bring in kids of                                 different ages so it's not the adult                                 running the course so so what we try and                                 do and is get the kids to teach each                                 other so we work with some of the older                                 kids then we once someone's gone through                                 a workshop we make them the teachers for                                 the next workshop so we've been doing a                                 lot of work around this these are ten                                 year old girls that are teaching each                                 other a software package called                                 Tinkercad and they're creating some of                                 these wonderful printable things and one                                 of the things we're really hot on is you                                 can download a rubber duck or a Hello                                 Kitty icon and printed it from                                 thingiverse or one of the many other                                 things but what we're trying to do is                                 add have them modify the images so if                                 you look closely here they've put their                                 name on and they've put a different base                                 on and they've done stuff and they'd not                                 even really aware that we're teaching                                 them                                                                   Tinkercad they're just using it and it's                                 not gamifying because they're using real                                 tools but they're just doing things that                                 kids do naturally they're exploring the                                 tools and they're the ones that decide                                 what they're going to put on it how                                 they're going to extend it not not us by                                 any means so the other thing that we do                                 is we take because printing this is one                                 lesson that we learn that printing                                 things takes even one of these little                                 small ones takes about an hour an hour                                 and a half so instead be I'm not sure                                 how bright this is the kids created an                                 unreal engine game                                 and drop their images into the Unreal                                 Engine and started playing and much to                                 my surprise the girls were creating                                 first-person shooter games and shooting                                 themselves so yeah ponytail sweetness                                 and light and guns and we weren't in                                 America we were in Canada so so there's                                 a lot of this stuff is going on so all                                 this connected learning is as stuff that                                 I've learned in the past two and a half                                 years of doing some of these workshops                                 and the other thing that's going on at                                 the same time is this whole maker                                 movement you've got Fab Lab hear                                 something called beta something or other                                 here in Berlin and these are wonderful                                 things this whole maker movement has                                 changed the way that we think about it                                 it's like basically took taking what my                                 dad did for me at                                              accidentally on purpose I think because                                 he was an engineer he was going to make                                 an engineer out of one of us two kids my                                 brother's a musician so but what the                                 makers do is they make cool stuff and                                 make all kinds of stuff we play with                                 Arduino zand minnow boards and raspberry                                 pies and all kinds of fun stuff but it's                                 mostly boys if you ever go into a                                 makerspace it's kind of intimidating                                 though everybody is very                                 well-intentioned it's very intimidating                                 for a ten-year-old girl to go into one                                 of those spaces and an emoti sty was                                 just in Austin Texas a couple weeks ago                                 and not only that but there's an age                                 thing you have to be there with a parent                                 and if you're not if you're not over                                    you have to bring a parent you have to                                 sign a waiver and there's like all this                                 extra stuff so it's pretty cool then                                 then there's more cool stuff at Maker                                 Faires but those are mostly in big                                 cities we did start our own within our                                 things but there one off so it happens                                 one time a year and that's not enough if                                 you're trying to get people to have                                 epiphany moments we did we headed over a                                 thousand kids go through our workshops                                 and was a one day sunday event and which                                 was amazing because there's only                                        people that I mentioned that in the                                 entire Coast and a thousand of of their                                 kids showed up and they came not just                                 from our communities on the coast but                                 some of the I                                 and from downtown Vancouver as well it                                 was pretty amazing but it was really a                                 one-time event and then there's maker                                 spaces which are great but it's kind of                                 for me a zoo versus circuses so the zoo                                 is where you keep the geeks and you put                                 them in the zoo and people come to it                                 and the circuses are the Maker Faires so                                 we bring that and we set them up for                                 them right now so I think of them the                                 problem for us with maker spaces with                                 only having                                                       they're in Berlin you can do that you                                 have enough center of gravity enough                                 people to actually join and be part of                                 and pay for the rental costs and all                                 that but there are fixed locations and                                 there's a lot of overhead for us to do                                 that it doesn't quite work when you have                                 a community a rural community that                                 spread across an entire coastline and                                 for us and british columbia we have not                                 only the schools to think about but the                                 First Nations kids that are living in on                                 the reservations and on band lands that                                 we want to reach we have islands that we                                 have to get to we have fairies that we                                 have to take we're very distributed                                 Canada is a vast country and there's a                                 lot of people in very rural situations                                 that aren't going to have enough money                                 or enough bandwidth to actually be able                                 to have a zoo for geeks so we were                                 trying to figure out two things besides                                 how do we deal with this that the high                                 overhead for the cost for the maker                                 space but also to give them a ticket                                 into the zoo all right so you want to                                 have that epiphany moment but you also                                 want to give them something that's the                                 excuse to go into a makerspace or to go                                 the next step beyond just doing the                                 one-time workshop at a maker faire and                                 so we decided that we would bring the                                 circus to them and so what we did was we                                 took a                                                                  completely and put inside of it a lab                                 to                                                                     I'll show you some pictures of all this                                 in a minute and we built this out                                 together and we decided that we would                                 try and create a very welcoming                                 environment there are little Persian                                 rugs inside there's a couch there's a                                 pink point there's always a pink pony                                 there's usually a knitter outside like                                 in Tale of Two Cities taking the names                                 just trying to make the atmosphere very                                 laid-back not clinical not like a lab                                 but something really friendly that                                 anybody would walk in the door to so the                                 other piece of it was not only were we                                 trying to bring this space to them but                                 what we wanted to do was not intimidate                                 the teachers because some of the                                 teachers hadn't had tech training before                                 some of the lot of the teachers are                                 women who haven't had don't have that                                 didn't have that epiphany moment that I                                 had at                                                                  you really have to work with the                                 teachers and get them on board find the                                 champions in the school systems and have                                 them understand the technology well                                 enough so that then they can host the                                 trailer coming to them and host the                                 workshops and so a lot of the time that                                 is a front time teaching teachers about                                 the technology so I've done things like                                 host a wine and cheese night at my house                                 with a trailer and everybody's sipping                                 wine and they're scanning each other                                 they're doing the work and they're                                 getting they're figuring out how to run                                 one of these workshops because the other                                 thing is inside the trailer it's a very                                 simple setup it's not it's not perfect                                 okay so i'm not making perfect                                          of people i'm doing something that's                                 rather low budget we're using xbox                                 connects we're not trying to make the                                 perfect scan because that's one teachers                                 can't afford that they can't afford they                                 can't replicate that so you have to                                 think about what it is that you're                                 bringing to them can they replicate it                                 can they host it themselves can they                                 build it out themselves so what we did                                 was we built a                                                           knows what                                 Althea's everybody's taken a selfie so                                 the recognition of or what the idea is                                 here and we didn't say that it was any                                 more than that and there were five steps                                 that we're trying to teach to them to                                 the kids one is scanning creating a                                    image so this is making something other                                 than a rubber duck or a Hello Kitty                                 model or a Lego chip something that they                                 could actually see themselves and you                                 get to see yourself in                                                  time the first time I ever saw myself in                                                                                                        folks had were hosting something and                                 they did me in                                                         believe how bad my posture was I was                                 standing like this and in the model like                                 that's not me but it is me but you don't                                 realize that you've never seen yourself                                 in                                                                     then there's cleaning it up modding it                                 slicing it and printing it and so that's                                 what we'd like to do this is me inside                                 of the trailer we're using Xbox Kinect                                 you can see some there this is the human                                 sized turntable that we built out it                                 goes around rather slowly it's portable                                 so we don't have to keep it we can take                                 it out of there we can move it someplace                                 else and basically it's a single Xbox                                 Kinect hooked up to a machine a larger                                 desktop machine that's running Windows                                                                                                      running windows                                                          has some wonderful software now if                                 anybody opens at stl file on a Windows                                                                                                       into                                                                     not open source yet though so we're                                 going to work on that what is another                                 piece of software that if you don't want                                 to use the windows you can use the older                                 version of xbox connects and they'll                                 work wonderful with some software called                                 schenectady builder though does                                 full-color scans and that's pretty cool                                 so one of the things that we also teach                                 them about is cleaning up software and                                 there's a software package called mesh                                 labs that we use and we teach kids how                                 to when you scan someone if you miss the                                 top of their heads often they'll be a                                 hole in                                 your head and that's where the light                                 comes in and we teach them how to clean                                 them up so that they get the next stage                                 so and we're doing all this and they                                 don't really realize that we're teaching                                 them like new skills or anything they                                 just want the scan they want themselves                                 printed in                                                        themselves inside of the games so um                                 this woman is Emily she's she and her                                 husband who's                                                         and it brings me to another point about                                 the age we we tend to focus on just                                 bringing these experiences to kids and                                 making kids but when we bring these                                 these workshops to folks the                                 grandparents come the ground pants are                                 bringing the kids it's just really                                 starting to think about the spread of                                 the ages of people that you can inspire                                 and get addicted to some of this so we                                 teach the kids using Tinkercad which is                                 from Autodesk a wonderful company and                                 it's all free stuff so we're really                                 trying to keep that the barrier to entry                                 for all of this so that my kids don't                                 just learn powerpoint they're going to                                 learn Tinkercad mesh labs                                                of this stuff is available and readily                                 for free so the other really cool thing                                 is that if you're in Tinkercad                                 everybody's kids and most of us have all                                 played minecraft you can export these                                 scans directly into minecraft now so                                 that's lots of fun and they're so the                                 other thing we have a great sponsor in                                 tinkerin i don't think you've probably                                 heard of them but there they are a group                                 of guys in vancouver who came out of one                                 of them the south of vancouver maker                                 groups and started up a                                             thing and they supplied us with all the                                 printers for our maker labs and they                                 make just like printers before they can                                 make all their money not really off the                                 printers but off of selling you the                                 resin and the PLA in the plastics but                                 that's how we get kids to go all the way                                 through this psycho and we teach them                                 all these things they don't really                                 understand that they're being you know                                 coerced in the learning new software                                 because we've we've gotten them to do it                                 interactively and play with it all                                 now we're starting to expand the                                 curriculum a lot so we got that first                                 one worked out and we do that throughout                                 the school system and now we're taking                                 minnow boards Intel's mineral boards                                 which is sort of like a raspberry pi on                                 steroids android i'm not android arduino                                 and doing all kinds of little robotic                                 workshops too but we really have had a                                 huge success with the                                             because it has given those kids that                                 epiphany moment and so we're always                                 looking for those things that they see                                 themselves in the tech they learn what's                                 the underpinnings of it some of the                                 things they do actually learn coding                                 because they're modding minecraft they                                 see some code in that when they're in                                 tinkerin if they want to write a special                                 script to do bunny ears or something                                 like that they have to go down an alley                                 or down a path and see the script and                                 modify that so without really forcing                                 them they're taking control of the                                 agenda and the whole thing around gaming                                 which was quite interesting to me is I'm                                 not a gamer I the last time I play games                                 was ms pacman long time ago and these                                 kids downloaded Unreal Engine on one of                                 the machines which is now free and they                                 started building playing with it                                 twiddling around with the things and so                                 we ended up having to go and find folks                                 from poly count which is the forum for                                 Unreal Engine and unity and all kinds of                                 other things and they came in they                                 sponsored us and they started giving us                                 web classes on how to do Unreal Engine                                 and and that's where we started playing                                 with all of these wonderful first-person                                 shooter games and we're not experts by                                 any means but I'm really not an expert                                 at all because this is this stuff is one                                 of one of the things with like I would                                 never have come up with shooting gold in                                 the statues as a game in action it's                                 quite loud and it has paint balls and                                 all that but what they're learning is                                 they're they're doing some coding inside                                 of Unreal Engine they're building                                 environments and worlds they're learning                                 all the spatial design stuff that you                                 know if they're going to be draftsman or                                 architects or engineers all of those                                 skills are coming in this in this sort                                 of backdoor way without me having to say                                 ok we're going to sit down and learn                                 drafting today we're going to learn what                                 a spline is today what a curve is those                                 things it all comes in naturally and                                 this sort of stuff is what their yeah                                 it's the fun stuff I love that this                                 isn't a movie theater because it's the                                 first time I've seen it on a huge screen                                 like this it's great and I'll yeah                                 that's somebody's grandmother there yeah                                 oh that's Brian but yeah and this is                                 stuff that you wouldn't think that                                    year olds and                                                          olds could just take off with and do but                                 because we're using these techniques                                 that the teachers are teaching me we are                                 getting to do all kinds of new things                                 and so the next stage that we're doing                                 is really sort of taking apart some of                                 those Internet of Things tools and tasks                                 if you if you want to teach kids about                                 security and privacy you can't say                                 you're teaching kids about security and                                 privacy on the Internet you have to                                 figure out some way to explain to them                                 that these things once you take them                                 apart are watching you constantly and                                 that they play wonderful music but                                 they're also trying to get you to buy                                 stuff on amazon prime this is the Amazon                                 echo which we actually got one of up and                                 to take apart and play with and it's                                 wonderful it does things like plays all                                 the music that they want to hear tells                                 them joked has siri-like capabilities                                 called alexa where you can ask it a                                 question it'll tell you the weather in                                 Berlin I did that just before I did left                                 here and it's really a pretty magical                                 experience however you can just play use                                 it or whoops                                 I lost my pictures okay well I lost the                                 picture somehow and that thing we                                 actually took it apart looked at what                                 was in it under the hood and took a                                 suitcase an old leather suitcase put in                                 a couple of speakers put in a little                                 couple of our dueno boards in it and                                 we're running a bluetooth off of that so                                 that they could walk by with their                                 phones and touch with with their                                 androids do NFC or Bluetooth and put                                 push whatever song they wanted to from                                 their their iphone onto the into the                                 suitcase and we've just added in now the                                 microphone and we're calling the API for                                 the Amazon Alexa API to do the voice                                 recognition so they're actually take it                                 may not be as compact and beautiful but                                 we have a nice little leather suitcase                                 and in that we're rebuilding from                                 scratch completely open source the the                                 IOT device and again that's something                                 that I would not have done but the kids                                 drove us and move the agenda into that                                 space the other thing that there's a lot                                 of other projects out there that we're                                 connecting with the enable the future                                 folks that are doing prosthetic hands                                 there's lots of cool stuff around that                                 that we've been doing so what our goal                                 is is we have the first two of those                                 trailers that we've built out and what                                 we do is we take those we fill them up                                 with all the supplies that we need we                                 teach the teachers how to run the                                 workshops and then we engage get them to                                 engage the cool school or other                                 leadership programs and we'll have time                                 for Q&A so we teach the teachers that                                 and we leave the trailer actually on                                 site I go away because I work I have a                                 day job it's not me teaching the classes                                 so the goal is not really for me to be                                 the one coming and doing a workshop                                 though the first year I did a lot of                                 them the goal is to have that trailer be                                 accessible and be a resource for                                 teachers on on campus at this                                 goals on First Nations reservations on                                 ban land with their school system and                                 take it to Maker Faires and do workshops                                 there but to be able to take that mobile                                 makerspace and leave it behind fully                                 stocked and to do that we we do a lot of                                 tech events like this to raise money and                                 get sponsorship but we're really trying                                 to inspire a movement and right now                                 there's the two that we have up on the                                 coast that were one that's in action and                                 one that's being built out and there are                                 three of them in Vancouver and so I had                                 this vision when I started this whole                                 thing you know what a food truck is of                                 having food truck rallies but having                                 maker truck rallies so that we all bring                                 all of our different technologies around                                 and have a circle the wagon moment with                                 all different tech so what my goal is is                                 really not to make you have to come or                                 to your kids have to come to a                                 makerspace or just have a one day make                                 one off maker faire moment but to be                                 actually be able to bring these circuses                                 to the schools to underserved                                 communities across Canada and in where                                 we go and we go all the way down to                                 portland oregon and washington and                                 seattle washington so we go through the                                 whole Pacific Northwest my goal is                                 really to start to inspire an entire                                 movement of mobile maker spaces to take                                 and be as resources for teachers and the                                 next generation to get that epiphany                                 moment going and of course we do a lot                                 of automating of all the workflows and                                 if you want to talk to me later about                                 Cooper Nettie's or docker or any of that                                 fun stuff I'm quite happy to do that but                                 really what it is all about it's all                                 about the kids we have to thank our                                 sponsors because we have lots of them                                 there should be one more logo up there                                 Microsoft donated a whole whack of Xbox                                 connects to us recently so we're very                                 grateful for that and with that I'd say                                 thank you very much for listening to me                                 and our story and hopefully someday                                 you'll be inspired to create a mobile                                 makerspace or to work within the school                                 systems and bring some of these new                                 epiphanies to kids elsewhere this is how                                 you could reach me this is how you can                                 tweet us                                 if you're interested in learning more                                 and be happy to talk to you all and I'll                                 take some questions if people have them                                 thank you do I have we have                                            for questions so I'm not quite sure okay                                 now i have a sound so please raise your                                 hands if you have any questions okay                                 it's early morning it's                                                 so I really want to thank you all very                                 much I can't see anybody's hands up                                 because it's we have one question one                                 question way up here all right great so                                 it I probably all told spent about um I                                 would say if I'm really honest about                                 seven or eight grand of my own money                                 that got put into it probably if I'm                                 totally honest a little bit more I'm                                 very good at coercing people into doing                                 things so the coast makers are there's                                 electricians cabinet makers if you work                                 with your local makers group if you went                                 to fab lab or said you could find the                                 people to help you build it out there's                                 um I'm also pretty good at coercing                                 sponsors into donating things like                                 printers if I had to pay for everything                                 that I did if we probably be around                                    grand but it wasn't I mean it really is                                 a collaborative effort and I think                                 that's the thing and once you get into                                 the school systems then it makes it even                                 easier um there's another question here                                 and the microphone is actually right                                 behind you that's quite easy I was                                 wondering this seems like a really                                 bottom-up approach so you try to reach                                 the kids using your Caravan like we say                                 here in Europe I was wondering did you                                 try to try a more top-down reach into                                 the education system and try to                                 establish something there it's it's a                                 very good question so                                 we on the coast where we are I started                                 go I I did this I did an earlier                                 iteration of this which was called                                 discover totems because there are so                                 many First Nations folks I was trying to                                 teach tech that way and so I would go                                 and I would be the one person that would                                 go and deliver a course and get approved                                 by the teachers and the curriculum to                                 teach this one course and it just didn't                                 scale so what we don't scale I'm not                                 multi-tenant and I on camp you can't put                                 me in a container so so we did and and                                 but I wasn't leaving behind enough                                 skills so the the next the next                                 iteration of that I decided to get out                                 step outside of it and not make it about                                 me and work with a whole bunch of                                 collaborators and in those collaborators                                 are the principles from some of the cool                                 the school systems on the sunshine coast                                 and the first year was really about                                 developing a curriculum that people                                 would have epiphany moments and trying                                 to figure out what that is and get                                 sponsors and build the whole thing up                                 and almost immediately as soon as we had                                 something real like it wasn't just talk                                 the school systems just invited us in                                 and so now we are working in                                 collaboration with the local school                                 systems for BC and hopefully spreading                                 it all across British Columbia and                                 Canada but this this model scales                                 because it's not about individual people                                 doing it you can build out a trailer you                                 can train teachers you can train you                                 know the older students to teach the                                 courses and that's really the difference                                 I think then just coming in and doing                                 yeah look at me i have on my cool tech                                 for one day that's not replacing the                                 powerpoint issue so thank you any other                                 question yeah please come to the                                 microphone                                 there's a very bright spotlights okay so                                 you're working on this full time no I am                                 NOT i'm working for red hat full-time                                 this is something because i have                                 collaborators there's one other person                                 on the coast who's a full-time person                                 working on it at the moment there are                                 about six kids that are trained now that                                 can do the stuff on the inside of the                                 trailer and we're working over the                                 summer with the teachers so there there                                 is no full-time employee this is all                                 that group of coast makers that you saw                                 that kind of ragtag band of folks those                                 are the people that are keeping the                                 trail building the trailers and keeping                                 them up it's a big collaboration                                 otherwise you get them and you get the                                 kids to do it themselves that's what you                                 do you recruit the kids you recruit the                                 kids and it's really easy to do you know                                 once you get it in there if you figure                                 out the right sort of thing to do you                                 know you're not like teak saying you                                 will learn Unreal Engine you know you                                 will do well I'm going to have to learn                                 now next on the occultists rift the VR                                 stuff because that's the next thing they                                 decided they wanted to learn so the next                                 trailer is a VR trailer and all of that                                 stuff is coming in July so the person                                 who only knows pac-man is going to do VR                                 this summer and so I get a lot out of it                                 too so I learn all this new tech but                                 it's it's by no means a full-time job                                 how does the gender balance ago as the                                 kids go over as at you have to make a                                 concerted effort to get the girls                                 involved the gender balance in the                                 younger ages just doing the                                            it                                                                   trying to get them in the leadership                                 roles is you have takes takes in it                                 takes effort and takes attention so my                                 goal the first year the first Maker                                 Faires that we did I ran the workshops                                 this past one the entire trailer was set                                 up and run by                                                           goal next year is that the whole thing                                 is run by girls                                 so it's it definitely takes a concerted                                 effort we have time for a very short                                 question so yeah please come to the                                 microphone                                 hi I want to do you know coderdojo from                                 Ireland the movement yeah I've seen yeah                                 maybe it could combine somehow I don't                                 know yes so we do so we have on the                                 coast like I said we sort of the                                 fastest-growing maker community in all                                 of Canada it's happening right now and                                 we have folks that do scratch and all                                 sorts of other teaching coding stuff so                                 what I've focused on is what I knew you                                 know the                                                                 but we have other curriculums that are                                 coming in to teach teach that and it is                                 we learn from all the other the dojo                                 from PI ladies from girls that code all                                 kinds of great organizations out there                                 that enable the futures is another one                                 that you know we had                                                     a relationship with them I met them all                                 at Red Hat some it's an amazing network                                 of people out there doing this kind of                                 stuff the key is to figure out a model                                 that's repeatable and scalable that you                                 can keep bringing back because there's a                                 lot of burnout in this kind of stuff so                                 when you create this there's a sort of                                 an arc for maker spaces they'll get                                 total enthusiasm donations find the                                 space build a space and for the first                                 two or three years they'll have great                                 you know great number of people                                 participating using the space using and                                  as the volunteer board gets tired of                                  being the volunteer board they kind of                                  arc and Wayne so we've seen a bit of                                  that so it's we're trying really hard to                                  scale the model get incorporated into                                  the school systems and work work in                                  tandem so this I think that's the end of                                  my time I really want to thank you for                                  having me come to Berlin I get a chance                                  to see some of the maker spaces here and                                  to meet all of you and I'll be around                                  afterwards drinking more coffee because                                  it is                                                                   you can ask any more questions so thank                                  you very much                                  you
