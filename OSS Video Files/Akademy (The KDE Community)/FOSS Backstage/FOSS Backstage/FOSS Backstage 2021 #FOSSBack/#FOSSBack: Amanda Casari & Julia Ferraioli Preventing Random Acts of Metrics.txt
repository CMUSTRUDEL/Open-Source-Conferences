Title: #FOSSBack: Amanda Casari & Julia Ferraioli Preventing Random Acts of Metrics
Publication date: 2021-03-01
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	We know that open source is greater than the source code, that people of all skills contribute to the larger ecosystem that is open source software and the communities we grow to invest in people. How do we see this world, quantitatively and qualitatively? Which metrics should we be using and which should we definitely not rely on? We'll review what we have learned in Google's Open Source Programs Office about open source data, metrics, and tracking change in open source ecosystems.

	                              good morning i                               um morning for us hello to everybody for                               your afternoon                               i'm amanda casari and i'm a white woman                               with curlish blonde hair                               i'm wearing a blue sweater with a red                               scarf and this is julie farioli who is a                               white woman with curly brown hair and is                               wearing a flannel shirt                                together we co-lead the google side of                                project ocean where we study open source                                as ecosystems and complex networks which                                is why we call ourselves                                open source scientists and                                archaeologists and we're here today to                                talk to you about what you should                                consider and what you should avoid when                                you think about metrics for systems like                                open source                                if you prefer you can find our slides                                and speaker notes at this url                                it's bitl dot ly                                slash f o s s dash backstage                                dash p r a m                                and so what exactly is open source and                                there is a standard definition which we                                use and talk about it's maintained by                                the open source initiative the                                definition focuses                                mostly on how software is hardware and                                distributed and licensed                                as well as what you can and cannot do                                with software and still call it open                                source                                and we bring this up because when we                                talk about open source                                we talk about more than licensing and                                distribution rules                                open source has evolved to represent a                                framework that shapes how software is                                created released                                shared distributed as well as the                                communities themselves                                and how they form around the projects                                and because we know that open source is                                not just technical projects but a                                combination                                of systems of technical and social                                components                                it's actually a socio-technical system                                and so let's break down what that means                                a bit when we examine a socio-technical                                system we have to consider                                the technical components and                                infrastructure like code bases                                packing packaging indices and metadata                                from the mailing lists                                we have to look at the social components                                which are the people the communities as                                well as the social contracts that they                                agree on together                                and the interactions between these                                different systems                                the socio-technical element is why                                measuring open source                                is so difficult we have this gut                                instinct that open source is critical to                                modern business                                but we don't have an agreed upon way of                                measuring it                                it's not that people haven't tried um                                but a major problem is around                                data and metrics nadia eggball outlined                                this problem in her rhodes and bridges                                report                                she says that usage metrics are either                                highly inaccurate                                or simply unavailable this is not an                                easy problem to solve for                                and the impact of digital infrastructure                                is still very difficult to measure but                                without data                                about which tools are used and how much                                we rely upon them                                it is hard to paint a clear picture of                                what is underfunded                                she continues to postulate that with                                better metrics we could describe                                the economic impact of digital                                infrastructure                                identify critical projects that are                                lacking support                                and understand dependencies between                                projects                                and people                                so let's talk about how to define better                                more                                meaningful metrics in the context of                                open source                                 better metrics focus on useful metrics                                 this fairly straightforward approach can                                 help guide you through the creation of                                 metrics                                 first need to identify your objectives                                 then we define their observable aspects                                 establish baselines define the trends                                 that we want to see                                 and determine our signal phenomena let's                                 walk through this step by step                                 it's tempting to determine what you can                                 measure first when thinking about                                 metrics                                 this that approach can lead to an                                 abundance of data collected                                 but it can also lead to misleading                                 metrics                                 instead first you need to identify your                                 objectives                                 you need to understand what you want you                                 need to know what you care about                                 if you can't answer both of those it's                                 time to brainstorm again                                 and remember these aren't set in stone                                 as your product and its associated                                 community change                                 you can always change them or formulate                                 new ones                                 next it's time to define aspects of each                                 objective that can be observed                                 you need to understand how what you want                                 actually works                                 another way to think about an aspect is                                 the trait                                 choosing aspects of your metrics is the                                 most important step                                 to remember that you should that what                                 you should measure                                 is not the same as asking what you can                                 measure                                 it allows you to reach beyond the easily                                 obtainable data                                 into information that truly tells the                                 picture of your objective                                 sometimes what you're interested in                                 doesn't match up to the data that you                                 can actually collect                                 in these cases we can use proxy                                 variables                                 which can circumscribe what you're                                 actually trying to measure                                 now we can establish a baseline for each                                 aspect                                 you can't measure progress or regression                                 without understanding where you are                                 currently if you don't know where you                                 are now                                 you can make an informed estimate in a                                 few ways                                 one is to one way is to examine other                                 projects                                 to see where they are as an analytical                                 starting point                                 then measure for a short period of time                                 before you reestablish                                 your baseline                                 step four is defining your                                 desired trend                                 you need to know where you want to go do                                 you want more of something                                 okay that's increasing you want                                 something to reduce                                 that's a decreasing trend and uh                                 the often ignored steady straight steady                                 state trend                                 is when we want things to stay the same                                 lastly we have determining our signal                                 phenomena                                 signal phenomena determine when a change                                 in a phenomenon will appear                                 in an observation this is so important                                 because you need to know what changes to                                 expect                                 over time and when they will impact you                                 does your aspect capture events before                                 the impact shows another metrics                                 that's a leading signal does it                                 show it after that's a lagging                                 lagging signal this may seem                                 pretty straightforward these these five                                 steps                                 but that's the point the point is to                                 be able to move from what you should                                 measure to talking about                                 are these metrics useful in evaluating                                 our progress                                 towards our goal                                 the system can fall short if it fails to                                 consider the boundaries of the systemat                                 models                                 if we limit ourselves to the project we                                 are ignoring the impact of                                 and on the community we need to reset                                 the boundaries around our metrics to                                 include both the projects                                 and their communities                                 and so let's go back to the foundation                                 that open source is a socio-technical                                 system                                 and this means we cannot focus on                                 assumptions and goals directly tied to                                 the systems alone                                 we have to expand our abstraction level                                 beyond what's called the algorithmic                                 framing                                 and so here when we're talking about                                 algorithmic framing we'll be using the                                 definition from selps                                 at all's                                                         abstraction in sociotechnical systems                                 so they define algorithmic framing as                                 choosing representations                                 which is data and labeling outcomes                                 and in machine learning these choices                                 are then used to compare the outputs to                                 the inputs                                 and since this is standard for most data                                 analysis that we're looking at                                 where evaluative methods are chosen                                 based on some kind of inputs                                 and compared to some kind of previous                                 outputs we can apply a similar                                 methodology to open source metrics in                                 analysis                                 and the problem with this framing when                                 examining socio-technical systems is                                 that it creates too narrow of a view                                 and i quote where the abstraction is                                 taken as a given                                 and is rarely if ever interrogated for                                 validity                                 despite the fact that many of these                                 choices are made due to accidents of                                 opportunity                                 and access to data end quote and so does                                 this sound familiar                                 that we would measure and create models                                 based on the data available to us                                 not necessarily based on the systems we                                 want to be observing                                 i think we see that quite a bit when we                                 talk with open source projects                                 and people who are trying to understand                                 what is happening in open source                                 based on the data that they can find not                                 necessarily the data that tells them the                                 full picture                                 and as a selbs at all assert the                                 contrast to the                                 algorithmic frame is the sociotechnical                                 frame and this explicitly recognizes                                 that models and analyses are part of the                                 sociotechnical system                                 and that other components of these                                 systems also need to be modeled                                 and we can get there by first knowing                                 what kinds of problems these limited                                 abstractions create                                 and that's what this work defines as                                 abstraction traps and how to mitigate                                 them                                 and so we're going to introduce those                                 now and we'll walk you through those                                 where you might see them in the process                                 of creating metrics for                                 open source and so first                                 we have what's called the framing drop                                 and this is when we fail to model                                 an entire system over which a social                                 criterion such as fairness in the case                                 of the paper                                 will be enforced second we have what's                                 called the portability trap                                 and this is when we fail to understand                                 how repurposing algorithmic solutions                                 designed for one social context                                 may be misleading inaccurate or                                 otherwise do harm when applied to                                 a different context                                 third is the formalism trap this is the                                 failure to account                                 for the full meaning of social concepts                                 which can be procedural                                 contextual and contestable and cannot be                                 resolved through mathematical formalisms                                 next is the ripple effect trap and                                 that's when you fail to understand how                                 insertion of a technology                                 into an existing social system changes                                 the behaviors                                 and embedded values of a pre-existing                                 system                                 and lastly present the solution                                 solutionism trap                                 and this is when we fail to recognize                                 that the possibility                                 that the best solution may not involve                                 technology at all                                 and so to tie the concepts of creating                                 useful metrics and abstraction tracks                                 together                                 julie and i would like to walk you                                 through an example                                 so we have created a fictitious but                                 beautifully illustrated uh comprehensive                                 data science library written entirely in                                 go                                 um called go numb we do want to indicate                                 this is not actually real                                 but we'd like to talk to you if                                 anybody's interested in creating this                                 and we're eager to get feedback on our                                 brand new data science library                                 and grow the user base but because we're                                 scientists we like to share our work and                                 we want other people to use things we've                                 created                                 before our launch our lab before we                                 launch our library                                 uh we're going to process a go through a                                 process to help us figure out where                                 our work is where we're not we're moving                                 in the right direction and here's how we                                 might go about it                                 okay going back to the the process we                                 outlined earlier                                 remember our first step is to identify                                 the objectives                                 so we've identified three possible ones                                 the first is is our target user adopting                                 it                                 is it easy to set up by themselves                                 i feel like with a lot of data science                                 libraries                                 people kind of get stuck on the                                 installation process i blame fortran                                 honestly um and and finally                                 does the library meet our target users                                 needs                                 all of these objectives are worth                                 pursuing                                 but for the purpose of this example                                 let's focus                                 on one the library is easy to install                                 so if you're not familiar with with go                                 the setup process is actually                                 you know pretty straightforward we can                                 go                                 to goes package registry                                 from there there's a search we can                                 search for data science libraries                                 and hopefully we'll locate our very our                                 new package go num                                 from there we can read the documentation                                 decide                                 if we want to actually install this                                 library if it's right for us                                 and then we run a command of go get                                 go num which is how we install the                                 package                                 and finally we build our first                                 application against it                                 um and hopefully nothing goes wrong                                 and so we're going to pause here for a                                 moment because this is actually a place                                 where                                 even julia and i almost fell into the                                 formalism trap                                 there's a great opportunity when you're                                 defining objectives                                 um to do this because the formalism trap                                 in this case would be that we could fail                                 to account for fully                                 fail to fully account for the full                                 meaning of social concepts which cannot                                 be resolved into mathematical formalism                                 um and in this one we were making the                                 assumption that we can just record the                                 steps we take to install the library to                                 know what to measure                                 um the where place where julian i ran                                 into this even is uh is                                 her familiarity with go is so much                                 stronger than mine                                 and my familiar with data science                                 libraries and other languages has                                 experience in some more context                                 uh than she does but as we're talking                                 going through the process of                                 what does installation a setup look like                                 um we both entered in at completely                                 different places and so even though we                                 are both doing with the knowledge that                                 we have to outline the process from our                                 point of view                                 we even can't fully account for all the                                 concepts that impact or aren't observed                                 in an installation                                 those social concepts like experience                                 which you can't represent or explain                                 through mathematical formalisms                                 in addition to that there's another                                 place that we identified in the make a                                 decision step                                 that's probably potentially procedural                                 contextual                                 that may prevent people from adopting a                                 library like this and one of those might                                 be                                 an open source license that's attached                                 to this library may not comply with the                                 user's corporate open source policies                                 and we have no way of capturing that                                 kind of data in this metrics pipeline                                 to tell us whether or not our library                                 and our adoption                                 is successful just based on the aspects                                 that we've identified as well as the                                 objectives that we're naming                                 so maybe the the whole process of                                 installation is a little bit too                                 too broad so let's narrow down on                                 one specific aspect that we can really                                 sink our teeth into                                 the actual process of pulling the                                 library                                 onto a user's computer and ensuring they                                 can build against it                                 so what can we measure about the                                 installation                                 itself um the two                                 things that we thought about                                 was the successful installation                                 can you install it can you literally                                 pull it onto your computer                                 and can you build against it but                                 these things can't necessarily be                                 be properly captured so                                 the the question is for a successful                                 installation                                 can we figure out some proxies to use                                 such as                                 issues filed questions um etc                                 because privacy dictates that we can't                                 actively measure successful                                 installations                                 we don't want the library to call home                                 right that's not                                 not cool um so what are some                                 assumptions that we have around                                 actual installation                                 well if we untease it it's                                 actually quite complex there are some                                 things that we don't often think about                                 does the person have access to source                                 control                                 that's a that's a good question does the                                 user have go installed                                 or is that actually an extra step that                                 they'll need to                                 complete before they can use our library                                 do they have a compatible system                                 especially with data science like you're                                 going to need some                                 you're going to need some memory right                                 so                                 um there's the open question of whether                                 they've they've got the technical                                 requirements to actually run the library                                 and finally data science libraries tend                                 to have                                 quite a few dependencies                                 so the final question that or the final                                 assumption that we have is                                 does the person have sufficient                                 bandwidth to actually                                 install the library plus its                                 dependencies                                 these are all potential proxies um                                 around the all right                                 apologies i got mixed up so                                 these are all assumptions that we have                                 to take into account                                 when thinking about successful                                 installations                                 yeah and this is another place that we                                 want to start examining where it's                                 potentially possible                                 to fall into one of these abstraction                                 traps and so                                 here if we're looking at download data                                 or trying to understand what download                                 data tells us about our user base                                 you can very easily fall into the                                 framing trap by                                 by failing to fully account for all the                                 users who could be working with our                                 technical system                                 as julia pointed out there's a lot of                                 assumptions that we just made or that we                                 would be making                                 about somebody who is able to have                                 access to these kinds of libraries                                 to these kinds of pipelines to the                                 source control                                 um as to their connectivity issues                                 and all of those things because we care                                 about making our work as universal as                                 possible                                 then those are things that we can think                                 about look at the assumptions for and                                 mitigate and we can do this by                                 adopting what's called a heterogeneous                                 engineering approach                                 and that simultaneously considers the                                 technical components as well as the                                 humans who work and live alongside them                                 and so for here for example when we are                                 looking at like metadata from successful                                 downloads for something such as                                 geographic region                                 we have to still recognize as a part of                                 our analysis on our metrics that this                                 only shows                                 part of the picture so we can't say from                                 this kind of data                                 well we're really doing well in this                                 country                                 from that metric but it does allow you                                 to ask better questions like                                 what drove downloads in this area why                                 were these users                                 able to successfully download here and                                 something like                                 what are other blockers to a successful                                 download that might exist for other                                 users                                 in this area and so by moving from this                                 algorithmic frame to the data frame that                                 you're looking at outputs and inputs to                                 the humans that move alongside of it in                                 the sociotechnical frame                                 you can ask better and different                                 questions                                 and we really want to emphasize this                                 point especially as you're looking at                                 metrics that these are always                                 a starting off point for you to ask more                                 and better questions                                 like this especially about the people                                 you care about which is                                 not only who is using your information                                 or who's using your project but who                                 could be using                                 your project                                 okay um now that we                                 uh we've identified our                                 um our potential metrics we can move                                 ahead                                 with establishing baselines again you                                 need to know                                 where you are now                                 but this is a new library so we                                 really aren't anywhere currently                                 remember that we can make an informed                                 estimate to try and back into a baseline                                 we could take an inventory of other                                 libraries and look at their metrics                                 and start measuring our library's                                 performance with respect to them                                 and so here's where it's very easy to                                 fall into the portability trap                                 when you're trying to estimate where you                                 are and where you want to be                                 especially because you're looking for                                 other analogs or other comparisons that                                 you could make against                                 the thing that you're working on                                 programming in computer science in                                 general hoards                                 portability to be a highly valuable                                 trait and the problem with this can be                                 when you're not able to accurately                                 assess when solutions                                 that to questions from one context would                                 lead                                 you in the wrong direction and so in                                 this case                                 if we are comparing our library to other                                 types of go libraries                                 we could get misleading or inaccurate                                 inaccurate baselines or estimates for a                                 data science specific go library                                 data science like julia said has                                 dependencies many dependencies in a                                 project                                 such as access to other data                                 and scientific computing libraries as                                 well as access to data                                 to begin with which is not necessarily a                                 prerequisite for                                 other go libraries as people are looking                                 to figure out what to do with computing                                 with go                                 go is also not currently currently high                                 on the list of preferred languages for                                 data scientists or data analysts                                 so people who might want to be using                                 this kind of package                                 may not be present in ecosystem you're                                 looking with and so here you would want                                 to focus on assumptions for your                                 specific application you want to look at                                 your domain                                 you want to look at the programming                                 language you want to look at who is                                 present to your community as well as                                 their community needs where you might be                                 meeting a gap that didn't exist before                                 and so if you can't find a good analog                                 with where you are                                 you can start at the very beginning                                 which is a very good place to start                                 at zero                                 okay we've uh we've avoided the                                 portability trap and established our                                 baselines                                 next step is how we want to see our                                 measurements progress                                 how they trend again we can't measure                                 the successful installations directly                                 but some things we can measure are                                 number of downloads maybe increasing                                 with the number of issues decreasing                                 if we can see the number of installation                                 issues decreasing                                 we can safely interpret or can we safely                                 interpret                                 that to mean that the number of users                                 who experience difficulties have gone                                 down                                 and coupling that with the increased                                 numbers of people downloading the                                 library                                 that seems to be a clear indication of                                 an easy installation process                                 right amanda well this is also where you                                 want to make sure that you're taking                                 caution                                 and so you have the opportunity here                                 to fall into the solutionism trap we've                                 done a good job so far of reminding                                 ourselves of the human component and the                                 social context surrounding our new data                                 science library                                 by analyzing our trend data it's really                                 easy to fall into this kind of trap                                 if we assume that our metrics process                                 and the approximations that we are                                 making                                 are telling us the story we need to hear                                 and the full picture of what's happening                                 but dashboards and metrics are only                                 indicators of project health and they                                 may not contain                                 all of the nuance and the unmeasurable                                 attributes you need to understand to                                 make full project decisions                                 uh human preferences are not rational                                 and human psychology is not conclusively                                 measurable                                 so you cannot fully quantify your                                 community or your                                 users through these automated pipelines                                 so you have to focus really here and                                 understand that remember that when                                 you're looking at your project health                                 when you're looking at your community                                 health because that's part of your                                 project and what you're working on                                 that you have to continue to build                                 communities and not audiences                                 and the difference here really is that                                 connection piece so who gets to have                                 voice who gets to have attention and who                                 gets to make decisions                                 and how those are listened to so turning                                 those unidirectional arrows into                                 bi-directional arrows                                 and so ask people open-ended questions                                 that don't fit cleanly in a one-to-five                                 scale on a user survey                                 and learn from their experiences and                                 what shapes them to help really                                 understand                                 how you are doing how your project's                                 doing and where you want the direction                                 of things to go                                 the final step in our metrics journey is                                 to determine our signal phenomena                                 for installing the library an increase                                 in platform support requests could                                 indicate an increase                                 in the number of types of users that                                 would be a good example of a leading                                 signal                                 or a leading indicator                                 an increase in submitted patches to the                                 installation documentation                                 could indicate that users are already                                 frustrated                                 and need instructions that are more                                 clear that would be a lagging signal                                 so with all these uh steps and traps                                 to avoid remember that the metrics you                                 choose are a reflection of what matters                                 to you                                 your project and your community take the                                 time to be thoughtful                                 to dive deeper into what matters to be                                 measured                                 and to avoid the abstraction traps                                 if your goal is not to just release work                                 but to foster and nurture the ecosystem                                 that we all rely upon i think we can                                 agree                                 that the extra work is necessary for the                                 common good                                 we're in this raft together                                 so here are some resources and                                 references                                 that that we mentioned in in the talk                                 today                                 uh the first two are the roads and                                 bridges                                 and the paper with the abstraction traps                                 and finally we have some a couple of                                 links to                                 the ocean project open source complex                                 ecosystems and networks                                 with both our github repository as well                                 as                                 opportunities for research awards                                 thank you thank you                                 hi great thank you um amanda and julia                                 so much                                 for that talk it was um really good um                                 so i want to say to the audience um if                                 you have any questions                                 um drop them in the chat or the                                 questions bar we have                                 um a couple of minutes um for questions                                 so                                 don't be shy um put those in                                 i wanted to while we wait for anyone's                                 questions i i wanted to ask something um                                 the there's a quote in there build                                 communities not audiences                                 um which i think is uh really stood out                                 to me                                 do you have any examples um                                 that have impressed you where that has                                 taken place so that we can get an idea                                 of what that looks like                                 i mean i think there are there are so                                 many different examples                                 um in i feel like                                 you know some of the the more popular                                 examples are um like kubernetes                                 which i feel like has done a very good                                 job at bringing the community along with                                 them                                 um and they've been very intentional                                 about that um amanda do you have a                                 shining example in mind um i actually                                 think some of the                                 like the looking at the history of how                                 um core maintainers have changed in                                 python over time                                 i think is an excellent example of this                                 so the way that the                                 language community has changed from                                 um invitation only style                                 core maintainers groups into mentorship                                 and to bringing people with them and to                                 seeking and looking for                                 new maintainers through a growth network                                 that to me speaks more to looking                                 looking for feedback onto how a group is                                 moving and moving a project from                                 a central um individual person and                                 figurehead into more of a                                 like a committee style project for                                 something that is so large both of those                                 i think are kind of good signals that                                 people are looking to really create                                 feedback loops as opposed to being one                                 direction with projects                                 okay great um i have a couple of                                 questions from the audience                                 and the first one is um what component                                 to start with                                 when developing community health metrics                                 for                                 long-term assessments so how often                                 should they be revised                                 so i would encourage for any kind of                                 frequency question around metrics really                                 needs to take into consideration                                 in consideration how often things are                                 changing so if things are changing very                                 quickly in your community or if there is                                 some kind of global crisis happening                                 that is impacting                                 many different groups of people at the                                 same time or even local crisis that's                                 happening in a group of your core users                                 you should definitely increase frequency                                 in terms of making sure that you are                                 monitoring and understanding what is                                 happening with a group of people                                 because things are changing more rapidly                                 to impact them                                 and so you want to keep an eye on that                                 the other thing i would say would be is                                 if you see                                 any um any increases in any of your                                 signals so julia laid out well                                 when you're looking for increasing                                 decreasing steady state lagging and                                 leading                                 if you see any of those also changing                                 very quickly                                 or then i would say really decrease your                                 sampling window                                 so that way you understand better when                                 things are changing                                 that you need to meet those needs that                                 you need to meet julia would you add                                 something yeah sorry                                 yeah i i would just add you know i i                                 i know the the temptation to try to get                                 like a                                 one de facto answer um                                 but the the unfortunate reality is that                                 there is no                                 uh one one answer to to that question it                                 really depends                                 on um on the contexts involved                                 so yeah unfortunately                                 okay um okay so i have another question                                 um                                 in your experience what is the                                 maintainer reaction when you propose                                 gathering or drawing                                 on qualitative data                                 yeah that's a good question i think                                 qualitative data                                 has to be handled very carefully                                 quantitative data does as well but                                 qualitative needs even more care in                                 terms of                                 privacy and sometimes anonymity                                 our suggestions by the way are for                                 any open source project who has a desire                                 to move in this direction                                 there's no obligation right so if your                                 project                                 is your if your full desire is a creator                                 is to make something                                 put it into the world and anybody who                                 wants to or can use it can pick it up                                 but uh but that's it like that's the                                 extent of your creation                                 that's absolutely fine right so um                                 there's no obligation                                 for um for maintainers or creators uh                                 necessarily to follow up with pieces of                                 their work                                 it's just a matter of whether or not you                                 want that to be part of the component of                                 what you're working with                                 um and so i think about it in terms of                                 different                                 there are definitely different kinds of                                 projects                                 yeah and unfortunately it seems                                 as though the the ability                                 um in terms of time money etc                                 expertise to really gather                                 qualitative data is is sort of limited                                 to the larger product projects                                 um so a number of them run surveys uh                                 yearly surveys twice a year surveys et                                 cetera                                 to really gather some of that that                                 information but it's                                 it's um it's not a capability that's                                 available to                                 to every project and we we definitely                                 recognize that                                 i i'll add in there that i also think                                 that is an excellent opportunity to                                 include more                                 people in open source projects so there                                 are amazing designers                                 and researchers and program managers and                                 community managers                                 who would like to be part of more pieces                                 of open source                                 but may not necessarily want to be                                 working on code bases or triaging or                                 issue tracking                                 and so if this is a role or an area that                                 you're interested in for your project                                 there are people who want to be doing                                 that with you and contributing as                                 in that way and so if you are interested                                 in doing this but you don't want to do                                 it yourself you can find                                 partners and friends and teammates to do                                 this with you                                 okay great um we've gone a bit over but                                 we have two more questions so we'll try                                 and squeeze                                 those in um the first one is about um                                 referencing an earlier talk it says um                                 nadi revealed                                 the problem of underfunded maintainers                                 have you done any                                 any research on sustainability and                                 well-being of foss authors                                 that's a great question um i                                 we uh actually had a bit of a book club                                 reading her                                 her uh working in public book uh                                 recently                                 um so in terms of underfunded                                 maintainers                                 i feel as though we we've done                                 a bit of research                                 um but nothing super                                 definitive i feel like                                 amanda you might have done a bit more                                 work in that in that area                                 yeah i'll say that um we do have some                                 open research questions that we're                                 investigating                                 around uh economies in open source                                 yeah so if you're interested in that you                                 should apply for one of those research                                 awards                                 yeah if you have an and we'll say to the                                 the research awards which we'll bring                                 back up                                 because this is really important um                                 those research awards are not limited to                                 academic research                                 so they are open for communities they're                                 open for independent researchers                                 we'd like to really encourage global                                 research reach                                 around researchers from all over the                                 world as well as the communities that                                 you're interested in taking a look at so                                 please consider applying okay great                                 um would you be able to um                                 i don't know maybe drop those links in                                 the chat afterwards so people can click                                 on them                                 or sure okay and um we have one last                                 question                                 um so do you have any thoughts or                                 comments about the work being done                                 under the um chaos community so the                                 community health                                 analytics community and the tools that                                 are available there                                 yeah one of our colleagues uh is                                 actually one of the contributors in                                 chaos as well and i think i've dropped a                                 comment or two                                 um when i've been able to going into the                                 repo i think that's a great group of                                 people who are working on some really                                 interesting projects um i i like their                                 approach i like their community                                 collaborative approach                                 um excited to work on more and help give                                 feedback as well as                                  any time as well uh it's a complex area                                  so there's                                  uh there's plenty of room yes                                  you
