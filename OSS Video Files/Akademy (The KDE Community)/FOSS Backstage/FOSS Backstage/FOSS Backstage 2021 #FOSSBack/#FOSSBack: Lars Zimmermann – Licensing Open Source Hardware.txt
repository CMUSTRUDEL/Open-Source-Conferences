Title: #FOSSBack: Lars Zimmermann – Licensing Open Source Hardware
Publication date: 2021-02-25
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Link to the public slides of this talk: https://opencircularity.info/osh-licenses/

While the situation around licensing in software is always worth a debate and not quite as settled as it could be the situation for hardware is much worse. There are a lot of misconceptions out there about how to license hardware designs. This talk will show you some of the common misunderstandings, highlight the open questions, propose some collective action to fix the situation and yes - of course - also explain how things are done the right way. 

The talk will be a summary and extended version of the public FAQ "Why are Creative Commons Non Commercial licenses not Open Source and a big problem in hardware and product design".

	                              okay                               uh i don't have a slideshow my slides                               are a public website so                               uh i encourage all of you to go to this                               website here and uh                               read while i'm talking and click maybe                               jump ahead if you're bored                               i said i'm a designer artist and                               activist and i have a couple of                                disclaimers                                this is a talk about legal issues but                                i'm                                not a lawyer so this is no legal advice                                but i gave my best to really figure                                out how this is right then uh disclaimer                                two different countries have different                                laws                                uh but what i am going to explain here                                should match                                the legal situation here in germany and                                europe and probably                                a lot of parts of the world too then                                disclaimer three this is just a fraction                                of                                the complex problem of licensing open                                hardware                                of course i need i had to pick uh                                something to focus on here                                okay let's start um and i start with                                statement and that is                                licensing open source hardware is really                                messy and it's broken at least compared                                uh to software from my point of views                                the world of software looks just amazing                                early organized and the reason for this                                is that                                software is governed by copyright law                                as probably all you know                                like works of art and images and this                                makes everything somehow very simple                                because                                copyright is something you receive                                automatically the moment you create                                something                                and this means that software is born                                closed                                uh but this makes the situation very                                clear from the beginning                                you know if you see a piece of software                                it's closed                                you have to find someone who owns it and                                this someone needs to become                                active to open it and there's a simple                                standard way just pick one of the many                                existing ready-to-use open source                                licenses or maybe a creative commons                                license                                because all of these licenses are                                copyright based                                and then they make a statement or what                                you allow others to do with your work                                under the conditions uh you want them to                                fulfill                                but here is uh where we entered the                                realm of hardware we entered a realm of                                functionalities                                and where functionalities start                                copyright                                automatically ends so copyright                                explicitly                                does not apply to anything that has to                                do with functionalities                                and this of course also means that                                copyright based licenses                                don't apply to hardware and the simple                                story here is imagine you write a book                                about a time machine then the book                                the novel is protected by copyright law                                but the machine you describe                                in the book is not everyone can build it                                unless you have a patent or design                                rights registered of course                                we still need copyright based licenses                                for the uh in                                an open source hardware but only for the                                documentation so                                so the source uh for example the                                description or images how to's and so on                                but it really needs to be clear that                                these                                licenses usually creative commons                                licenses i don't say anything about the                                hardware itself                                just about the design files                                so the thing with patents                                is that they are really fundamentally                                different from copyright                                the key difference is that all hardware                                is born free you don't receive a patent                                 automatically you have to become active                                 to get it                                 and to close the hardware and this comes                                 first with costs while copyright was for                                 free                                 and you can only patent ideas that are                                 new                                 so you can't paint in anything that is                                 already known to the public this is                                 already prior art                                 while you can remix classic ideas uh in                                 software or                                 in novels and so on so this is really                                 important to understand                                 hardware is born free                                 so the question is then how to tackle                                 the legal side of it                                 and the answer is very easy just do                                 nothing except publish your work very                                 prominently                                 for example on the web with this it                                 becomes prior art                                 it goes into the comments and no one                                 including yourself can close it                                 anymore forever um                                 but this of course also means that you                                 then can't tell others what they can do                                 with your                                 work you have no way to govern what they                                 do                                 how they use it and what they give back                                 for example                                 theoretically yes you could                                 if you have an invention that is new you                                 could file a patent then you get                                 exclusive rights                                 and then you could create a public                                 license that allows everyone to use your                                 invention under the conditions of your                                 choice                                 but does it make sense to invest a lot                                 of money                                 to then open it up again no it doesn't                                 so again it's easy                                 publish it and do nothing else and then                                 embrace the fact                                 that no one including yourself can                                 dictate to anyone if and how the                                 hardware is used                                 but the truth is this doesn't seem easy                                 for people to accept and therefore to                                 understand i will get to this in a                                 moment i would just mention that um here                                 in europe and germany and i think in the                                 u.s too                                 we have more forms of property rights                                 that apply to hardware for example                                 design rights that protect a little bit                                 how something looks                                 or utility rights um or models that                                 protect                                 how something works it's basically just                                 the smaller version the cheaper version                                 but also weaker of a patent um                                 both of these uh property rights are                                 closer to the patent because you also                                 don't receive them automatically you                                 have to become active to file them                                 and uh it only works if what you want to                                 uh                                 protect is new so if the fact remains                                 star hardware is still born free                                 um if you want to learn more about this                                 uh other riots                                 uh just click uh here uh there's a full                                 lecture                                 on the whole situation so to sum it up                                 again                                 mention it one more time making hardware                                 open it's really easy                                 um from a legal point of view just                                 publish it and do nothing else                                 and of course use a copyright based                                 license to share                                 your editable documentation or design                                 files to make                                 proper open source hardware and make it                                 easy for others then to build upon your                                 work                                 so but how to deal then with the fact                                 that you can tell others what they can                                 do with your design and but not                                 that there is no copy left for example                                 and the answer is simply                                 live with it and design your business                                 strategy accordingly                                 you know if people would understand that                                 we would have a really healthy open                                 hardware licensing situation the problem                                 is                                 most people don't for people this is not                                 easy to understand                                 and accept they they just don't like it                                 i think it just doesn't click                                 instead you find a lot of really really                                 weird things                                 out there that make the situation                                 heavily broken                                 and i want to show you two issues first                                 people think they can use a copyright                                 based license                                 for their hardware ideas and                                 they even use copyright based licenses                                 with a non-commercial clause                                 and then call their work open source                                 there are a lot of prominent                                 examples that do this okay let me just                                 show you a little bit what's going on                                 there i think                                 if you're interested in hardware and                                 making you have probably seen this                                 yourself that people use copyright based                                 licenses                                 next to their hardware in a way that                                 creates the impression                                 that this license is actually protecting                                 the hardware                                 and usually they are under the                                 impressions in themselves                                 and you find this even on so-called                                 maker platforms that no                                 should know better i'll show you uh an                                 example here on instructables which is a                                 very                                 old platform for this here you see a                                 simple                                 hardware project and look up here in the                                 corner                                 there's a creative commons license and                                 if you click on this                                 then you see just the text of the                                 license                                 no explanation what this license                                 basically                                 is for here's another example from an                                 upcoming maker platform called                                 wikifactory                                 and here you see the same issue come on                                 please load                                 yes here is a drone and up here you see                                 there is a license uh also a creative                                 commons license and if you click on this                                 again you will find an                                 explanation of the license but not an                                 explanation what this licensee                                 actually uh is for or talks about                                 so tell me as an outsider without any                                 knowledge would you have thought that                                 these designs i just showed you are                                 protected by these licenses                                 how would you have interpreted this i                                 think                                 most people think yes of course the                                 license applies to the uh                                 shown uh project but                                 um yeah and so people when they upload                                 something on instructables they will                                 think that their invention is protected                                 with this license but it is not                                 and i looked around at the instructables                                 website and i found only                                 one source where they actually explain                                 that this license is just about                                 documentation or not about the hardware                                 itself                                 and i show you this article                                 [Music]                                 this information is here in the last                                 part of the article                                 the article is                                              and has only                                                       so it's basically hidden you know                                 and this is really really a problem                                 because it creates false expectations                                 among content creators                                 and more importantly it fosters false                                 motivations                                 people do not really understand how                                 sharing design                                 hardware design solutions on the web                                 really works and how the law supports it                                 actually how the law supports us is                                 quite good it's basically                                 pretty much in favor of open source                                 hardware but people don't understand                                 this                                 and this means that their collaborative                                 potential is                                 locked to a big extent and i really                                 think that these platforms                                 need to be fixed they need to                                 communicate very clearly to their                                 content creators and the audience that                                 these licenses                                 are about documentation and everyone                                 who's on that platform should really                                 understand                                 that if they put something there it                                 becomes free hardware everyone can make                                 with it whatever they want to                                 unless of course they have a patent or                                 design rights filed up front                                 or the designers some kind of artwork                                 yeah so uh maybe just one idea the                                 platform should write something like                                 this documentation is shared under a                                 creative commons license the hardware is                                 itself is not                                 and then put an explanation there so                                 that really the public                                 and content created creators gets uh get                                 educated about the situation                                 and here's an even worse problem it's a                                 highly problematic form of the thing                                 above you very often                                 in the world of hardware and making see                                 something like this this is a screenshot                                 from a                                 company that shares something as it's a                                 table                                 as open source under a creative commons                                 non-commercial license                                 so people publish their work as open                                 source under non-commercial license this                                 is wrong                                 on so many levels and problems that                                 those levels start to interact with each                                 other                                 which then creates really bizarre and                                 harmful effects                                 to tackle this i created a couple of                                 months ago with the help of others                                 and fhq and i just want to show you a                                 little bit uh                                 some parts of this fhq to                                 give you a little bit of of an                                 impression how big and weird                                 of a problem this is of course the fhq                                 starts here with the explanation that uh                                 non-commercial is not open source and                                 that all the                                 openness and open source definitions                                 explicitly allow                                 commercial use also free software and                                 then                                 i want to show you here um question                                 number                                 seven you could ask this uh now also                                 i just explained to you why that                                 creative commons licenses because they                                 are copyright based don't apply to                                 hardware what's the problem then                                 and the problem is that um the law is no                                 binary system you know um still can                                 people uh can sue you uh and claiming                                 that these uh                                 their copyright their creative commons                                 license indeed does                                 protect the hardware and then it goes to                                 court and there sits a judge                                 and he has to made a decision                                 and part of the decision that the judge                                 makes is to figure out                                 which law actually applies and there                                 could be                                 really weird situations where a creative                                 commerce license                                 maybe still applies to your hardware                                 it's not very likely but if you're for                                 example an artist                                 it could work but the problem is that                                 you                                 have this legal risk that you have to go                                 to court and this                                 takes a lot of time energy money and who                                 would want it                                 you know the lego brick for example is a                                 functionality                                 it had a patent and that patent expired                                 and then                                 lego tried for decades in courts to                                 still protect it with other forms of                                 property rights for example                                 with three-dimensional trademarks all of                                 this failed                                 but it was uh more than a decade                                 fight in court and who would want to go                                 to court you are right but you know who                                 wants to spend this time                                 so it's a legal risk that you get sued                                 and this legal risk is some kind of                                 thin layer of protection who wants to go                                 to court if you                                 if you want to change the world or make                                 just a cool hardware project                                 and the second thing is that you enter                                  territory because the people                                 misuse um an uh creative commons license                                 to signal hey i don't want you to use                                 this                                 uh in any way and especially not                                 commercially                                 you have all rights to do this but if                                 you do it                                 then maybe you will get a storm                                 because the public doesn't know that you                                 have the right and that what you do is                                 the right thing                                 they will think uh you're an uh                                 they will not understand and there's a                                 very prominent example here where                                 makerbot who was started as an open                                 source company and then they made a move                                 who was uh closing something but this                                 move was                                     legitimate but the people just don't got                                 it and make a bot received a big                                 storm                                 unjustified and here's a story about                                 cory from uh                                 conductor who explains you this so this                                 is another uh                                 threat that is out there that you might                                 be seen                                 as an while you are not um so                                 those two things are basically a form of                                 protection                                 and the second thing is a scope                                 explosion                                 yes remember that a patent can only last                                 for                                                                                                    up to                                                                 copyright back actually protects my                                 hardware you                                 calmly try to extend the the time of                                 protection for your hardware                                 for more than                                                           scope because you can get a patent just                                 for things that are new but copyright as                                 i told you                                 can apply to also to remix of old ideas                                 and i want to show you here one of the                                 very really weird examples                                 there are this is group they make this                                 xyz                                 tables and bikes and they of course make                                 this strange move                                 it's open source under a non-commercial                                 license                                 but what actually do they want to                                 protect here                                 is it that xyz connection that's really                                 all here's just one                                 uh one example of more than                                           ago the famous reed field chair                                 used this xy that connection or is it                                 that they use standard beams you can get                                 in every hardware store                                 so there is no way they can protect this                                 with with our given law but they                                 misuse the creative commons license to                                 pretend                                 they own this and therefore they take                                 something that belongs to all of                                 us and try to make it exclusively here                                 theirs                                 so you can really steal with the misuse                                 of a creative commons license                                 from the comments and yet those people                                 call their projects                                 open source so                                 yeah that's i think the proper reaction                                 there                                 so um uh yeah                                 these two problems are really heavy so                                 what to do about it um                                 and i thought maybe we could try uh some                                 collective action                                 to clean the situation                                 uh and i to fix it so i created a                                 campaign                                 i launched it this morning and i just                                 want to show you a little bit uh                                 what it is it's not very complex but you                                 can maybe                                 join it um here the campaign of course                                 it can                                 explains a little bit of what is the                                 problem here and then there are these um                                 little memes non-commercial is not open                                 source                                 and here's then are the memes about the                                 documentation                                 and maybe that helps i think when i                                 entered this world                                                                                                       like that on the web it would have made                                 me think and i would probably have                                 understood quite quickly what's going on                                 here um                                 maybe uh and here is uh the proposal for                                 the collective campaign                                 first of all uh the memes i just showed                                 you                                 share them post them send them whenever                                 you see someone uh                                 uh doing a wrong thing or uh aim of                                 trying to claim property rights for                                 something they can claim property rights                                 for using a creative commons license                                 just calmly post one of these uh uh                                 one of these uh gifts or memes maybe                                 that would help you can add an                                 explanation                                 or just post it without an explanation i                                 think this would work equally well                                 the second thing you could do um i had                                 the pleasure to work many years with the                                 openness activist uh                                 sam your head and he made a really bold                                 move whenever he saw someone on the web                                 posting something as                                 open source using a non-commercial                                 license he just wrote them a personal                                 email this email was very friendly but                                 strong                                 worded and very precise he explains what                                 the situation is and how to fix it                                 and he told me usually with success and                                 i think let's all be brave like sam                                 if you see a project like this uh sam                                 was uh                                 very um cool i asked him to share this                                 um                                 email on the web and here is we can all                                 use it                                 and copy it and send it to those                                 projects and ask them                                 please change the license please stop to                                 mis-educate                                 the public about how open source works                                 and what it actually is                                 uh for um yeah                                 it's very well written and then the the                                 third thing maybe the biggest um                                 thing but maybe the most promising lever                                 let's just all ask                                 uh the platforms um send them                                 uh an email and ask them please change                                 your communication maybe put it                                 to turn into something like this this                                 documentation is shared under                                 a creative commons license but this                                 license does not apply to the                                 documentation but usually                                 and not to the documented project itself                                 and then have a little info link and                                 really educate everyone                                 what's the situation and that the stuff                                 on the platform                                 is probably free hardware and we all can                                 explore it commercially                                 build upon it freely and this is a great                                 thing                                 and they should really uh embrace this                                 uh if you want to send this email it                                 would be awesome uh i also created an                                 email template uh                                 i can't write as that well uh as good as                                 sam your head                                 so maybe you have to um rewrite my                                 little email here                                 uh but you can also use it as this and i                                 think if a couple of us                                 maybe send this email maybe they start                                 uh thinking and change this                                 communication i think                                 this could change really really really a                                 lot                                 just a little uh reminder if we did this                                 the campaign                                 successfully the problem                                 some parts of the problems would be                                 solved but not everything                                 but it would be an important step i just                                 want to                                 remind you that i explained about that                                 the problem is that in software the                                 situation is                                 always clear there is copyright                                 and there is a standard way to deal with                                 it and make it open                                 so open source software licenses you see                                 a piece of software                                 you know there's a way to figure out the                                 intention of the creators                                 you find a license or not and then                                 you're good to go the problem with                                 hardware is                                 that it's not clear if there                                 are any proper opportu property rights                                 at                                 all and if there's uh if there are some                                 files                                 which one you just can't know if this is                                 free or                                 someone has a patent or a design rights                                 unless you                                 spend a lot of time researching uh this                                 so and even if it would be free or if it                                 would                                 be closed there is just no standard way                                 to signal to the outside world                                 what is the case so you have no way to                                 figure out what's the situation                                 is this uh free uh free software and as                                 a creator a free hardware as a creator                                 free hardware you have no standard way                                 to signal to people                                 hey this is really free hardware i never                                 filed a patent i will never file design                                 rights you can do with it whatever you                                 like                                 please do um and i think this is uh                                 something we could we should discuss in                                 the open source hardware community                                 what should could be a standard way                                 maybe there's a standard way i'm not                                 aware of                                 but yeah how standard can it be when i'm                                 not really aware of                                 i just show you how we do this with our                                 little design studio                                 we created uh this public promise which                                 is a little bit                                 like a like a license of course not                                 checked by a lawyer but in this public                                 promise                                 we just explained that we will never                                 ever                                 file a patent which would not work for                                 our staff anyway and we will                                 never make use of our design rights in                                 what way and that we want this um                                 statement to be legally binding for us                                 so this is our way to give people the                                 freedom                                 hey there's this is really open and we                                 want you to do visit whatever you see                                 fit and we put this uh                                 public promise on design rights uh below                                 here next to our creative commons                                 license which of course applies to all                                 our articles                                 and the documentation of our hardware                                 and campaign projects and so on                                 um yeah but is this a way is                                 an idea for a standard way i'm not sure                                 i mean it's just a                                 how we do this but maybe this there                                 could be a fruitful discussion                                 yeah thank you for listening and i just                                 want to uh                                 highlight one more time why this is                                 important uh                                 open hardware could really be an super                                 important and fantastic tool to deal                                 with the challenges that will uh we will                                 have to face in the future                                 climate change biodiversity collapse uh                                 resource exchange                                 exhaustion we need open hardware could                                 really help with it but open hardware is                                 really                                 not enabled to grow and one of the big                                 reasons is that there are these weird                                 misunderstandings                                 about the licensing about the legal                                 situation unless this is fixed                                 uh open hardware cannot really make huge                                 next steps you can argue that the whole                                 free software and open source                                 software uh movement started with this                                 uh                                 legal hacked of the of the uh do public                                 license that it started from a legal                                 situation                                 and uh there is no similar situation                                 here in hardware and this is um really a                                 problem and i think this is a                                 an interesting lever if we want to push                                 open hardware forward                                 thank you for your uh attention please                                 join the campaign if you like it uh                                 let's do something let's clean up the                                 web and uh move towards a better world                                 thank you lars what an inspiring                                 endpoint point to finish on thank you                                 and                                 we have one question so far already for                                 lars                                 don't be shy i'm going to point where i                                 think the chat box may be which is there                                 if i'm mirrored                                 and there if i'm not mirrored and my                                 first question then                                 to you lars comes from sriram which is                                 about the                                 open web foundation licenses which are                                 designed specifically for open hardware                                 apparently                                 do you recognize these licenses as being                                 valid                                 in your case and if not why not i must                                 say                                 that uh actually i might have been an                                 educational holder i don't know these                                 licenses                                 but if they are copyright based uh which                                 is                                 i don't know them but it's probably the                                 case that they are copyright based um                                 then they it's the same with the                                 creative commons licenses there's also                                 discern open hardware                                 license there are licenses that are made                                 for                                 open hardware but they're all if you                                 really read them carefully are made for                                 the copyrighted parts                                 so for the design files but not for the                                 hardware itself and this confusion                                 confusion is really something we need to                                 tackle                                 interesting and a question from me then                                 you said that                                 making your hardware open requires doing                                 nothing except                                 publishing it in public but what does                                 that mean if you don't have                                 digitized artifacts already like cad                                 files or                                 or similar similar documents how can you                                 how can you do that effectively so it's                                 in the comments                                 i mean uh when you can                                 post it on facebook post it in a                                 facebook group about um                                 about hardware and making post it on                                 twitter you know                                 just make sure that it's relatively                                 prominent because uh if you're                                 if you try to file a patent is someone                                 and checks if this invention is already                                 out there in the world                                 and um now nowadays the world is so                                 complex that no one can really                                 see every source and maybe then your                                 patent                                 is um is granted although it uh what you                                 try to patent is already prior art                                 uh but then you will win in court you                                 can show no i really made this public uh                                 in this facebook group uh two years ago                                 and so on                                 and uh there a lot of people are afraid                                 that                                 large companies come and steal their                                 ideas and then they patent it                                 which i have never heard of a case where                                 this actually happens because                                 it really doesn't make sense for a large                                 company to do this                                 mostly because they would lose in court                                 and usually they are really                                 uh well equipped with engineers they can                                 just recreate the idea in a little bit                                 different way                                 instead of taking the legal risk there                                 to to go with you to court and lose it                                 and then                                 have a lot of damage to their public                                 appearance and so on                                 thank you so so if there's no digital                                 files then uh                                 you might i mean it is publishing                                 photographs or a long description of the                                 the process the mechanical items if it's                                 not a printed circuit board or you don't                                 have the files for that                                 what's the minimum criteria to qualify                                 as being                                 published in the commons would you say                                 i don't know everything you can come up                                 with to explain                                 what your your idea your functionality                                 is                                 i mean some people say that uh having an                                 a patent is                                 uh basically also an open source file                                 which is not the case because you can                                 see a patent it describes the                                 functionality but it will not                                 often not help you to actually build the                                 device                                 but this also teaches us that a very                                 minimal description of the mechanism                                 or your idea should cover                                 cover you and really make it public                                 was it clear yes i think so thank you so                                 i'll follow up with another question                                 um yeah so you mentioned the design and                                 utility rights that                                 can augment the other kinds of rights                                 and means of protecting the the freedom                                 of your open hardware                                 to what degree are those internationally                                 enforceable i think you mentioned                                 uh they might be specific to germany or                                 how does that work                                 yeah i know that they're in europe                                 there's this uh design rights for                                 things uh that uh how something looks                                 and um and and uh                                 as i said i really didn't research how                                 for example is the situation in japan or                                 in mongolia for example but i'm pretty                                 sure that discovers the situation in in                                 europe                                 that we have this utility uh models and                                 this uh design rights                                 um so throughout the european union                                 member states                                 we can be confident that we can fall                                 back on those if we first apply for them                                 and are granted them for our hardware                                 projects                                 pretty much that's how what how i                                 understood it yeah                                 great and is there a way of requiring                                 derivative works of open hardware                                 projects                                 to remain in the commons similar to how                                 copyleft works with software                                 yeah and that's that's the issue no                                 no there is not and that's maybe the                                 biggest                                 problem people have it's really                                 you can post something then it's uh open                                 a functionality and someone can take                                 your functionality and make a little                                 extra invention                                 on top that only works because there is                                 this space and then this person can                                 close it                                 for everyone including yourself uh                                 but that's the way there is no way to                                 way around this there is just no way to                                 fix it there's only one way to fix it uh                                 change your expectation deal with the                                 fact that this                                 won't ever happen and then design your                                 business strategy or your hardware                                 strategy                                 around this fact live with it whatever                                 we do is designed like this we are happy                                 we know that we have                                 no way to really put any conditions out                                 there what people do with our stuff                                 and and that's really the key message                                 here we have to                                 live with it and then start to design                                 the discussion and everything from there                                 and that would be a fantastic point                                 because it might look at the first oh                                 okay then i lose my                                 invention but it also means there are so                                 many inventions you can use                                 for free build on them you know you have                                 so much freedom from this we all                                 it's it's a it's a win for all of us but                                 that's the thing that's so hard for                                 people to understand i think                                 so prior art gives you no defense in                                 that case like                                 can you it can be so iterative so                                 minutes an extension                                 in the hardware field that uh another                                 company can get a patent                                 even if uh prior art exists for your                                 your previous iteration of the work                                 yes for example you are let's say you                                 have a                                 nuts and bolts are prior art for for                                 centuries now                                 but still someone could come up with a                                 new uh way to have a uh                                 to make the mechanism on top i just                                 can't find the word right now                                 they can patent this of course then you                                 have this specific form of nut or bold                                 uh is then closed again it's possible                                 always yeah                                 and live visit that's the key message                                 i have another question for you then um                                 about the                                 uh legal recourse when um                                 yeah like you've mentioned a few                                 different ways of reaching out to                                 organizations who are claiming copyright                                 covers                                 uh open hardware which in fact it                                 doesn't is there any                                 is there any alternative uh any any more                                 maybe for those organizations who don't                                 reply like you seem to have experienced                                 yourself because you've sent notices to                                 some of those websites you shared                                 earlier                                 but they're still claiming uh creative                                 commons licenses for hardware files and                                 so on                                 is there any other recourse or any other                                 option                                 to to push or or let's say coerce those                                 organizations into uh ceasing to claim                                 something that isn't true about the                                 licensing of their hardware                                 uh not that i know of i mean who wants                                 to sue them                                 or you know who wants to go there no i                                 mean just uh ask them politely and um                                 that's what's so fantastic about this                                 text by sam he told me that it usually                                 worked you know not                                 not always but it usually worked and                                 maybe that's also maybe the experiment                                 with these memes you know look at these                                 memes and what they try to subtle                                 communicate maybe this also helps push                                 people                                 uh uh across the edge and really make                                 sure                                 great                                 you
