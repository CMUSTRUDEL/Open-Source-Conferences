	Link to the public slides of this talk: https://opencircularity.info/osh-licenses/

While the situation around licensing in software is always worth a debate and not quite as settled as it could be the situation for hardware is much worse. There are a lot of misconceptions out there about how to license hardware designs. This talk will show you some of the common misunderstandings, highlight the open questions, propose some collective action to fix the situation and yes - of course - also explain how things are done the right way. 

The talk will be a summary and extended version of the public FAQ "Why are Creative Commons Non Commercial licenses not Open Source and a big problem in hardware and product design".
