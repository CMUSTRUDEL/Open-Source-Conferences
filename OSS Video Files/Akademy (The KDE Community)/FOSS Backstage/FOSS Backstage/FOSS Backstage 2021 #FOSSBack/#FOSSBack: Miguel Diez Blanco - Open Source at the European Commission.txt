	                              my name is                               miguel diaz i i work at a digit in the                               european commission                               which is basically for the ones who know                               his european commission is organizing                               different directorates and i work in the                               one which is responsible for informatics                               the                               digit digit and um yeah what i plan to                                do in the next                                minutes is just to give you an overview                                of first the open source strategy                                which was released in october                                last year and then i will explain some                                of the things we are doing right now                                related to                                to open source so                                regarding the this strategy as i said                                before is public you can check it out if                                you want and there is the link                                afterwards in the final slide um                                it was released in october last year and                                is not in fact the first strategy that                                we released it was it's in fact the                                fifth iteration of previous ones                                that initially they were local let's say                                to our directorate in digit                                since we were in contact with open                                source in year                                                  producing different strategies                                uh that were evolving with our expertise                                um and as until last year when we did                                this final one which is different than                                the previous ones because                                the previous one as i said it was for us                                it was a document just for dg digit to                                to organize ourselves to to have our own                                strategy but this one                                it's a strategy that involves the whole                                commission so                                with this strategy the whole commission                                is adopting a position towards open                                source                                that was not formalized before and uh                                which is a big change                                and we like to apply this this this                                motor thing open because that's what we                                are trying to                                to achieve it's to change the culture                                within commission                                which in fact was already happening uh                                we will get into details later                                but to have it in this formalized                                strategy involving the entire commission                                is is a huge step for us and we are very                                proud of it                                the strategy comes with an action plan                                is                                is                                                         through all of them because that will                                take a lot of time but i will                                i will focus on the ones that i believe                                are more relevant                                and the ones we are working on right now                                and the first one and this is something                                we see                                happening more and more often in the                                public environment is the creation of an                                open source program office                                probably in the private environment that                                was happening already a few years ago                                but um in the public environment that                                was                                not happening as often we see now that                                more and more                                different organizations they are having                                this                                um body uh                                within the organization and in our case                                yes we                                that's the first action we did it uh                                together with the strategy in october                                and for an ospo                                there are different definitions but in                                our case                                our mission what we try to do at least                                in this                                first stage is first of all to promote                                open source practices within commission                                uh provide support and guidance to the                                open source projects                                and as well to those projects that want                                to become open source                                we represent as well commission in open                                source events                                like like this one and um                                we we try to do networking also we are                                in contact with other ospos                                and finally of course this action plan                                 that i mentioned before we are the                                 responsibles to make sure                                 it's it's happening so um                                 now thinking more about this action plan                                 uh i will explain some of them um i                                 explained the declaration of the us                                 already the                                 action number two is what we call inner                                 source                                 as default so applying open source                                 within within commission and we like                                 this picture because it's                                 basically about breaking silos it's                                 about                                 sharing the code that we do making it                                 open                                 accessible to to other teams so that                                 they can benefit from the code that we                                 produce                                 um you have to know that commission is                                 very big                                 we are more than                                                      and that's without                                 considering the the consultants and                                 in every digit we produce a lot of                                 applications we produce                                 a lot of code we were checking in our                                 git repository                                 a couple of weeks ago and we had at                                 least more than                                                                                                        even more                                 and we learned that not all of them are                                 open                                 not not all of them the code is                                 accessible to the other teams                                 in fact um when we checked we                                 only could see                                                           which means that we have a lot of code                                 we have a lot of software that is not                                 being seen by all the teams and this is                                 a pity                                 we cannot capitalize on the things we do                                 we might be doing things twice                                 we cannot contribute and that's not good                                 for the organization so                                 what we are trying to do now in our git                                 repository is to make sure that for                                 every new project                                 when you start with an um with yeah                                 developing code by default your code                                 will be visible to the other teams                                 and we do not expect that by that people                                 are going to start doing pull requests                                 all of a sudden but at least it's the                                 first step                                 to make this switch that i was                                 mentioning before                                 this thing open that we want and about                                 sharing                                 so that's uh an interesting action                                 action three                                 um if before i was talking about inner                                 source                                 so working or adopting open source                                 internally                                 this is more about our presence outside                                 outside commission we do have                                 currently projects that are open source                                 that are available in github                                 but they are isolated cases and we do                                 not have                                 an official european commission account                                 where we as a blog we are present in                                 gitlab in github                                 and we see that other governmental                                 organizations like nasa                                 or the european space agency they are                                 already there and                                 we should be there as well we should                                 have our own presence in github                                 and have contributions from the open                                 source communities                                 uh in a structured way so as part of                                 this action the us boys in contact with                                 the                                 technical teams in charge of our git                                 repositories                                 to make sure that we go out there with                                 our open source projects                                 in a official and organized way so                                 that's something we are working on as                                 well                                 then uh action four um                                 this is about changing the way we                                 distribute our software                                 what you see in this screen is something                                 that we call                                 a commission decision it's a document                                 that                                 development teams in commission they                                 have to produce if they want to go                                 open source they have to draft a cover                                 node they have to                                 uh to to to write this document                                 then they have to have it approved then                                 there is an inter-service consultation                                 and if everything if everything is fine                                 and if everybody agrees                                 then this development team they can go                                 outside they can put their code                                 outside as open source as you can see                                 it's a heavy process and                                 when we see that development teams they                                 have to do that                                 in order to get their their code as open                                 we see that this is very discouraging                                 and so                                 the ospo we are working with um                                 other teams in commission to change that                                 process and that                                 instead of having to do all these                                 administrative paperwork                                 if a development team they want to go                                 open source and put their code in github                                 by default they can do it there is no                                 necessary                                 it's not necessary to do this paperwork                                 and                                 we hope that by that teams they are                                 a bit they feel relieved and they can go                                 easily to put their code because we know                                 that                                 we have this willingness to do that but                                 these administrative steps we know that                                 they are                                 discouraging certain teams to do so so                                 we hope that by changing these rules                                 we will invite our teams to more and                                 more contribute to putter code                                 in the different git repositories and                                 being part of the community                                 now another action we call it the open                                 source                                 innovation labs this is something else                                 we are working on                                 it's about setting up a control                                 environment and protected where we can                                 test                                 open source products with the aim of                                 uh finally adopting them in our app                                 story                                 in our set of tools that we use every                                 day and                                 we before christmas we were asking all                                 the different dgs in commission                                 okay we are launching this um do you                                 have any ideas what products would you                                 like to test                                 and it was very surprising to see uh                                 the amount of responses that we got of                                 people proposing ideas                                 open source products that go from                                 artificial intelligence to                                 desktop solutions please test this this                                 is a good thing please                                 and we were very pleased to have this                                 amount now we have a nice problem which                                 is to decide                                 what we do first but getting back again                                 to                                 did what i was saying that commission is                                 already changing the mood                                 that's already a good sign that the                                 strategy that we are coming                                 it's good it's a way to officialize but                                 we already noticed                                 that there is a trend already in                                 commission to                                 yeah to look more into open source and                                 adopt open source practices                                 so we hope that with this innovation                                 labs we do interesting discoveries                                 and yeah eventually that they fulfill                                 cases                                 where we need these products                                 okay next action this is about                                 outreach the community so getting closer                                 to                                 open source communities i have                                 divided it into four sub-actions                                 and this is something we are doing as                                 part of the isa square program                                 maybe some of you know isa squared is a                                 program                                 that is running for many years that                                 tends to promote interoperability                                 and reusability across across the eu                                 in public services and with these funds                                 that we                                 have received with ice square we are                                 doing these                                 four sub-actions and the first one that                                 we are doing is launching a study                                 about the funding mechanisms existing in                                 europe                                 of course we know that they are open                                 source funds like the apache foundation                                 linux foundation but we want to know                                 whether there are                                 still open source communities that die                                 they are not being                                 helped enough despite having these                                 funds available we want to know what is                                 out there we want to know                                 if there are any gaps if there are any                                 communities that they need extra help                                 financially or maybe not financially but                                 just                                 support communication security                                 and we would like to have this picture                                 of how well served is the open source                                 community                                 in terms of funding because who knows                                 maybe                                 we once we see this study and we see                                 these gaps we can say hey                                 maybe commission they can do something                                 maybe there is a                                 particular area where we could have i                                 don't know                                 um european open source fund that maybe                                 could tackle those cases that currently                                 are missed that                                 and um we see we are very interesting to                                 know what                                 uh this study will uh will tell us                                 and eventually what we want is to avoid                                 things like what you see in the picture                                 in this image where                                 it reminds me about the heartbleed                                 attack that happened a few years ago                                 where you have the entire internet                                 using the openssl library who knows how                                 many people were behind that library                                 maybe                                 if that component would have been better                                 supported                                 maybe we wouldn't have had the losses                                 the millions of years of losses that we                                 had                                 so we are really interested to know what                                 this study is giving us and whether we                                 can help once we know                                 how the landscape looks like                                 still with the ice square program what                                 we are doing                                 the second sub initiative it's um                                 european of open source inventory                                 and maybe inventory is a big word                                 because of course we don't think we are                                 going to cover                                 all the public institutions in europe                                 but we want to know                                 across europe across the eu from all the                                 different                                 public administrations which open source                                 products they are using                                 with the ultimate goal of knowing which                                 are the most                                 critical ones the ones that are more                                 heavily used                                 and eventually see whether we can as                                 well                                 help those products maybe running back                                 bounties to make them more secure                                 or maybe with some funding um                                 the idea is again to sustain                                 sustain these products that they are                                 giving already a service                                 and and see whether eventually                                 commission could help                                 so we are running this study                                 with an external firm they are helping                                 us they are serving the different public                                 administrations in europe at different                                 levels                                 we they are talking to cities they are                                 talking to regions                                 to national governments and they asking                                 them okay which open source tools are                                 you using                                 and what is the criticality how often do                                 you use them for what purposes                                 and um yeah we're looking forward to see                                 what it comes out of it and i                                 i take the opportunity for the attendees                                 the people listening to this that                                 if you are working for a european                                 institution                                 and

is                                 hackathons this is something we already                                 did in the past                                 with a project that some of you might                                 know it was called fosa                                  it was very successful we were doing                                 back bounties as well

will                                 be virtual but yes that's uh we are                                 planning to do two of them during the                                 first half of                                       we have a pretty clear ideas of we want                                 what we want to do it will be published                                 soon                                 and again the aim of this action seven                                 as the                                 as the other three set actions before is                                 just to get again in contact with                                 open source communities bring them                                 together share knowledge share                                 experiences                                 and overall yeah help the                                 the the community so                                 this action seven was a bit longer and                                 we do have more as you saw in the action                                 plan                                 we had                                                                 our governance procedures like consider                                 open source when we evaluate projects                                 others it's about a communication plan                                 that we are doing                                 inside commission to promote open source                                 uh we are also working on                                 trainings uh for uh our staff                                 to get more acquainted to open source we                                 are                                 also in the hr part we at some point we                                 will get                                 at the recruiting profiles to to see                                 whether we can include also the open                                 source                                 dimension when we are for selection                                 criteria                                 so as you can see we are very busy and                                 we are very exciting anyway we are very                                 happy                                 and at the end as i said the ultimate                                 goal is to                                 change the mentality of commission                                 i forgot to say that it's something that                                 it's an internal strategy it's something                                 that we do                                 for the organization um i say that                                 because at the beginning when the                                 strategy was released                                 some people said thought okay you are                                 doing something for the eu you are                                 promoting something                                 and no for the moment it's just a                                 strategy for                                 us uh for the organization to change our                                 culture                                 and to embrace ultimately uh open source                                 both in terms of practices mentality and                                 as well as                                 as tools so                                 uh that's all i wanted to to talk about                                 in case you have questions                                 you can reach us in this email address                                 digit.ospo                                 and if you

your time i                                 hope i gave you a nice overview of what                                 we are doing                                 and if you have questions please feel                                 free feel free to shoot                                 thank you very much for your time                                 that was awesome thank you um                                 questions should be coming in soon                                 hopefully there's been no questions yet                                 but i think that's maybe because people                                 are writing them uh personally i think                                 that's awesome i really appreciated the                                 work that you're doing i think that's a                                 really great inner strategy                                 session i have a couple of questions uh                                 while we're waiting for people to send                                 them in                                 okay my first question is innovation lab                                 sounds awesome that seems really cool                                 that you're testing these things and                                 trying to see you know what's good and                                 what can be used by the ec                                 is there any plans to release the output                                 of the innovations labs of how that                                 testing process went                                 well actually new was not initially                                 planned to release it uh because                                 we thought indeed in in terms of                                 internal strategy so uh                                 it was not the initial idea but                                 uh i think we will see if uh something                                 we didn't check maybe there's no problem                                 in                                 in sharing uh what we are using in fact                                 there's no secret to say that we already                                 have in our app store                                 things like libreoffice like firefox                                 so i think it should not be an issue to                                 say afterwards look we are adding                                 uh element or moodle or yeah so                                 in theory i don't think it should be an                                 issue                                 excellent um i love that okay first                                 question in the question tab                                 uh when you allow going open source as                                 default and got rid of the process                                 how do you ensure that the projects                                 confirm uh conform with licenses and                                 export laws                                 to the developers that's a good question                                 because i i forget to say that                                 that indeed we are removing these legal                                 this administrative steps but there is a                                 step that will stay there which is this                                 uh out intellectual property checks that                                 uh                                 the joint research center is doing so we                                 are helping the development teams they                                 will not have to do that paperwork                                 that's good                                 but we will not uh we will continue                                 doing of course the intellectual                                 property checks so that will stay                                 continuing as a control                                 but at least the development teams they                                 will not have to write those                                 allow me to say boring documents yeah                                 thank you for doing that work on behalf                                 of all developers everywhere                                 so still waiting for another question um                                 i have more questions                                 you mentioned bringing some stuff                                 internally and mentioned trying to give                                 back by maybe opening up a                                 european commission fund i love that                                 idea that's awesome                                 what are you doing to help make sure                                 that people on european commission time                                 are actually able to collaborate                                 effectively with projects that aren't                                 under the european commission banner                                 yeah that's something we have asked                                 ourselves and it's a tricky                                 it's a tricky point that we have not                                 find the answer yet because                                 we are a public institution okay so we                                 we use                                 taxpayers money and that translates into                                 projects with a limited budget you have                                 a project manager in commission i have                                 my budget i need to deliver                                 so when you will have a developer saying                                 look i want                                 friday this afternoon to contribute to                                 other projects                                 the manager will say okay how do we do                                 this because i                                 i need to justify your time we are using                                 public money                                 so who knows maybe it's uh                                 maybe we have a clause that says                                 if it's something incidentally an                                 incidental contribution that's allowed                                 you don't even need to check to your                                 line manager                                 we're still working on that but um it's                                 a good point because we we                                 ourselves we are trying to find the                                 answer to that                                 excellent um still waiting for more                                 questions it looks like it's just me                                 being able to ask all the questions i                                 want to ask which is                                 kind of fun um still five minutes left                                 that anyone is curious you mentioned at                                 the beginning                                 ospos what are you doing to make sure                                 you collaborate with other ospos or                                 osborne organizations                                 yeah well we attend to international                                 events open source events but also with                                 open forum europe we are in contact with                                 them and they put us                                 in contact with other hospitals which is                                 very interesting we learned a lot from                                 from them                                 um like the ospo in the ministry of                                 technology in israel it's they are very                                 advanced and it's very amazing to see                                 what they are doing                                 vice versa united nations they are                                 looking at us because                                 they want to know what we have done so                                 it's                                 uh basically yes we are keeping this um                                 this network thanks to being involved                                 with other organizations                                 but now we are planning also to start                                 leading ourselves                                 uh workshops with that we can organize                                 ourselves                                 and we will start being active as well                                 and proactive and contacting                                 different organizations and to establish                                 some                                 regular uh meetings as well to catch up                                 and to share knowledge                                 i'm excited about that too i want to get                                 involved somehow um although i'm not                                 european so maybe i can't                                 which actually reminds me of my next                                 question because again still waiting for                                 more questions if anyone has any                                 please feel free um                                 i know there's some european                                 commissioners not all of them but                                 there's definitely a movement                                 of digital sovereignty the idea that                                 code in the eu should stay in the eu                                 um how is this                                 internal plan deal with that sort of                                 thing                                 uh well it's it's linked this obvious                                 link                                 uh things uh as you said uh digital                                 sovereignty is one of the                                 objectives and it was mentioned by                                 vanderlaan several times                                 in her speeches so an open source we see                                 that as an enabler to that                                 so uh and um we                                 we basically uh and even in fact                                 now uh uh when we are asked for uh                                 uh open source products in in the case                                 of the innovation lab some of them they                                 were asking for a secure email solution                                 because they don't want to use                                 um another                                 another product so uh so yes it's very                                 interesting we think we consider that as                                 an enabler and that                                 of course is in our let's say                                 uh things to keep in mind when uh                                 having our role in in the osbo excellent                                 um good answer so uh                                 i have a question here um if paris gives                                 two hours                                 to your code can you give two hours to                                 paris can we create a time exchange                                 good idea that's uh so you meet the city                                 of paris uh                                 assumingly it's probably philippa ray                                 but i'm not sure                                 but that's that why not that that could                                 be a kind of arrangement that we could                                 do between                                 institutions to to have like envelopes                                 of hours that we could exchange                                 to to contribute to um yeah two                                 different projects why not that would be                                 that would be an interesting exchange                                 you
