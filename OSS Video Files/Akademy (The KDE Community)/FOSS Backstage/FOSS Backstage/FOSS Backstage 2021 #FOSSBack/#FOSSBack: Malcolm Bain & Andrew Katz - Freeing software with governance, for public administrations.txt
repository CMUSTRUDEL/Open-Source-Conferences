Title: #FOSSBack: Malcolm Bain & Andrew Katz - Freeing software with governance, for public administrations
Publication date: 2021-02-25
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Public Money, Public Code… but what are the best practices for public sector bodies to release new projects or share their own projects as FOSS? Why is it not "easy-peasy" (it certainly should be a "no-brainer")? Public sector bodies usually don’t have the staff with FOSS skills (certainly at management level, although they increasingly have developers who do, and are keen to embrace FOSS), they don’t have the time, and it is not a priority… even if there is a legal mandate. Two veteran open source lawyers present their experience in working with two public sector projects in the UK and Spain respectively, for publicly sharing code, with two totally different approaches looking for short term wins and long term sustainability. Governance? Contributions? Community Principles? High level inter-administration agreements? IP Management? Resources and funding? Navigating internal management?

You name, we have … no answers but maybe some hints that will help you work with local governments for freeing up public code.

	                              so                               legal legal but not too legal let's say                               that this one actually isn't is not                               it's not about licenses for once it's                               not about licenses                               or a little bit a little bit we can't                               avoid that um                               do you want me to kind of like present                               what we're going to do andrew and then                                you take over                                or um yeah well that that would be great                                if you want to um                                i was going to try to do everything i                                possibly could to avoid having to                                pronounce                                sanford but i can't just try to                                pronounce it so i will let you                                yeah give us a little background about                                that okay okay yeah                                so so what we're talking about actually                                is managing um governance and issues and                                sustainability                                in open source uh projects which are run                                or initiated by the public                                administration and                                um i think most of us know about how                                it's run in the private sector or by                                individuals in universities                                and the public sector has has some                                issues um which make it a little bit                                more complex                                uh it makes it more exciting because i                                think there's a there's a greater                                achievement                                to be done there but um the public                                sector does have rules about how they                                can operate and how they can work                                these vary from country to country which                                is why it's interesting to contrast                                my experience in spain and andrew's                                experience in                                um in the uk um just to say we are both                                lawyers we're both                                i would say open source lawyers we've                                been working in the sector now for                                way too long as you can see um but                                um and um but it's it's uh one of my                                i like working with open sources it's                                it's enjoyable it's challenging                                uh and there's always new things to do                                and at the moment i think public sector                                uh open source is is one of the really                                uh areas where things are happening                                and things can happen better if we can                                achieve                                um greater ways of freeing and using                                open source public open source                                and and achieving sustainability in                                their um                                in these projects so basically the                                presentation today is about                                uh two projects um working on uh well                                actually i've got two so it's three                                it's two on my side one on andy's side                                uh                                looking at how um open source was                                approached                                by our um respective clients in this                                respect                                um two cities uh why it's this is why                                it's a tale of two cities                                uh some philippe de jobregat i got that                                one right uh on my side and croydon                                on uh for andy okay so just just very                                briefly uh                                sanfilio is a suburb of barcelona where                                i live uh barcelona is obviously very                                open source it's got                                loads loads of projects it's got an open                                technologies uh plan                                it's got loads of stuff and um the                                cities around                                barcelona are actually working in this                                ecosystem and building stuff and sharing                                things                                um it's also part of the province the                                province has a                                regional government with a smart region                                initiative                                which is fully open based the the people                                working on the smart region                                uh are very much in favor of open source                                so we're in a context where actually                                which is quite positive                                it's a small town um not very many                                people probably about fifty thousand                                people in                                in in in inhabitants that the                                i.t departments are very small to eight                                 people working working there                                 and but as i said they're working                                 towards this open administration and and                                 in spain at least in catalonia open                                 administration means                                 digital open openly digital digitally                                 open                                 um and and i will be presenting a couple                                 of projects we're working with                                 to free uh the software and create some                                 community around these projects                                 over to you andrew yeah great thanks um                                 so if you ask                                 uh people from croydon about croydon                                 they will say that croydon um                                 is a small town in surrey um if you                                 actually                                 look at reality it's actually quite a                                 large um                                 town that is really part of greater                                 london it's in greater london and the                                 council                                 is actually quite a large council it's                                 unfortunately just become bankrupt but                                 anyway that's another story that doesn't                                 impinge on this                                 particular tale at all and it's got                                 quite a quite a large it department in                                 the council                                 and i'll talk a little bit more later                                 about how this project actually                                 developed but they do quite a lot of                                 their own                                 internal development and particularly                                 web development so the the story that                                 we're going to be talking about is                                 really you know how                                 they've looked at that web development                                 to decide that they can uh try to share                                 code with some of the other councils                                 um yeah there's now about                                                involved in this project                                 okay and that's actually one of the key                                 differences because um most                                 uh spanish at least the ones i know um                                 id departments in public sector are very                                 very                                 uh few people and they outsource and                                 they subcontract nearly all the i.t                                 development                                 um so this is basically for labor                                 reasons for finance budgeting                                 crediting going bust sound failure is                                 not quite going bust yet but                                 um it could be happening okay so let's                                 let's have a look at i'll explain                                 the projects i'm looking at and then                                 andy will explain his and we'll come                                 together again                                 um explaining a little bit uh what we                                 think um the issues are what the                                 challenges are what some good practices                                 are                                 okay so in our um in some video there's                                 really two projects totally different                                 um gd matrix is a really fairly old                                 project it started in                                       it's very mature it's gone through                                 various cycles it's been built                                 um for some philly                                 under several public contracts um it's                                 very complex it's a case management uh                                 information flow software for managing                                 uh you know public                                 files cases in in the public                                 administration so it's                                 one of the core elements of their                                 infrastructure                                 um it has obviously you know                                 public-facing interface so people can                                 upload their own files                                 whatever with authenticity and all that                                 type of thing so it's quite complex                                 um it's uh as i said it was built                                 uh from                                                 quite you know                                                         i wouldn't i wouldn't care to say how                                 many lines of code what's important is                                 how it was built so                                 actually built under public bid by a                                 private company as i said and it's                                 actually been the same company                                 over the years um they've they've had                                 new bids they've had different people                                 try to come in                                 and work with the code and be the                                 supplier                                 but in the end the same companies                                 managed probably due to its                                 advantage in knowing the code uh and                                 costs savings                                 to stay there so that's been uh good in                                 terms of continuity                                 uh bad in terms of of spreading the news                                 and spreading the the knowledge about                                 this code okay so it's very centralized                                 um                                 it's managed by one project manager in                                 in the um and                                 in in the uh municipality                                 um and it was built as code for the for                                 the uh minister                                 for okay so it wasn't actually kind of                                 built                                 to be freed as as some projects as the                                 next project is about so it was                                 wasn't necessarily built in an open                                 source manner with open source                                 methodologies and modular                                 and and you know iterative in in more                                 agile way                                 so it's more monolithic um old style but                                 freeable that's one of the issues we had                                 to look at was do the ip                                 clearance and and to see who owns the                                 code and how                                 but because this has been managed quite                                 strictly in fact it was not too                                 difficult                                 brain                                                                  totally didn't stay just about a year                                 old                                 it's the brainchild of a single member                                 of the i.t department the                                 project manager who did it as a separate                                 independent project                                 working on ai which is about a year and                                 a half ago you know                                 so the fashion these days and look at ai                                 and how that can be                                 used as a framework for doing for                                 supporting certain municipal services                                 so it's fresh new it was built to be                                 opened because                                 this is the the project manager who is                                 leading sponsoring                                 the concept of doing open source at some                                 philo                                 uh and so it's built uh on github                                 um actually closed github for the                                 beginning because he's a                                 a public sector official so he you know                                 doesn't he can't                                 open up the code until he's authorized                                 to do so                                 um but it was built to be open um which                                 changes enormously                                 uh how it's built from a technical point                                 of view uh the infrastructure where it's                                 built                                 uh because basically open freeing it                                 would basically be putting a license on                                 and clicking github making an open                                 repository whereas the other one needs a                                 huge amount of grooming                                 okay turn the page and let's see what                                 happens so as i said this is                                 um totally two different stories of                                 where the how the code got to this                                 situation that we want to free it                                 okay and the mandate is actually a                                 really good mandate because both the                                 political people in the council in favor                                 of this the technical people are in                                 favor                                 um even the legal department's in favor                                 which is which is always                                 very positive so everybody's behind this                                 um                                 and uh but we had to look at it from two                                 very different perspectives the one                                 interesting thing about gd matrix                                 is that it had already been shared with                                 other municipalities                                 under you know kind of public to public                                 agreements                                 uh private internal agreements i'd say                                 um                                 where you say we will share the code                                 with you uh and for free because that's                                 what the law says                                 we must do uh but there's no open source                                 community                                 feeling about it so there's no key pro                                 quo your contributions my contributions                                 centralized management single backlog                                 prioritization of issues nothing of that                                 sort it's just                                 we have this code if you want to use it                                 you can borrow it and here it is you can                                 use it                                 okay so that there wasn't there is a                                 beginning of a community there because                                 we have seven                                 or eight i think um cities which are                                 using this code                                 uh but just not in any collaborative                                 manner um                                 uh well specifically open source                                 collaborative manner                                 okay so that's something brave rit                                 hasn't been shared with anybody it's                                 just a                                 in-house seed of a project um and that                                 one i think                                 is going to be much much easier and                                 we're going to be get some traction um                                 quite quickly on that                                 so so the mission i was came in on is                                 one                                 ip clearance make sure that we have the                                 ip rights                                 to be able to free this you know old                                 code where it comes from                                 and this new code and who owns it that                                 was the easy bit in in legal terms                                 but the second half was and how do we                                 free it                                 i would say properly but but at least                                 in a manner that we can guarantee or get                                 the benefits of open source                                 and not just have to throw more money                                 more money more money at the code                                 from us as owners of code and just hope                                 that somewhere out there someone will                                 use it and maybe give us something back                                 okay so it's concept of building                                 community um but a little bit top down                                 because the code's there it's been                                 seeded it's been put out there                                 we've got some collaborators but we have                                 we haven't really built any community                                 dynamics                                 okay so it's quite difficult to kick                                 start or cold start                                 community dynamics when we don't really                                 have those                                 um community dynamics yet okay andy do                                 you want to go                                 um next okay so so the issues are here                                 and this is why i'm stopping handing                                 over to issues                                 is is that the status of what we looked                                 at okay                                 so we had two different projects we need                                 to look at them both in a very different                                 manner                                 so there's no one-size-fits-all that's                                 right that's an important first learning                                 um well everybody agreed that we don't                                 need to set up a foundation and an                                 institute                                 a public body i mean not another public                                 body please                                 there are loads of umbrella                                 organizations like the the region                                 government there are                                 inter-administrative                                 i.t support bodies which help as well so                                 there's                                 there's actually an entity set up here                                 in catalonia whose mission                                 is to provide i.t support and                                 centralized i.t                                 uh digital transformation for the small                                 municipalities who cannot afford it                                 okay so there's loads of if we need it                                 in the body that there it could be there                                 but in the end we said well we're doing                                 this ourselves at the moment so let's do                                 it ourselves and see how we can go there                                 so nobody okay no no no okay                                 on the ip front um once we've done the                                 clearance um it was important to say                                 keep it simple keep it clean let's not                                 have complications with special                                 agreements with special parties and                                 this is your code my code no let's                                 really try and adopt an open source                                 uh uh method here where they're like                                 a part of what's called a social                                 contract is that if you're going to                                 contribute you contribute under this                                 license                                 um a uk you know you the other cities                                 retain ownership                                 and the right ip rights but you use the                                 like the the project license                                 okay and um i think the final point is                                 is                                 goes together is the management and the                                 sustainability                                 is um although the public sector is                                 it may not seem to be very much an                                 economic entity because they've got                                 money public money in fact they are                                 they they are very very um close to                                 their money because they have very                                 little                                 amounts of money at least in spain we                                 have very little amounts of money                                 in the public sector and it has to be                                 very very carefully                                 uh managed that there is there's a value                                 for money type of deal in going open                                 source                                 is that we get more out of this than                                 we're going to have to put in                                 um so how can we set                                 up so that we've got this win-win for                                 everybody you know                                 the the the stanfield obviously had put                                 the most in at the moment because they                                 had invested in the building                                 so for everybody else it was it was an                                 easy one you know we've got code thanks                                 very much                                 you know open source code we can use it                                 the important thing is getting a dynamic                                 so that actually those people give back                                 and and and the costs are shared okay um                                 in in in in in the evolution and that                                 was very important in in terms of                                 the political decision of case we go                                 open source it's not going to be a                                 burden for us                                 it's going to be a win and how do we set                                 up the structures for the win                                 okay so that that's that was basically                                 the the the                                 the challenge is is from these old                                 projects well the                                 i think the arm project is going to be                                 very easy sorry historically everything                                 got to stop because on the                                                                                                       covered in spain we had lockdown so                                 nothing really happened after that and                                 all the it departments got really busy                                 um setting up people from home okay so                                 these had a one year refreeze since the                                 last thing okay                                 so that's where we are um and over to                                 you andrew just to compare how                                 what happened in cordon yeah super um                                 okay so this is uh just some of the                                 councils that are involved um let's say                                 this we're up to about                                                                                                         being driven by um croydon and brighton                                 um and then bracknell forest and oxford                                 are also involved and then there's other                                 councils involved um further along                                 along the line um and also a couple of                                 agencies in their dxw and                                 agile collective um who are sort of both                                 helping on the technical side of things                                 so how did this start well there was a                                                                    um thousand pound local government award                                 um which was available to councils that                                 wanted to try to do innovative things                                 in digital and this was applied for uh                                 towards the end                                 of                                                          um croydon and three other councils                                 won the award and they started this                                 project and the first thing to do is                                 really they wanted to work out                                 how to share code for their websites and                                 they're all using drupal so                                 um you know this seemed to be a sort of                                 pretty simple sort of lightweight proof                                 of concept to see how                                 this might work so they went into a                                 discovery phase asking other councils                                 what they were doing                                 um and trying to find out the                                 differences between the councils what                                 particular characteristics                                 um they had what their approaches might                                 be um you know what their blockers are                                 and we'll talk about those                                 um a little bit later and then as a                                 result of that they decided to form                                 a coding club um and                                 it was really all about sharing code                                 what they didn't want to do is to set up                                 an organization that was going to                                 provide you know                                 local government website services um as                                 a service                                 um it was it was very much at the                                 developer end of things                                 trying to work out how to share code to                                 make everything operate more efficiently                                 and they basically as you know in                                 parallel with some of the criteria that                                 malcolm was talking about they really                                 wanted it to be as lightweight                                 um and simple as possible so first of                                 all they went into                                 a discovery phase um and this is example                                 of                                 remember the days when people used to                                 sit around tables and talk to each other                                 well                                 we managed that for about two weeks                                 before we got locked down                                 uh but then because we were operating in                                 agile type fashion anyway most of these                                 people are developers so they're used to                                 operating in an agile fashion                                 um and actually from my personal                                 perspective it's the first time that                                 i've been embedded in a team that was                                 being managed in an agile fashion and i                                 it was a real                                 eye opener and the timing couldn't have                                 been better because when we went into                                 lockdown you know we transferred                                 a lot of that sort of activity using                                 tools like slack for example                                 um into the way that we run our business                                 as well anyway that's that's that's                                 another story                                 um so um                                 and as a result of the the discovery                                 phase                                 um you know we went through                                 these these um that we we discovered                                 these these uh particular                                 characteristics i'm not going to go into                                 them                                 um in in detail uh but obviously you                                 know councils have a lot of things in                                 common they continuously want to improve                                 their                                 their websites and and um even though                                 councils can vary                                 very differently in terms of the size                                 and the sort of populations they serve                                 some of them maybe in the countryside                                 some of them may be                                 um in urban areas uh there's still a lot                                 of things that they have to do                                 that that are in common so it seems like                                 a sort of a natural                                 fit for some sort of um some sort of                                 sharing                                 but part of the issue is that at                                 different levels within the council                                 um so different levels of management                                 management doesn't necessarily                                 quite get you know how code sharing                                 might operate they don't understand open                                 source they don't understand agile                                 methodology                                 um in the same way as you know all the                                 people that i was talking to and one of                                 the one of                                 the things that i found really                                 heartening was that i mean you know                                 these developers they really                                 understand agile they understand open                                 source                                 um they understand uh the licensing um                                 behind it                                 um and they realize that and we'll talk                                 about this a little bit later                                 um one of the challenges is really                                 trying to sell these ideas to management                                 further up                                 within the council so that they can they                                 can you know people at all levels can                                 can buy into the idea um but you know                                 fundamentally this was intended to be a                                 proof of concept and if it works the                                 idea and it has worked                                 and then the idea is to expand this into                                 into different areas as well                                 so in common with what malcolm was                                 saying we decided there was no need for                                 a formal incorporated body of                                 of any sort we thought we'd agree on on                                 a very                                 lightweight documentation so we have a                                 memorandum of understanding which is                                 only four pages long                                 we appreciate that licensing models are                                 complicated and we're not going to talk                                 about licensing now                                 in this particular case we just decided                                 to go for gpl because drupal is gpl and                                 everything you plug into jupiter                                 is probably going to be gpl as well so                                 you know don't think about it too hard                                 just go for gpl                                 and it needs to be and the concept needs                                 to be easy to sell                                 within the hierarchy of the council it                                 needs to be easy to sell                                 to the management um so                                 um i mean the the advantages which were                                 sort of obvious to us                                 and maybe not quite so so obvious to                                 management                                 um were things like you know we're not                                 reinventing the wheel um                                 so there's so so a piece of code can be                                 reused everywhere that's really the                                 the fundamental point behind this but it                                 means that                                 once this code has been shared there's                                 less lock-in because you're not tied to                                 one particular proprietary provider of a                                 platform                                 um but we figured out that it's still                                 possible for a commercial ecosystem to                                 develop i mean you have councils like                                 croydon who have the in-house capability                                 uh to be able to develop their own code                                 um but then you you have other councils                                 and these are some of the other councils                                 sort of                                 that are joining now you know who are                                 much smaller who maybe only have                                 you know a couple of people in their                                 tech department um and who aren't able                                 to do that so they're really going to                                 want to                                 um outsource but not necessarily to an                                 organization                                 that is just providing a one-stop                                 service they want to take advantage of                                 the cost savings etc that you get here                                 as well so                                 we believe that this sort of ecosystem                                 will develop in the future                                 and certainly the developers like                                 working in open source software they're                                 like agile methodologies                                 um they like the community et cetera et                                 cetera so that was a positive for us as                                 well                                 um we've got some figures on cost saving                                 which if we've got time i'll share with                                 you but you know                                 there's a perception in cost saving the                                 reason as an exclamation mark is that                                 a lot of people are trying to say um                                 open source isn't about cost saving it's                                 more about other advantages as well but                                 for councils where you're talking about                                 public money you know cost saving                                 is important and speed of deployment you                                 know you can you can roll that out                                 quickly as well                                 uh malcolm i don't know whether you know                                 that your your um your the                                 discussions that you had with your                                 projects have had a sort of similar list                                 yeah uh next sorry great so                                 you asked something uh yeah sure and i                                 was just wondering whether whether those                                 um sort of perceived advantages were                                 similar to the disadvantages that you                                 received as well                                 very much so except that don't forget                                 that in our in our case um                                 we had very few developers because the                                 developers are all outsourced so the                                 people who are managing this actually                                 were the project managers                                 who are the you know and systems of the                                 systems admin um who are in the in the                                 um                                 uh administration and and then the the                                 political levels                                 and the legal department so it was a                                 very much more top-down approach in that                                 sense                                 and the actual people to building it the                                 the developers                                 were not so keen because they were                                 coming from a private company and they                                 had this specific leverage they had for                                 their code                                 but the code was owned by the by the um                                 public administration so they had no say                                 in that in                                 that matter um but but but yes the the                                 the                                 those arguments the less lock in the                                 cost savings uh were all seen as as                                 big arguments in favor of of freeing                                 this and building the community yes                                 yeah great um and um you know and we                                 were concerned there were some                                 possible problems as as well and i'm not                                 going to go into these in depth but                                 um you know there is a perception that                                 um the open source software                                 um isn't necessarily as turnkey ready as                                 proprietary software is                                 and also because you're not necessarily                                 dealing with a commercial organization                                 um it means that you you know the legal                                 department gets a bit uncomfortable                                 about it so possible blockers are what                                 the legal department's going to say                                 what management is going to say so he's                                 trying to present everything in a way                                 um that basically said this is going to                                 be as low friction as possible                                 um it's just a proof of concept at the                                 moment if it doesn't work it's not going                                 to be                                 a big you will just learn something but                                 it's not we've not committed ourselves                                 to something huge                                 and i think that was something that made                                 it a lot easier                                 um for for organizations to to other                                 councils to get involved as well                                 yeah yeah i i i hear the pain in fact in                                 one of these when it's the perception                                 that you have to do more yourself                                 um because um obviously the the the                                 council that was just running its own                                 software passes from running its own                                 software and managing an open source                                 community                                 um yeah because obviously the the                                 council was going to be the leader                                 at least for the first stage of the                                 community committing resources to                                 building the community                                 and and uh they said well we've hardly                                 got the bandwidth today to run our                                 systems how we're going to find the time                                 and the money and the staff                                 and the skills because obviously running                                 a community is very different from                                 running an open source                                 running a project you know a public                                 public sector project                                 so so that was probably one of the                                 biggest tasks is saying how can we do                                 this                                 so that um we we get time                                 uh freed up so that we can actually                                 build community                                 run some events do some mailings do                                 everything else that happens in the                                 community                                 yeah okay okay so looking governance                                 here                                 um the the so this is this is as i say                                 work in progress because things                                 will put a little bit on hold um similar                                 a little bit to the mou that                                 uh member of understanding yeah that                                 that uh andy mentioned                                 um what what the spanish                                 public system works on the basis of                                 agreements and                                 and formal documents and this is                                 something that uh                                 if if you want to dedicate staff                                 resources money                                 to a project there has to be some form                                 of cover                                 legal contractual administrative cover                                 for this a project to set up for this                                 okay if you want to collaborate although                                 the law actually says you don't have                                 need to have an agreement                                 the way they've collaborated for the                                 last                                              through agreements so um just just                                 getting this through the legal                                 department was                                 easier if we said you know let's do an                                 umbrella agreement very much in line                                 with                                 andy's mou but much more detailed                                 because it's                                 public sector you've got three or four                                 lawyers looking at it and they all                                 want to add in their own little bit of                                 redlining okay but the the the content                                 of this which is a draft it's on the                                 table being discussed                                 is is what andy's probably gonna mention                                 actually in his um                                 mou is question of who we are what we're                                 doing um how to join this how to join                                 the boat how to come and leave                                 what commitments can be made um and and                                 we can talk a little bit more about that                                 if there's a binding commitment to say                                 well if you're joining look put up                                       you know euros                                 um and that goes into a pool and that                                 money will be used for                                 the backlog and the top priorities in                                 the next iteration of the project                                 um at the moment it's easier to sign an                                 administrative agreement if there's no                                 money involved so the moment there's                                 nothing there's no provision                                 for economics but there is provision                                 which more important for governance to                                 see how that works                                 okay so setting up some committees uh                                 in terms of who who's the project owner                                 uh user committee technical committee                                 um it it's heavyweight uh if anybody                                 looking at it you seem to be                                 jump starting a tiny project to                                 something like apache                                 apache castle but that's the way the                                 public administration works here and                                 they understand committees                                 they can actually work with committees                                 they have minutes things happen                                 once you've got the minutes and the                                 agenda and everything                                 i don't think the projects we're working                                 in would work on                                 on how andy's this kind of like informal                                 code sharing                                 is not in the culture of the                                 administration it's in the culture of                                 the                                 of the developers who are actually doing                                 it but it's not in the culture of the                                 the people who are pushing a little bit                                 more top down this project                                 okay and then the other thing is setting                                 up the community tools so github offers                                 a lot                                 but there's more than that so so                                 identifying                                 what was the community dynamics and how                                 to get people on board for that                                 um that was important and brain                                      very much uh                                 very very simple mapping a private                                 sector project just put on github                                 let's get some talks let's have some jam                                 sessions hack fest                                 a meet up or whatever um there's no                                 urgent priority                                 uh to get that working well there is now                                 but in terms of                                 technology but um so the more important                                 i think more interesting is                                 is the other one is the gd matrix and                                 how that was looked at                                 how does that compare with you andy um                                 yeah i think um it's really in                                 in terms of the ability for these                                 organizations to be able to operate on                                 an informal basis um and as you said we                                 had some memorandum                                 of understanding this is only four pages                                 long and there's a link to it if you                                 want to have a look at it later                                 um but um there's a list here of the                                 sort of the headings that that we                                 covered uh the most important                                 um words in the whole thing are at the                                 bottom in red this agreement is                                 non-binary                                 so that basically gave people an excuse                                 not to show this thing to their legal                                 departments                                 which so there's a sort of culture of                                 sort of you know ask for forgiveness                                 rather than permission just go ahead and                                 do something                                 and then and then if you if somebody                                 tells you off then you say i'm sorry i                                 really                                 shouldn't have done that uh so this was                                 the idea was that uh                                 this this really was the sort of most                                 most lightweight um                                 possible uh way of of arranging                                 this relationship um and so the the                                 final                                 um i'm not going to go through these                                 categories the last one is finance i                                 mean there's nothing in there about                                 finance nobody has to make any financial                                 commitment                                 and as soon as you've got a situation                                 where you don't have to have any budget                                 sign off then suddenly it becomes a lot                                 more straightforward                                 um so it was sort of semi-done under the                                 radar                                 um and the more successful the project                                 became the more that people admitted                                 that they were actually being involved                                 in it                                 so it was based on a set of values this                                 is actually part of the mou but it's                                 also based on something called the local                                 digital declaration                                 which is um something that has been uh                                 that a lot of um local authorities and                                 and um other government entities have                                 signed up to                                 um it it's it's very much a sort of open                                 source methodology list of list of the                                 sort of values that that you would                                 um apply um and some                                 you know people said very nice things                                 about the memorandum of understanding                                 um so where are we with this now um well                                 it was deployed in december                                 we reckon that all of the councils                                 involved                                 on the average of five microsites are                                 going to save something like you know                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         could save millions of pounds                                 really by using using this sort of                                 structure um                                 and uh and this is an example of the                                 just one of the websites that's using it                                 at the moment so the sort of thing that                                 you need to do if you interact with your                                 council                                 you need to pay for things um you you                                 know like                                 uh you might have to pay your taxes um                                 you might have to find                                 things like where you can find a                                 recycling bank or where you can find a                                 library or something                                 uh you might have to apply for various                                 permits and things and then if there are                                 problems like potholes in the road you                                 need                                 a mechanism for um for reporting them                                 um so i'm very conscious that we're                                 running very very short of time here                                 um so malcolm i don't know if there's                                 anything you want to talk about yeah                                 one final point five final points i                                 think we've only got we've only got a                                 couple of minutes                                 um i think i think there's been there's                                 a major difference between what you've                                 you've talked about and what i've talked                                 about                                 in terms of you're very much bottom up                                 build the team uh and and they just say                                 us                                 ask for forgiveness um mine's top down                                 because it's been driven from the top                                 uh and in fact i haven't you know kind                                 of it's a pity that we couldn't also do                                 both                                 and get the developers together and have                                 some you know pizza parties and                                 and get people interested through the                                 bottom i think that would definitely the                                 root next time                                 um i think the pros and cons of both but                                 both methods um and and as is from our                                 side i think                                 the the the formal justification of of                                 getting                                 freeing this is is is important that's                                 why i think we formalized it a bit more                                 than what you're saying um but again                                 it's embedded in our culture here and                                 that's that'll be very different in                                 france german italy                                 whatever i imagine so and and regionally                                 so and the other thing is we do have the                                 benefit of barcelona i mean barcelona is                                  really a driving                                  force for open source in in the area and                                  and and
