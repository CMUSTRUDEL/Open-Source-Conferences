Publication date: 2021-02-23
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	An important prerequisite for open source projects, software or community is proper documentation which includes a contributing guideline to encourage contributors to participate. Most times, beginners struggle with these contributing guidelines mainly because they are too technical to comprehend. This has become an obstacle for most beginners who are looking into contributing to Open Source.

This session will be  focused on;

- Problems With most contribution guidelines
- My experience as a beginner
- The need for inclusiveness in contribution guidelines
- Impact of detailed contribution guidelines to a project

open source and also cad                               lover and these are my                               accounts in case you want to connect                               always ready much                               available and today i will be speaking                               on the topic inclusive contribution                                to inclusive contribution guidelines for                                open source                                projects and first and foremost                                what are contribution guidelines                                and i define it as um a text file                                that is created by project maintenance                                that contains                                guidelines on them on how people and new                                contributors should                                contribute to that particular project                                the do's and don'ts on how they're                                supposed to like                                successfully carry on a pull request by                                the end of the day                                yes so but they're a couple of problems                                that i noticed from my period                                of um contributing to open source from                                last year i was up to this point                                but from a beginner perspective i                                noticed a few mistakes that um                                always happen in open source project on                                them                                and some of these common contribution                                guidelines                                problems are one it's always too                                technical                                so technically different in the sense                                that                                let's not forget that the contribution                                guideline is supposed to give                                us the detailed breakdown of our                                particular project and how to set up                                the project and this guidelines are set                                out there for new contributors and the                                people who are contributing to the                                project for for the first time right                                so if it happens to be too technical                                in the sense that there's so many                                technical terms and uh                                as in newbie i just heard about open                                source and i come on                                and i say okay let me try making a cool                                request for the first time since i've                                been given                                i've heard a lot about open source and                                then i see                                the documentation contribution                                guidelines are like too technical                                i don't know the terms there how do i                                understand what this project is about                                and                                there's this general idea that will come                                to my mind as a new contributor this                                project is not for you it is for                                somebody that has close to                                four to five years experience because                                this kind of terms i don't think                                a new being with very little                                um expertise like me would be able to                                contribute to this particular                                project and um another problem                                is um there's not enough details                                yes documentations are like have like                                so much writing you have to do this you                                have to do that but it doesn't contain                                like the major                                details that actually put somebody                                through does he have                                the step to step guidelines okay                                you have to make a pull request go to                                this point click on this button                                do these okay how to set up the                                dependencies you have to do this                                particular thing                                okay this project needs this particular                                framework to                                run on your particular system does it                                have this                                guidelines that are already there or is                                there an assumption that                                a contribution should be aware that yeah                                this project is this particular                                framework under                                she just hop on it it's one of the                                problems i noticed and um                                another problem is uh not usually                                interactive                                a lot of persons have difficulties                                learning with just documentation                                and if you're putting up a guideline                                 a step-by-step demo on how to set up a                                 particular project on my own                                 device at least it should have like                                 a demo or a short video or maybe                                 an audio recording that i could like                                 listen to or watch                                 and see how it is done that way it is me                                 the stress but                                 i've not actually come across any                                 contribution guidelines that                                 are usually disinteractive and there are                                 very few open source projects that                                 actually make contribution guidelines                                 interactive                                 and it's difficult to assess                                 it is a contribution guideline let                                 us not forget and it is supposed to be                                 the main                                 thing that a new contributor sees once                                 it comes                                 onto that repository                                 six four pages looking for contribution                                 guidelines and                                 asking questions for from every team                                 member just to                                 just know where i can find the                                 contribution guidelines                                 do's and don'ts and a particular guy um                                 contribution guidelines and then                                 it is always hard to read                                 hard to read in the sense that like it                                 is so                                 conjected with information that you                                 always miss the                                 the very particular points that you are                                 supposed to                                 take note of like                                 there's so many informations i know that                                 these things are very important                                 but then the vital information is like                                 if you don't                                 install this particular framework then                                 this project cannot run on your system                                 or if you don't have this particular                                 software on your system then this                                 project is not going to run from your                                 own end                                 these are things that should be stated                                 out there like because they're very                                 important i mean everybody should                                 know that yeah these are key points if i                                 don't do this then my project will not                                 work uh                                 yeah and um yes i'd like to share my                                 experience as                                 a beginner so as i said i started um                                 contributing to open source sometime                                 august                                 and uh as a first time contributor i                                 think i was like                                 just four months into um web development                                 as a whole                                 so i i was eager to contribute because                                 i i always see people post on twitter ah

       should give it a try also                                 and then i came up across an open source                                 project                                 the issue the issue was a very minor                                 issue                                 like it's a so just a documentation but                                 i had to like                                 do a translation now for us                                 for a person who is like new to open                                 source                                 and programming as a whole i didn't                                 understand like a lot of                                 technical terms and i was reading                                 through the readme because                                 i contacted somebody from the project                                 and i'm like okay i want to go about                                 this symbol i can't actually                                 figure out my way around and this is my                                 first time                                 and they said i should check the readme                                 and the documentation everything is                                 there in the documentation                                 yes i've gone through the documentations                                 and i'm not seeing the important key                                 points                                 what problem am i fixing and i'm trying                                 to                                 get this thing i don't know i don't i                                 didn't even know how to set up how to                                  the repository or clone it i didn't                                 know how to do                                 none of that it took me approximately                                 two weeks                                 to fix that

frustrated with the                                 whole                                 running about contacted different                                 persons and because i didn't know how                                 else to explain my situation                                 to somebody like okay this challenge i'm                                 i'm facing and                                 because of this particular thing i've                                 not been able to contribute my full                                 request is not going to                                 i didn't know how to explain it to                                 somebody like technical terms i know                                 even if i try to explain to somebody                                 they're like just check the                                 documentation it should be there every                                 open source project has documentation                                 that has everything written there but i                                 couldn't just navigate around it                                 and that was a big problem for me i i                                 ended up not fixing the issues assigned                                 to somebody else                                 but a few weeks after                                 i was able to like go over other                                 projects and i saw                                 the whole process of how to how to                                 clone and then                                 make your changes sound and push back to                                 the repository and                                 i i realized that the issue i was                                 actually                                 breaking heads for was just something i                                 would have done in a few minutes but                                 because of a tiny                                 mistake i kept having issues and this                                 was another thing that gave me big-time                                 issues                                 i i was so frustrated but um                                 that is my short story and i'm coming                                 from a view of                                 a first-time contributor i think                                 you understand how it feels when you                                 come to a repository and                                 you're lost you don't know how to go                                 about the contribution guideline had not                                 clearly                                 stated out on telling what to do with                                 what not to do                                 which step you should take the next and                                 um                                 that is just my story and                                 yes um why should we improve                                 contribution guidelines                                 and because um the first time                                 contributors                                 can be a code maintainer tomorrow now                                 open source is based on um contributors                                 yeah                                 and so the contributor should be like                                 the key factor and if                                 i come into a project as a contributor                                 and um i'm not                                 able to find my way around                                 i would definitely abandon that project                                 i would want to go there again because                                 i'm like ah                                 that project i would have loved to                                 contribute to it but assistants                                 i don't really understand the kind of                                 terms they're using                                 i don't understand how the processes are                                 done this i actually get confused in                                 this particular project so i think i                                 would just keep                                 well that's the way i would put it                                 because i wouldn't want to go through                                 the stress i went on the first day                                 for any project again and i wouldn't                                 want anybody to experience that i'm sure                                 that's how                                 a new beginner would feel if he doesn't                                 get um                                 the right contribution guidelines and                                 another way is to                                 make a welcoming environment                                 make it if we have                                 stated our construction guidelines it                                 makes the                                 the contributors to feel like yeah this                                 this project feels like it's actually                                 convenient for me to be here if i                                 they feel like they actually understand                                 that i am new i feel like                                 that's not that i am with this project                                 and i need proper guidelines i mean if                                 somebody can actually take                                 out their time and document how to                                 go about contributing as                                 step to step as this then i mean                                 they care about the contributors and i                                 always i always want to stick around a                                 particular project                                 and then yes another reason is for sake                                 of references                                 if i wanted about me as a contributor if                                 i                                 see an issue in a particular project and                                 then fixing it was not so difficult i                                 always refer somebody and i'm like                                 yes if you want to contribute to open                                 source this project is the best it                                 is the right place for you because                                 they're welcoming                                 and everything is very friendly for                                 beginners so if you're a beginner you're                                 looking for open source project                                 then you should start here and um i                                 don't think it's only for me                                 i i mean there are lots of persons that                                 will actually do that reference and                                 super six of references                                 and the contribution guidelines should                                 be properly                                 documented and um                                 how can we achieve an inclusive                                 contribution                                 guideline                                 yeah the first step i put out                                 to help in achieving a proper                                 construction guidelines is to translate                                 documentation into various languages                                 some time ago i was contributing to a                                 particular open source project i was                                 doing                                 a hacktoberfest and i had this issue and                                 it says translated german                                 and for a moment i stopped to ask myself                                 why are they translating their                                 contribution guidelines                                 to german i mean they should know that                                 everybody                                 across the world is going to have access                                 to this particular                                 repository and we want to go over the                                 contribution guidelines but then what's                                 their main reason so i asked them                                 the person which are the maintainer of                                 that particular project and the reasons                                 i got                                 made sense to an expert they said most                                 of their contributors are like                                 german so they have to make a confident                                 environment for them to                                 contribute like so it won't be so                                 difficult you have to translate to                                 german before you actually understand                                 what they're contributing to                                 but they seem to forget that i'm not                                 german                                 and i'm sure other people too they're                                 not german                                 there's so many people that are not                                 actually german right now and we're                                 coming to this particular project it's                                 hard to buffer us everyone is eager to                                 fix an                                 issue but what are people who are not                                 actually german                                 and if um the documentation is                                 translated into                                 various languages or there is a way to                                 get                                 translations into any language of a                                 choice depending on where the                                 contributor is actually based or coming                                 from                                 then it will make a lot of times                                 another one isn't make tutorials on                                 project setup                                 sorry yeah                                 every open source project if you ask me                                 you should consider including                                 screencasts and um recordings and um                                 short videos on how to actually                                 contribute to                                 a particular project set up like in                                 particular organization there should be                                 somebody                                 one of the code maintainers who are like                                 very grounded in that particular thing                                 what will be willing to do                                 a step-by-step guide on how to get along                                 on that particular project on the setup                                 and how to                                 finally arrive with a good crew request                                 i could                                 mesh immediately and this would really                                 be helpful to a contributor because                                 a lot of persons who actually relate                                 better                                 with um videos and the demos than just                                 reading through documentation and                                 because definitely you miss a point and                                 at that point when you miss a point how                                 do you                                 how do you reframe yourself how do you                                 go back                                 to the point that you actually made a                                 mistake if you're not like                                 very aware of what you're doing                                 another way that i would to                                 improve contribution guidelines avoid                                 too many technical terms                                 let us get in mind that we are looking                                 for new contributors or even                                 contributors to that particular                                 repository                                 that are not very grounded on that                                 particular thing and                                 if the documentation and the                                 contribution guidelines are                                 so technical for someone with basic                                 knowledge about open source or                                 open source projects at all to                                 understand it's very difficult for                                 contributors to actually meet make                                 attempts                                 on how to like contribute to that                                 particular project                                 so the technical terms we made very                                 friendly and um                                 broken down into like very very basic                                 terms that                                 anybody even somebody who has like the                                 least knowledge about open source could                                 read about a particular                                 contribution guideline and set up a                                 particular project                                 without having to google each term                                 after each line you read                                 this will really save a lot of um                                 headaches for                                 new contributors and um                                 another point i wrote artisan to make                                 contribution guidelines                                 obvious it is a contribution guidelines                                 can can it just be like the first thing                                 i see                                 when i come into a project because                                 i wouldn't want to start looking for                                 where to                                 to see a contribution guy like the way i                                 did in my own time going from page to                                 page                                 asking questions on from one member to                                 the other how can you do this can you                                 schedule meeting less                                 so that you can show me how to go about                                 the contribution                                 i mean it should be very obvious and                                 read me that yes contribution guidelines                                 i hear for                                 somebody who is new to this particular                                 project and                                 another is um we should build a bridge                                 and by building a bridge i mean we                                 should um                                 we should set up a code of conduct for                                 members of the community                                 this is because yes                                 everyone has like self-control                                 but not all the time the times when you                                 get very furious either by                                 a particular events that trigger the                                 anger or                                 another one and then you when you plan a                                 review or anything                                 as a member of community might it might                                 just be harsh to the next person                                 without even knowing it and this always                                 goes on                                 i mean we're humans and it's very easy                                 for us to flare up at any point in time                                 but if we build a bridge and um setting                                 up code of conduct                                 then people will always have them to                                 instill a sense of                                 proper behavioral attitude for each                                 member                                 such that they have the same they                                 actually                                 reply to the underrepresented members of                                 the community                                 as um in the most friendly way when it                                 comes to                                 and using some powers                                 or hash words towards people when they                                 ask questions                                 would they will be avoided                                 and um another is to ensure that the                                 guidelines                                 contain complete information is there                                 any detail that is left hanging from                                 that particular contribution guideline                                 i mean you should have from the first                                 step of um                                 coming into the repository down to the                                 point where the pull request is meshed                                 and then                                 you're sent the congratulations your                                 pure request has been meshed                                 this step-by-step guide should be                                 documented in the contribution                                 guidelines so that                                 even if i i have very little basic                                 knowledge about contributing to open                                 source                                 i will be able to um follow the                                 guidelines                                 and then complete the whole contribution                                 process                                 without having any issues                                 and um if                                 if in case where like there are other                                 issues like                                 which particular code what i contribute                                 is the code ways or                                 is it um documentation or is it certain                                 design                                 then all this the information should be                                 stated                                 in the contribution guidelines

know what else to                                 do you don't know which net which step                                 to go next                                 then the contribution guidelines should                                 um                                 specify that yes in case                                 of conclusion or if you get lost                                 then you can reach out to this person or                                 contact this person                                 for assistance you get                                 this would help

   these you mentioned interactivity so                                 being able to like watch a video which                                 you know i'm a very visual learner so i                                 appreciate that as well                                 i'm wondering if interactive help are                                 there channels that you have found to be                                 particularly useful whether it's getter                                 or irc or slack or whatever                                 um like means to interact with people in                                 that way have you found some to be                                 better than others                                 yes um slack is friendly like slack is                                 it's a way to interact with your                                 contributors but                                 um interactiveness what i actually meant                                 in that                                 aspect was um creating demos and um                                 videos that are like maybe youtube                                 videos it could be like two minutes or                                 three minutes it doesn't matter the                                 length so long as it gives                                 every step by step details that you                                 could actually use                                 like get started in that particular                                 project i'm sure every contributor would                                 really appreciate the time taken out to                                 make                                 that project and it's really helped                                 people                                 to go a long way because their videos                                 and everyone can                                 actually refer to them at any point in                                 time                                 if they're having challenges so does um                                 interactiveness i was talking                                 about that sounds great i know                                 one thing that was mentioned and                                 something that i've definitely felt as                                 well as your idea of                                 not too much technical jargon or at                                 least being able to explain it so people                                 understand if you're working in a                                 project what does a particular term                                 mean for a project i i have had to                                 google                                 several times i've had to google like a                                 a sentence where to work just to make                                 sure i understand that                                 yeah this is what this this time you're                                 talking about and                                 it gets funny sometimes but it helps                                 with the vocabulary but then                                 it gets stressful sometimes you don't                                 have to do everything                                 it's made easy i think this is a great                                 list                                 so anita thank you so much for your talk                                 appreciate it i think the audience uh                                 took a lot out of it and definitely have                                 some some work to do on their own                                 contribution guidelines                                 so thank you for that                                 you
