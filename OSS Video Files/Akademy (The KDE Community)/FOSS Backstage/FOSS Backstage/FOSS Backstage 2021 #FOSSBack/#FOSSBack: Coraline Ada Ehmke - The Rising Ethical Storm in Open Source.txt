             he wasn't allowed to see what was inside                                of it the stranger blindfolded him again                                as soon as the lock clicked open but                                true to his word                                the stranger made the locksmith                                exceedingly rich                                we're going to come back to this parable                                and find out what happened when the safe                                was opened in just a few minutes                                this is an hp laserjet one of the first                                laser printers                                it came out in                                                       man named richard stallman was working                                in an ai lab at xerox                                the lab acquired one of these printers                                it was cutting edge technology                                but it constantly jammed the lab had                                time sharing software so you had to book                                 time for                                 various resources including a printer                                 but if you set aside and book                                            for printing                                 only to discover that it jammed five                                 minutes in you'd be upset                                 so stallman and his co-workers decided                                 to change the printer driver so that it                                 would                                 report jams back to the time sharing                                 software and users could be notified                                 but the software was proprietary and hp                                 wouldn't                                 share the source code stallman found out                                 that a colleague at mit                                 had the source code but that person had                                 sent a non-disclosure agreement and                                 couldn't                                 share it solomon got really angry not                                 just about the printer                                 but about the fact that the world was                                 shifting toward proprietary software                                 and this incident with a printer would                                 lead to the creation                                 of the free software movement                                 in the mid to late

                     the fundamental question seems to be are                                 we                                 responsible for how the technologies we                                 develop                                 are used and a lot of us are beginning                                 to accept that our work in open source                                 might be contributing to harm and                                 atrocities                                 in the u.s and around the world                                 in response to these questions we're                                 seeing increased interest in ethical                                 open source licenses                                 including the hippocratic license which

                 right thing                                 we're horrified by what's happening in                                 the world and we're horrified at the                                 thought                                 that we may be contributing to it                                 today we have much bigger ethical                                 problems than proprietary software                                 stallman wanted a printer driver we want                                 to ensure that our work is not used for                                 human rights abuses that's what's work                                 that's what we're fighting for                                 but the conversation about ethics and                                 computer science is not new                                 it's been happening in our field since                                 there was even any such thing as                                 software                                 i want to introduce you to a man named                                 edmund berkeley he was one of the most                                 important pioneers of ethics and                                 computer science                                 in the                                                                knows who he is                                 you got to start working on computers                                 with the navy during world war                                 ii and worked alongside admiral grace                                 hopper                                 he probably showed world's first                                 computer magazine and was among the                                 first people to propose the idea                                 of a personal computer                                 berkeley co-founded the association for                                 computing machinery                                 at columbia university in                                      and the organization's charter is to                                 foster the open                                 interchange of information and promote                                 the highest                                 professional and ethical standards                                 berkeley settled on the committee on the                                 social responsibility of computer                                 scientists                                 which published an historic and                                 foundational report in                                      on the ethical obligations of                                 technologists                                 the findings of the report boil down                                 into four simple statements                                 first that we cannot rightly ignore our                                 social responsibilities                                 secondly that our social                                 responsibilities can't be delegated to                                 others                                 third we cannot rightly neglect to think                                 about how                                 our special role can benefit or harm                                 society                                 in other words we must consider how our                                 special capabilities                                 can help to advance socially desirable                                 applications                                 and prevent undesirable outcomes                                 and finally we cannot avoid deciding                                 between conflicting responsibilities                                 we must think how to choose                                 the report went on to say that when one                                 reflects upon the                                 great forces that computer people are                                 associated with                                 it's no longer difficult to grasp or                                 even to accept our heavier than average                                 share of responsibility                                 the committee believed that given the                                 power and potential of computers                                 ethical considerations were paramount                                 the committee concluded the scientist                                 credo knowledge for knowledge's sake                                 comes into conflict with our ethical                                 responsibilities                                 given human society in our century and                                 the ethical value system we're using in                                 our century                                 we can label some classes of work as                                 obviously socially desirable                                 and other classes of work as obviously                                 socially                                 undesirable even acknowledging that                                 there's a large middle ground                                 which cannot be clearly classified                                 and it was berkeley who wrote the                                 parable of the locksmith                                 and remember it was the height of the                                 cold war when he wrote it                                 the parable ends with this                                 a week later the retired locksmith saw a                                 news headline                                 about the theft of top top secret                                 military schematics                                 and soon after that the stranger himself                                 appeared on the world stage                                 declaring himself master of all nations                                 backed by the overwhelming threat                                 of a devastating soul and superweapon                                 berkeley asked the question did the                                 locksmith do what was right                                 and he contended that the locksmith had                                 a responsibility                                 to determine whether the stranger was a                                 criminal before agreeing to work with                                 him so no                                 the locksmith did not do what was right                                 berkeley believed that the computer                                 scientist does not have the right to                                 shut their eyes                                 in regard to their responsibilities any                                 more than the locksmith has                                 and he called on his colleagues to                                 shoulder their proper social                                 responsibilities                                 and he was largely ignored                                 fast forward about a decade it's                                      and the vietnam war is raging berkeley                                 and his colleague franz alt had been                                 invited to address the acm                                 at a special dinner honoring them as                                 founders on its

                              of horizons while altz talk was                                 celebratory                                 providing a retrospective on the                                 advances of computer engineering                                 and computer science since world war ii                                 berkeley's speech took on a distinctly                                 different tone                                 he told the audience that anyone who is                                 working to further                                 unethical uses of

                      he called out members of the audience by                                 name                                 many of his colleagues were so upset by                                 his comments that they stood up and                                 walked out                                 in the middle of a speech and admiral                                 grace hopper was

gross neglect of                                 responsibility                                 that computer scientists were not                                 considering their impact

routinely rely on                                 open source software                                 to provide services to ice                                 how would we feel about the complicity                                 of ibm and the holocaust                                 if their plunge card system had been                                 released under the gpl                                 because that's exactly the situation                                 we're facing today                                 in

                       in intellectual property terms                                 in                                                                   than microsoft                                 we're in an age where governments are                                 carrying out programs of mass                                 surveillance                                 using facial

state-sanctioned genocide and violence                                 and open source software is being used                                 to power these human rights violations                                 in the u.s ice the immigration and                                 customs enforcement agency has been                                 separating children from their parents

role in human rights abuses                                 like these                                 so what does this have to do with open                                 source let's take a well-known example                                 palantir technology is a software                                 company co-founded by top trump advisor                                 peter thiel                                 collects millions of dollars tens of                                 millions of dollars from ice every year                                 at present palantir has                                                  hosted on github                                 which in turn rely on thousands of open                                 source dependencies                                 every dependency in use by palantir                                 contributes to human rights violations                                 i created a an application called                                 icebreaker                                 icebreaker.dev that tracks all of the                                 open source dependencies that volunteer                                 is using                                 thomas kuhn argues in his seminal book                                 the structure of scientific revelation                                 revolutions                                 that science has always practiced within                                 political contexts                                 scientists do not operate with complete                                 freedom they operate within community                                 and societal constraints                                 kuhn wrote that revolutions emerge when                                 there's a conflict                                 between an established paradigm and a                                 new paradigm                                 and we're seeing this play out in a                                 debate between open source                                 traditionalists and ethical source                                 advocates                                 so what can happen as a consequence of                                 this debate                                 what are the possible outcomes of the                                 conflict                                 it really depends on how the open source                                 establishment responds                                 the first possible response is                                 procrastination                                 in the face of an ethical crisis                                 procrastination is not an                                 option the need is too urgent                                 the second possible response is                                 assimilation                                 this happens when the establishment                                 accommodates a new idea                                 and adjusts to it in a conflict-free                                 manner and this is my ideal outcome                                 i want to give the open source community                                 the opportunity                                 to accommodate ethical considerations by                                 challenging the narrow perspectives of                                 freedom zero                                 and the open source definition and i                                 realize that's heretical                                 the most extreme result of the conflict                                 between the establishment and a new                                 paradigm                                 is revolution                                 kuhn describes revolutionaries as being                                 motivated                                 to solve a different problem than the                                 establishment has prioritized                                 the current debate is whether solving                                 the problem                                 of software freedom is more significant                                 than solving the problem                                 of human freedom                                 in                                                                       announced the united nations global                                 compact                                 it's an agreement to encourage                                 businesses to adopt sustainable and                                 socially responsible policies                                 it's the world's largest corporate                                 social responsibility initiative                                 with tens of thousands of participants                                 and stakeholders in hundreds of                                 countries                                 the very first section of the compact                                 deals with human rights and it states                                 that businesses should support and                                 respect the protection of                                 internationally proclaimed human rights                                 and that businesses must make sure that                                 they are not complicit                                 in human rights abuses complicity in                                 this                                 in the situ in this uh context has two                                 different modes                                 the first is directly providing goods or                                 services that a company knows                                 we use to carry out human rights abuses                                 like pound chair                                 the second is when a company benefits                                 from human rights abuses                                 even if it did not possibly assist or                                 cause them                                 and this is akin to the github situation                                 many large tech companies have been                                 happily profiting from human rights                                 abuses for years                                 and i've been calling for those who have                                 the safety and privilege to do so                                 to accept their ethical responsibilities                                 and either organize or change at these                                 companies                                 or quit their jobs this includes tech                                 workers at amazon                                 microsoft                                 github                                 salesforce                                 cisco                                 and deloitte and many                                 many others                                 asylum seekers suffer unimaginable                                 violence and torture violations of their                                 dignity safety and basic human rights                                 in government concentration camps across                                 the us                                 amazon microsoft github salesforce cisco                                 and dozens of other companies all                                 leverage open source technologies                                 to profit from human rights abuses and                                 according to the united nations                                 definition                                 these companies are all complicit                                 i believe that as technologists we have                                 a moral imperative                                 to prevent our work from being used to                                 harm others                                 responsibility is about impact not                                 intent                                 freedom for freedom's sake is                                 incompatible                                 with our responsibility to society                                 and as karen sandler from the software                                 freedom conservancy once said to me                                 software freedom must always be in                                 service of human freedom                                 and the point is the way that people                                 just like you react to the question of                                 ethics and open source                                 will determine the future of our                                 community you have the power                                 to influence what happens next                                 if you're in the procrastination camp                                 and think you can simply ignore                                 the debate you're in for a big                                 disappointment these issues are not                                 going away                                 and a growing body of developers                                 is speaking out against it                                 if you want peaceful revolution                                 resolution you're in the assimilation                                 camp                                 so you can work with traditionalist                                 foster organizations                                 to focus on some licensure and more on                                 promoting ethical standards                                 centering justice and equity in the                                 practice of open source                                 but if the community refuses to                                 acknowledge let alone work to address                                 the ethical shortcomings of free and                                 open                                 as it stands today then the only option                                 you leave us with                                 is revolution                                 a proprietary printer driver sparked a                                 massive paradigm shift in software                                 development                                 stallman saw what is he what he                                 perceived as an ethical problem                                 and created a brilliant way of solving                                 it with licensing and that's an                                 epic hack today we have much bigger                                 ethical problems than proprietary                                 software                                 and it's up to us to come up with                                 another epic hack                                 to solve that too stallman wanted a                                 printer driver                                 we want to prevent our work from being                                 used for human rights abuses and that's                                 what the revolution is about                                 we're all inspired by the promises of                                 free                                 and open but we also need to exp accept                                 responsibility                                 for impact and outcomes                                 because in the end we're all locksmiths                                 and the world is full                                 of mysterious strangers                                 if you want to join us in working

a really                                 interesting talk um there was a lot to                                 think                                 about there um we are now we have a few                                 minutes for                                 questions so if people want to ask                                 questions please uh write them in the                                 chat on the questions bar                                 um while we wait for those um                                 i have a question um i thought it was                                 really interesting that you brought up                                 the um point about thomas kuhn                                 um and how various kinds of scientific                                 research don't                                 take place in a vacuum they take place                                 in a wider society so they're not                                 free from the influences of wider                                 society                                 i wondered if you thought that um                                 [Music]                                 changes um the changes that you were                                 talking about                                 are they more likely to come from inside                                 the community or is it                                 pressure from outside the community uh                                 the wider public                                 that you think is going to lead to more                                 changes                                 um i think the wider public doesn't have                                 an                                 understanding of the technical linkages                                 between work that an individual or a                                 small group of contributors to                                 and how that gets magnified by an                                 organization like amazon or microsoft                                 so i don't think i don't think we can                                 rely on a public outcry                                 to encourage engineers to accept social                                 responsibilities i really think it has                                 to come from                                 inside and we're seeing it come from                                 inside the ethical source working group                                 is over                                                    as ethicists philosophers technologists                                 open source maintainers human rights                                 workers                                 academics lawyers there's a                                 large and growing community of people                                 who do take these problems very                                 seriously                                 and are working in a very creative                                 manner                                 to come up with different kinds of ways                                 of solving the problem                                 okay great um we have a question from                                 the audience and i'll just read this                                 so a few years ago at the chaos                                 communication congress                                 there was a call to build software in a                                 surveillance resistant                                 or resilient way do you think there is a                                 way to build ethics                                 not only into licenses but other things                                 too                                 i actually uh think licensing i realize                                 the ethical source movement is best                                 known                                 for having produced a hypocritical                                 license but our main focus is not on                                 licensure                                 and we think in fact that the open                                 source traditionalists focus on                                 licensure                                 is a shortcoming licensure is one tool                                 and the working group is developing                                 multiple tools                                 to address this problem                                 including uh you know you can really                                 think of it as ethics starting at home                                 in a lot of ways the way that we manage                                 and govern                                 our open source communities our codes of                                 conduct and how we enforce them                                 our governance and how transparent that                                 is all of those are really critical to                                 producing ethical software                                 and really it's about taking the time to                                 think about                                 outcomes to think about how your                                 software could be abused                                 if you think about it at the beginning                                 it's a lot easier to to your example to                                 design                                 for safety to design so that the tools                                 can't be easily abused                                 and we can't stop technology from being                                 used in an abusive way                                 but we can put up boundaries we can                                 create incentives for doing things the                                 right way                                 we can do a lot better
