Title: #FOSSBack: Leslie Hawthorn - Love in the Time of Corona: Parenting, Pandemic, and Professionalism
Publication date: 2021-02-23
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Adapting to the "new normal" of defaulting to working from home, while simultaneously providing care - or schooling - for children, elders and other family members, all whilst attempting to maintain our own career success and preserve our mental health in the face of enormous stressors has been -- well, let's be honest, it has been sucktastic. 

In this presentation, I will do some real talk about love during Coronazeit: love for our families, love for ourselves, and how to best show empathy to our colleagues who are somehow making it work under near-impossible circumstances. I will also discuss the disproportionate struggles of professional women during the pandemic, and how the increased demand for 'emotional labor' in these times has led to increased burnout, flight of women from the workforce, and limitations to women's future career growth opportunities. 

Audience members will leave with a greater understanding of small ways they can each provide better care to themselves and their communities. We are all in this together and can only prosper when we are committed to mutual support.

	                              good day                               everyone i'm really pleased to have you                               here joining me for this presentation                               here at frost backstage                               uh this is my third frost backstage                               obviously the first virtual one                               um i wanted to start                               my opening remarks by letting everyone                               in the audience know that one of the                                reasons why                                i felt particularly responsible                                for for bringing these messages to our                                community is i recognize my own enormous                                privilege                                in that uh you know i am uh i am a white                                well-educated woman                                working in the tech industry and                                therefore                                uh when i am facing the challenges of uh                                living in corona times                                and the stresses that that brings to all                                of us i'm doing so from uh from a place                                where                                my position is relatively safe and                                secure though though my life may be                                difficult and i wanted to give voice to                                some of the experiences that other folks                                are having who are not in a position to                                be able to critique the system or the                                uh the modality in which they operate                                because they do not have that same                                privilege themselves                                um just a couple quick words about                                myself um                                i am currently working as a manager in                                red hat's open source program office                                i've been working in the open source                                space for                                almost                                                                 just me sharing my own personal                                experiences                                as a parent in the times of corona this                                isn't any                                uh reflection of my uh employer's                                thoughts on the matter although                                i guarantee there will probably be a                                couple of love letters to uh to red hat                                during this talk just because i think                                that the way that they've handled                                working with their employees during the                                pandemic has been                                super so to get into the meat of our                                presentation for today                                um it should come as no surprise to                                anyone uh that we live in very tender                                times                                um life is very very difficult                                right now and it's not simply the global                                pandemic                                um even before we were all                                uh putting our lives on hold and                                adjusting to the new normal that is                                uh the coronavirus the uh the world was                                a very challenging place to live in                                to begin with right we had a global                                civil unrest                                including in places where i think many                                folks didn't expect to see civil unrest                                occurring such as in the united states                                where i'm originally from                                uh we had uh global trade wars                                escalating we were noticing the strains                                of uh the uh globalization impact and                                how that had stretched our supply chains                                and as we searched for economies of                                scale that left our ability to be                                resilient in times of crisis                                uh impaired and then so so that all sort                                of exploded and was brought together                                when um when in fact a moment of crisis                                challenged that overall resilience to                                our global systems                                and now here we are living uh you know                                through a global pandemic while                                in the meantime all the other sources we                                may have had of sort of existential                                angst or stress remain right we're all                                still wondering how we're going to                                provide well for ourselves and our                                families                                we are all still probably concerned                                about the impact of climate change                                on our futures uh the number of                                displaced persons worldwide continues to                                grow due to climate change                                um global conflict etc so                                it is not as though we are only                                experiencing the stress                                of our changed lives and the pandemic                                 life was already pretty stressful to                                 begin with                                 and now in our in our new normal and my                                 thesis is actually that we have reached                                 we have reached an almost impossible                                 challenge as individuals                                 in order to simply cope with the the                                 stresses of our daily life                                 and hopefully throughout the course of                                 this presentation in addition to                                 bringing to light some of those                                 challenges i will also be able to give

departure                                 um hopefully throughout the course of                                 this presentation in addition to                                 identifying some of the                                 challenges that many of us are facing                                 and helping to                                 create some empathetic uh interactions                                 around those challenges                                 we'll also talk about ways that we can                                 help build resilience in ourselves and                                 in our communities as we face this                                 nearly impossible challenge                                 so one of the goals that i have with                                 this talk is actually to make                                 to make the invisible visible and what i                                 mean by that is                                 um i think we've all read enough think                                 pieces about how                                 we have zoom fatigue and we are                                 exhausted by only meeting                                 folks on video and we don't have the                                 same sort of dopamine reaction                                 with uh video-based                                 communications as we do with in-person                                 interactions and how that is                                 is causing um a global level of                                 exhaustion in how we interact with one                                 another                                 i think we've all read uh the articles                                 talking about how                                 um there's been an increase in                                 uh job loss economic disturbance around                                 the virus etc                                 like we we have an understanding that                                 these things are going on but if they                                 don't                                 if these problems aren't necessarily                                 directly impacting us i don't think we                                 have a good sense of                                 what it means to have these these                                 particular experiences                                 and and one thing that has deeply rooted                                 in my own experience of living through                                 corona                                 was a talk i had very early on with a                                 good friend of mine about                                 the challenges that i was facing as a                                 parent and um how                                 how my time was bifurcated and it was                                 very hard to focus and                                 all the same things that many other                                 people are experiencing and                                 and her response was to say i think that                                 this is the first time that people                                 really understand what it's been like                                 for me my whole life living with a                                 disabled spouse                                 and that to me was extremely profound                                 right the                                 i had known this person for many many                                 years and i had known that they had a                                 disabled spouse and i was sympathetic to                                 that but i did not have any kind of                                 understanding of what that meant on a                                 day-to-day basis for that person's life                                 because i had never experienced it it                                 wasn't because i lacked sympathy or care                                 it was because there was no real way to                                 have that understanding having not lived                                 through it myself                                 and so that i'm hoping that by sharing                                 some of these stories today i will be                                 able to make those invisible things                                 visible                                 and tangible to each of us as an                                 exercise in growing our empathy                                 so here we are in days where um                                 to say that child care options are                                 scarce i think is a generous way to put                                 it                                 um uh we are in a in a situation where                                 for the first time uh there are many                                 many people worldwide who are doing                                 their work where possible                                 from the the comfort and safety of their                                 homes but they're also doing                                 it where there are no actual resources                                 to help them care for their offspring                                 and                                 this is this is considerably challenging                                 because you get interrupted while you're                                 giving presentations at great                                 conferences like foss backstage                                 or you're simply in a constantly                                 interrupt-driven environment because you                                 have the                                 to handle the needs of your children uh                                 while handling                                 your own needs as a person without the                                 usual resources you may call upon in                                 order to make your precious time                                 resources stretch farther such as                                 being able to go out to eat for a meal                                 instead of cooking it at home yourself                                 or                                 being reliant upon other                                 child care options that are no longer                                 available to you because you can't                                 invite someone over to watch your kids                                 in the afternoon if you have an                                 important meeting                                 because that's just simply not something                                 we're doing anymore so                                 i and i and i bring this this point to                                 the fore                                 because i think we're all probably not                                 used to um somebody's kid bouncing into                                 one of our meetings and                                 and being really um you know hopefully                                 generous and accepting of that as as                                 part of our new normal                                 but what i i think is invisible to some                                 extent is the uh just the enormous                                 mental pressure that comes with                                 the feeling that you're uh you're in a                                 position where                                 you are not able to give the amount of                                 presence that you want to to your                                 children and you're not able to get the                                 amount of presence that you want to to                                 your work and that you are you are uh                                 effectively failing at both of your                                 endeavors right which can be                                 uh have a really negative psychological                                 impact                                 on an individual because you know we are                                 creatures who like                                 to succeed and where we feel like we are                                 trapped in a situation where we can                                 cannot succeed because we cannot do well                                 for                                 either side um it can be uh                                 exhausting and a drain on our mental                                 health resources                                 um and additionally i don't want to um                                 to suggest at all that the only folks                                 who are                                 are struggling with care                                 responsibilities are those who are                                 caring for children i myself am caring                                 for children but i also have several                                 elder care responsibilities as well                                 and i know folks who have uh much deeper                                 elder care responsibilities                                 um to to parents or other agent loved                                 ones                                 and you know one of the stories that i                                 wanted to to share today was my um                                 my red hat mentor actually um at the                                 start of the pandemic                                 uh his family made the choice to have                                 his his father                                 move in to their home because they were                                 concerned                                 that he would not uh be as safe                                 living in a senior citizen's center                                 and so not only was their family coping                                 with                                 the need to bring the children into the                                 home adjust to homeschooling                                 a whole bunch of different                                 responsibilities there but                                 simultaneously                                 now elder care responsibilities were a                                 part of that and all within the scope of                                 a home that was never                                 designed nor anticipated to be one in                                 which there would be another adult                                 living                                 in that location um and there's also                                 something to be said for the                                 the overall again talking about items of                                 um overarching                                 concern you know as we look at news                                 reports about what is happening uh                                 worldwide                                 with the state of the infrastructure                                 that's meant to care for                                 our elderly populations those                                 infrastructure resources are straining                                 the the businesses that have uh chosen                                 to be                                 in the area of caring for senior                                 citizens have found themselves                                 uh financially devastated due to the                                 requirements for coping with the                                 pandemic that have                                 exponentially increased costs while the                                 folks that they care for are on on a                                 fixed income and there's a                                 an op there's a very good chance there's                                 going to be some huge destabilization                                 in our ability to rely on uh social                                 infrastructure that has been created to                                 care for                                 uh the elders in our lives so you know                                 again                                 the uh the impact of the pandemic is not                                 just about our our youngest                                 most vulnerable members of our society                                 it's about our elders and                                 who are on the other end of the spectrum                                 of most vulnerable members of our                                 society                                 um additionally you know as we are                                 facing all of these challenges                                 um i would say mental health care                                 resources are scarce or non-existent                                 um as somebody who believes that mental                                 health care with uh you know                                 professional service is an extremely                                 important part of my own                                 self-care regimen um you know i am                                 fortunate in that i had access to mental                                 health care resources                                 prior to uh corona ever                                 becoming a part of our lives and yet                                 i know many many people who because of                                 the pandemic they felt very emotionally                                 and healthy and secure prior to all of                                 the changes                                 now that these changes have taken place                                 they are looking for additional support                                 and                                 help around their mental health and                                 well-being and unsurprisingly                                 there are not sufficiently available                                 trained professional resources to cope                                 with the increased demand                                 for mental health care that have come                                 about because of the pandemics so while                                 we are now coping with                                 extreme stressors completely different                                 new                                 different situations than we were used                                 to to handling an                                 unprecedented change in the way of you                                 know just going about our daily life                                 in a time when we were all fairly                                 stressed even before corona came to us                                 this is this is then something that is                                 is hugely devastating                                 um to folks because when you find that                                 you are in need of care                                 and you go to ask for it and then                                 suddenly discover it is not available                                 that is um it's just it's a dire                                 situation to be in                                 um and while we're talking about the the                                 challenges faced by folks during the                                 times of corona i want to be really                                 clear um                                 that the the impact of the pandemic has                                 disproportionately                                 disenfranchised and negatively affected                                 women um                                 hands down so if we look at our                                 life outside of the time of the pandemic                                 i think it's it's pretty clear and very                                 very well documented                                 um that you know household work or the                                 domestic economy                                 falls disproportionately to women you                                 know the expectation is that women will                                 do                                 much of the household labor um as                                 opposed to their uh                                 their male partners and you know that                                 was a difficult situation which i think                                 a lot of folks in society were                                 attempting to negotiate                                 for for quite a while and looking to                                 bring about positive change but in the                                 wake of the pandemic                                 the strain that that creates has become                                 that much more manifest um you know i                                 remember                                 at the very start of lockdowns back in                                 march of last year                                 i mean i would literally spend five                                 hours a day doing laundry                                 just because if we left the house to go                                 get groceries                                 you know every single article of                                 clothing clothing needed to be cleaned                                 we all took a shower you know this was                                 the current guidance and                                 having that and that was simply one                                 of the household tasks that needed to be                                 done now add on to that                                 cooking three meals a day when before                                 one might have gotten                                 take out food or not needed to do that                                 because people would be outside of the                                 home for some of those meals and that                                 was not a responsibility that fell to                                 someone in the home                                 uh you know keeping the place clean                                 making sure that there are clean dishes                                 etc                                 all of this disproportionately impacts                                 women because women are                                 are typically expected to be the ones in                                 the household who are doing that work to                                 begin with and it is not as though                                 uh more time resources suddenly became                                 available in women's lives at the start                                 of the pandemic to take on all of these                                 increased care responsibilities                                 there's also the um unfortunate fact                                 that what we we look at as short-term                                 challenges                                 um are actually incredibly negatively                                 impactful to women's careers long-term                                 so we are seeing a record number of                                 women                                 uh leaving the workforce in order to                                 stay at home and perform care work for                                 children or                                 for aged relatives uh                                 more often than not women are the ones                                 making the sacrifices when it comes to                                 their careers as opposed to their male                                 partners                                 in some cases that is because other male                                 partners earn more                                 because of the well-documented wage gap                                 between men and women's earnings                                 so we have a systemic problem of the                                 wage gap                                 coming in and impacting women's ability                                 to be successful in the future                                 because since the wage gap existed and                                 their labor has been valued less                                 economically                                 they're there for the ones to drop out                                 of the workforce and then                                 take the economic hit of then trying to                                 re-enter the workforce later                                 competing for jobs when those jobs are                                 able to be taken by                                 several folks who want to re-enter the                                 workforce potentially                                 not having the opportunity to go back to                                 the same work or at the same level of                                 seniority as they did before                                 and even for those who do not drop out                                 of the workforce who remain in                                 professional employment                                 they're just simply not the same set of                                 opportunities available to you                                 when you are um trying to                                 uh do your do your best to be an                                 effective human being during your global                                 pandemic                                 um you know just sharing my own                                 experience i've been                                 working very hard on a management track                                 promotion at red hat for a while now                                 working in concert with my manager we                                 had a great plan                                 several projects that we were going to                                 complete stuff to execute that's                                 fantastic                                 and i've chosen um to de-prioritize                                 working on a promotion track                                 this year because simply because it is                                 not possible for me                                 to do the kind of work required to                                 advocate for my ability to be promoted                                 okay so that's fair and that's a and                                 that's a choice that i've made and it's                                 a reasonable choice to make                                 but what that means is effectively there                                 are                                 there's going to be one to two years                                 where                                 i should have been in the ready to be                                 promoted ready to move my career                                 seniority up my earning potential up etc                                 that are they're simply gone and they're                                 simply gone because                                 um you know this short term challenge                                 actually                                 it ends up having a very long term                                 effect because the the choice if the                                 choice is between                                 um career trajectory versus                                 family care versus the ability to                                 perform some sort of self-care by not                                 you know uh burning myself out trying to                                 do too much                                 in a possible time you know the choice                                 to me is obvious right it's it's care                                 for my child                                 and it's uh it's care for myself so                                 while we are thinking through um the the                                 challenges that women are facing                                 right now today and how you know it                                 sucks uh to be the one                                 who gets interrupted during your zoom                                 meeting because                                 our you know your children more often                                 than not will probably ask mom where                                 their                                 uh where their tony is and not someone                                 else in the house                                 um it's not just the the day-to-day                                 uh difficulties it's that what we're                                 experiencing right now is going to have                                 long-term cumulative effects on our                                 careers                                 and you know we're we're working and                                 trying to                                 uh do our very best to continue being                                 effective in this new normal                                 um against the backdrop of realizing                                 that we are taking a serious long-term                                 hit while we are struggling um                                 to make things you know work day-to-day                                 and i think the you know the hardest                                 thing for me as a professional woman and                                 i                                 and i know that i echo this i echo a                                 sentiment that i've heard expressed many                                 many times um                                 in one-on-one conversations with friends                                 over video                                 no matter what you do no matter what                                 choice you are making                                 you are always choosing to                                 either neglect your work and be less                                 successful there                                 neglect your family and be successful                                 there and potentially                                 have long-term repercussions in terms of                                 your                                 um you know your offsprings emotional                                 mental health their                                 cognitive development et cetera and                                 yourself right                                 something no matter what is being                                 sacrificed and sometimes it's all three                                 of those things                                 um just simply to continue to maintain                                 and that is that is an extremely                                 extremely uncomfortable position to be                                 in because i think                                 um given the choice uh you know                                 none of us would would choose to sacrif                                 you know would choose to neglect                                 those things uh and certainly for women                                 where you know                                 we we have uh again well documented                                 uh tendencies to prioritize our own                                 needs last                                 um when it comes to uh either care for                                 our families or making sure that we                                 excel in our careers                                 you know now we're at we're in a                                 position where it's not only                                 a question of whether or not our needs                                 are prioritized last it's a question of                                 whether we're going to meet our needs at                                 all                                 um because some of us are trying to                                 squeeze in our ability to get our jobs                                 done                                 at three o'clock in the morning before                                 the children wake up                                 and then you know again at                                              uh until                                 you know midnight in order to get our                                 work done after they go to sleep so um                                 again as i've said before you know this                                 is this is a near impossible                                 challenge that we face so um so enough                                 gloom and doom                                 and enough and enough it hurts um what                                 is it that we can do                                 to to improve these matters right                                 they're clear there has to be a light at                                 the end of this tunnel it's not a train                                 so the first thing that i would i would                                 advocate for is to start with empathy                                 right when you're when you're                                 interacting with your colleagues and                                 your your co-workers please try to be                                 empathetic about their situations                                 based on what you may know of them as                                 human beings or what they may have                                 shared with you                                 so you know a couple of hot takes um                                 gentlemen                                 if you are in a meeting with several of                                 your female colleagues whom you know                                 have children and whom you know                                 do not have partners who uh                                 who do not work outside the home right                                 do not do not spend five minutes of your                                 meeting ranting                                 about how hard it is for you when the                                 kids are at home when you have a partner                                 at home who also helps you                                 with all these tasks and does not have                                 full-time work because it can make                                 things very uncomfortable for your                                 female colleagues                                 who are navigating the exact same                                 situation you are but do not have the                                 resources of an additional                                 pair of hands or partner to focus on                                 those domestic                                 economy needs um and also you know                                 for for those of us who who don't have                                 children who are seeing kids bounce off                                 the walls                                 during video conference meetings um                                 remarks like that's why i didn't have                                 kids                                 are not super helpful um it may be true                                 it's not necessarily the best thing to                                 share at that moment in time                                 and i would also like to say that you                                 know for those of us who are struggling                                 with these additional care                                 responsibilities that are                                 that are new and unprecedented also                                 having some empathy for our colleagues                                 who                                 are not necessarily facing that                                 challenge right like                                 it is very clear to me that                                 there are folks on um you know my team                                 or within my company who they don't have                                 children                                 and they are working a lot harder much                                 much harder                                 to fill the gaps that are left because                                 those of us who do have                                 um family care responsibilities are not                                 able to give as much as we once were                                 right and and having some empathy and                                 some kindness for the amount of stress                                 and pressure that they are feeling to                                 perform                                 because we are not able to give as much                                 as we once did i think is really                                 important too and being                                 and not only being empathetic and aware                                 of it but thanking them                                 for taking that time to support us and                                 and being really clear that we                                 know that that is happening and that we                                 acknowledge it and we're grateful                                 um create environments where where real                                 talk is safe right                                 i am very fortunate that you know i the                                 the company                                 i work for encourages real talk and open                                 communication and the team that i work                                 on also                                 values uh people bringing their whole                                 self into the office                                 so i absolutely encourage folks to                                 create work environments in which people                                 can just be honest like if you're having                                 a horrible day                                 because you know you joined the bad moms                                 club because your kid finally cut off                                 all of their own hair because you were                                 in a call too long in the morning                                 this did not just happen to me on monday                                 no                                 right that someone can talk about that                                 and talk about their feelings of                                 insecurity they're feeling and talk                                 about the                                 the guilt or the heart that they're                                 feeling like they're neglecting their                                 child and they're neglecting their work                                 at the same time right we need to be                                 able to have a place where we can                                 express                                 the truth and the reality of what we are                                 all experiencing at this time                                 uh and because our normal social support                                 systems are not functioning as they once                                 did                                 so much of our social interaction is now                                 being driven through through our work                                 and our our office our office                                 engagements                                 so you know rethink what professionalism                                 means to you and give a place for people                                 to actually just be themselves                                 and perform real talk and just continue                                 um normalize care responsibilities so                                 um you know i think it should be it is                                 it is incumbent upon                                 every uh workplace to make sure that it                                 is very very clear                                 that it is understood that there are                                 care responsibilities                                 um that come with uh being in a pedant                                 and being in a pandemic and that there                                 are going to be times when we are going                                 to need to give time to                                 the elders in our lives to the children                                 in our lives to our fellow fellow family                                 members etc                                 even even needing to take a mental                                 health day because it's all just a bit                                 too much right and and normalizing that                                 that is a thing and that it                                 is it is valid and that it is real um is                                 important right we cannot we cannot say                                 to everybody oh                                 you know we think you're all going to do                                 fine and then you know                                 uh naked you know ping our co-workers                                 and back channel and say like it's not                                 cool that you missed that meeting                                 you know we know you had such and such                                 happening with your you know your                                 grandparents but it really wasn't okay                                 that you were there                                 um last but not least if you are in a                                 position of leadership or management i                                 think it's                                 incredibly important to make uh revised                                 performance expectations explicit                                 so if if it is clear to you that you do                                 not expect your employees to be able to                                 perform the level that they normally did                                 that's great and it's wonderful to say                                 that but it's also really important to                                 have conversations with each of your                                 individual employees about what they                                 reason                                 can reasonably accomplish given their                                 own constraints                                 and to make sure that they understand                                 that their performance is going to be                                 judged according to very specific                                 criteria that you're going to work with                                 them so that they can meet it                                 right um because unfortunately you                                 either get folks who are going to                                 uh exhaust themselves by trying to over                                 perform in a situation where they don't                                 have enough resources because they're                                 not sure what target they're trying to                                 hit                                 right or you're going to have folks who                                 because they don't know what is expected                                 of them they're going to feel a                                 sense of paralysis and freezing because                                 they just they do not know what is                                 expected of them they think that they                                 have to perform as they have always                                 performed in challenging circumstances                                 and because that is a recipe that is                                 doomed for failure                                 uh they end up being not able to do                                 anything at all                                 right so just just be really clear on                                 what you expect people to be able to do                                 and then you know it's fine to hold                                 people accountable even in tough times                                 but make sure that you're holding them                                 accountable for something that is                                 reasonable                                 explicit and agreed upon                                 uh and last but not least i know this is                                 silly and cliche but just                                 give yourself and everyone else around                                 you a break um                                 you know it's okay if your kid cuts off                                 all their own hair because you were in                                 meetings all day it is okay                                 if one of your co-workers you know                                 didn't get back to you immediately it's                                 okay if someone misses a meeting                                 it's okay if the talk that you gave at a                                 conference wasn't the best talk you ever                                 gave                                 um you know we are all doing the very                                 very best that we can                                 and if that you know that that has to be                                 enough because it is all that we have to                                 give so if you find yourself                                 um being really critical of other people                                 try to give them some grace and do your                                 very best to extend that grace to                                 yourself as well                                 and then the last point that i want to                                 make because i think it's a really                                 important one                                 is um i think we all need to spend                                 all as human beings and as as citizens                                 of our respective countries and as                                 citizens of this planet earth                                 um we need to rethink about the way we                                 structure our world                                 um because what we have discovered in                                 this time is that our social systems                                 our supply chains our um economic                                 systems                                 are our social safety nets right                                 um they don't have the kind of                                 resiliency built into them that is                                 required for                                 uh times in which our we are facing                                 global challenges and we really need to                                 rethink about how we                                 structure how we approach life in order                                 to ensure that                                 should we find ourselves in in these                                 tender times for a long period of time                                 or again                                 that we're able to make better choices                                 that allow us to handle                                 adversity in a more sustainable way                                 thank you all for listening and for your                                 patience with my                                 interruption and i believe we may have a                                 minute for questions so i'm going to                                 turn it over to                                 paul who may have yes                                 thank you leslie thank you very much for                                 your talk                                 um we don't actually have any questions                                 yet                                 but um a lot of people uh expressed                                 that they they totally understand and                                 you said you you hope that people will                                 accept those situations and being                                 interrupted as kind of as a normality                                 and our audience has truly done that and                                 the comments are                                 wonderful and they are sending there are                                 these emoji reactions you can't see them                                 um but i've been watching them and a lot                                 of hearts been                                 bubbling up all the time so                                 yes thank you very much                                 you
