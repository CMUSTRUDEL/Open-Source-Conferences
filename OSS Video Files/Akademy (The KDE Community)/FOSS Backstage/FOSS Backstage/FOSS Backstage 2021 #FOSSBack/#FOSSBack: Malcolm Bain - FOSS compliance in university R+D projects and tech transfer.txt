Title: #FOSSBack: Malcolm Bain - FOSS compliance in university R+D projects and tech transfer
Publication date: 2021-02-25
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	University based hackers are some of the most prolific and participative open source contributors. Many University and other public R+D centres have little idea how much FOSS they are producing, nor how much they are using. This has two implications: inbound compliance with third party open source, particularly on subsequent tech transfer (distribution); and outbound license choice and the impacts in terms of licensing, confidentiality, community building, and university processes. R+D proyects have certain characteristics (how they are developed, university rights, ownership, etc,) that make governance and compliance "interesting" to say the least. I, open source lawyer for nigh on 20 years, will tell you some horror (and success) stories.

	                              thank you again to the organizers for                               inviting me this is the second talk                               i had a great talk yesterday with andy                               katz another open source lawyer                               on um open source public open source law                               uh                               projects um today i'm want to have a                               very quick                               look at um another work i'm doing                                on open source in the area of r d a                                research and development and university                                um a lot of open source comes from                                universities                                and we're seeing actually that although                                the projects are great and there's lots                                of scientific quality and there's lots                                of things going on there                                um when it comes to complying with the                                licensing and                                actually getting things right let's say                                um things are not                                necessarily up to scratch so i've been                                asked to advise in a couple of                                universities                                um to to help them sort this out and get                                into some                                best practices and processes in uh                                in working and managing open source in                                these projects                                just to situate you um a quick user                                story                                this is kind of like compiling some                                ideas together imagine you're                                or i am a researcher at the university                                i've got to create some form of                                ai model for a hospital who wants to do                                some                                image recognition for i don't know bones                                or brains or whatever                                and so i'm doing lots of research and                                i'm pulling from the internet lots of                                already existing software modules                                there's there's loads of                                open source modules uh for ai already on                                the web there's lots of models there's                                lots of data as well                                which i can pull not just uh data from                                the hospital because they're going to                                give me some                                images of the bones that i'm going to be                                working with but also there are lots of                                databases of bones                                out there under so-called open licenses                                or not                                and all this i'm running on an open                                source stack obviously with linux and                                various other                                bits and pieces um just to facilitate                                um sharing because this is a                                collaborative research project                                with other people with other uh research                                entities                                and i have to actually deliver this to                                the hospital i'm going to containerize                                this                                uh with doc or whatever and deliver                                so this fairly classical story of um r                                d at the university raises a fair number                                of issues                                in relation to what one needs to do to                                make sure that this is                                um done correctly from a legal point of                                view so um                                basically what we hear what we're having                                is that research and development                                which is a very open environment uh lots                                of freedom to                                to research to do things freedom to                                share freedom to collaborate                                um meets up with foss compliance so here                                we go                                they're not at loggerheads they're not                                against each other but um                                the idea is just to make sure that when                                you're doing r d                                the the the legal quality of your work                                is uh                                is important it's probably not as                                important                                as the scientific quality but it to                                actually be able to deliver and                                distribute                                the software legally you do need to                                comply with the licenses                                so as we know from foss compliance and                                i've seen that                                here backstage this year a number of                                colleagues of                                mine have been talking about open chain                                 which i will mention                                 and other forms of licensing compliance                                 and activities                                 we all know that open source has a                                 license these licenses                                 do have conditions it's not free-for-all                                 that would be public domain and there's                                 some specific licenses like the copyleft                                 licenses with this and the copyleft                                 obligations to use the same license                                 when you redistribute okay so um                                 and that's a little bit of red tape                                 that's a bit of a headache um                                 and researchers are not very keen in                                 getting on with that                                 so so the experience i've had is that um                                 apart from the the headache not really                                 keen to to do all the paperwork of                                 looking at licenses and doing a license                                 inventory                                 um there's not much understanding or not                                 good understanding                                 among researchers of the different                                 flavors of open source licensing                                 um and there's a general idea that well                                 it's open there we can use it i'm                                 i'm at the research institution so i can                                 do what i want                                 and unfortunately that is not the case                                 okay                                 also i find that um no criticisms but                                 but                                 the software development is very                                 disorganized from                                 from people who are working already in                                 github or gitlab                                 and and have got all everything managed                                 properly                                 to people who just do their work on                                 their laptop and store the stuff in                                 google drive or dropbox um or even on                                 the local drive                                 that's a nightmare in terms of                                 management                                 for the research group for the tech                                 transfer office for the university                                 because if people don't really know                                 where that software is and how it's been                                 developed and managed                                 then very difficult to know the ip                                 and can we transfer this or can we                                 distribute can we even release it as                                 free software                                 and to society okay and another                                 dimension here which is really important                                 is                                 there's a significant amount of sharing                                 of                                 code among developers not just                                 internally within the same                                 university but among universities                                 among entities in these big european                                 research projects with private                                 companies public companies uh public                                 entities so                                 um there's lots of sharing going on and                                 we know that when we share we're                                 distributing and when we distribute                                 we have to look at the licenses so um                                 the the idea here is is basically to                                 look at the challenges that are specific                                 to university r d                                 they're not the same as private                                 companies or as individuals                                 working independently um and see how we                                 can                                 adjust these and what should we do what                                 we implement okay not going to go                                 through all these issues                                 but um we're noticing that universities                                 do want to release                                 as open source and they think some of                                 them just think that putting on github                                 that's it                                 and as you know we have to have a                                 license we need to check their                                 ip and there's all sorts of technical                                 and organizational issues                                 um that you have to take care of as well                                 so just just checking up on the internet                                 is not                                 freeing software um there also there are                                 tech transfer issues here tech transfer                                 is the office                                 of the university which is looking at                                 the research and saying what can we                                 transfer to society                                 what can we license for money you know                                 get some funding for new research                                 um and and who can we collaborate with                                 in society you know industry                                 public sector to to to work on these                                 projects                                 and and obviously when you're                                 transferring out of the university                                 into society again                                 we're distributing we need to take care                                 of the the ip                                 and the licensing issues um so here                                 comes the the knight in white armor                                 um we've been working in the open source                                 law                                 uh area for the last                                          and you've probably heard already too                                 much about open chain but it's a                                 standard now it's a                                 it's an iso standard uh and basically                                 it's a set of best practices for open                                 source development                                 to ensure that um in this case the                                 supply chain                                 is compliant so when you have a supply                                 chain of four or five different                                 uh entities involved                                 the compliance goes down the chain and                                 so the person who's distributing it at                                 the end                                 whether it's a car for a manufacturer or                                 a modem manufacturer or whatever                                 technology                                 they know that all everything coming                                 upstream from other people                                 is compliant and makes the makes the the                                 whole                                 issue of of compliance much easier if                                 everybody's done their homework                                 okay so there's a best practice out                                 there and what we're trying to do and                                 the projects i'm working on                                 is to bring open chain into the                                 university and it's not where it's not                                 easy                                 openten is aimed at um private companies                                 large uh industrial supply chains and                                 although the universities are members                                 of those supply chains you know this                                 quadruple helix type idea                                 um they're not used to the the the                                 diligence and the                                 the rigor of of of private companies and                                 and proper                                 i would say uh software development                                 practices                                 okay so what have we got we've got a                                 process we've got a specification                                 there's even a website where you can go                                 and visit all that stuff                                 okay and what i'm doing at the um these                                 universities is trying to implement                                 these best practices in the r d                                 department                                 and it's a bit like hitting my head                                 against a wall um because                                 you know there's these large                                     software developers and                                 or or or scientists working in in                                 biochemistry or whatever                                 and and they're they're not very keen to                                 know about licensing                                 but it's important and when they                                 actually do get the the story                                 they say yeah that's true that's really                                 important okay so                                 the goal is really is to ensure                                 compliance which is obviously a good                                 thing                                 it makes makes the university legal no                                 one can sue the university                                 for breach of the open source licenses                                 which is a good thing um                                 in it's also to establish best practices                                 in in compliance but also that's married                                 to best practices and software                                 development                                 because if you if you're developing code                                 in in a quality manner you know quality                                 practices then obviously the license                                 comes in as an element of this quality                                 okay and the other thing office is well                                 if if you do have                                 research software which is properly                                 compliant and ip's                                 cleared and you know what license you                                 want to use then it's very easy                                 to release uh as uh open source                                 correctly                                 on the web or to anybody else so i think                                 it's an important thing and all this                                 falls within the umbrella these days of                                 open science                                 and making sure that um when you do open                                 science in this sense                                 uh whether it's data whether it's code                                 whether it's whatever else                                 um that then you are complying with                                 everything                                 in the right manner okay so i'm not                                 going to go through the details of here                                 it's the typical mission                                 of setting up um some procedures in the                                 policy                                 um identifying the people who are going                                 to be helping                                 work with um compliance giving them the                                 tools                                 training the staff so it's a typical con                                 life like you know                                 mission to to implement some some best                                 practices                                 okay and we did the first stage that we                                 did last year in the middle of covet                                 um open chain has five chapters uh                                 the first one is program foundation so                                 basically setting it up                                 the policy overall policy competences                                 the second one is tasks which is                                 identifying who does what                                 and with what resources in terms of                                 identifying licenses                                 identifying the code storing the                                 materials everything                                 the third one is review and approval                                 which is actually looking at a real                                 project and saying                                 you are using these licenses and these                                 components and therefore you must comply                                 with these obligations                                 okay fourth chapter keeping that                                 evidence                                 that's really important because so many                                 research projects                                 um just kind of like they start and then                                 if there's no proof of concept or                                 it didn't really work it is dropped the                                 code's still there and they may even be                                 shared                                 but you know you lose the evidences you                                 have of what software was used and how                                 it was used                                 very important and the final point                                 engagement                                 which is the final chapter is best                                 practices in engaging with the open                                 source community                                 and and getting contributions or setting                                 up your own open source project                                 and and building a community okay so                                 this is the project and                                 and we we had some um we had first                                 iteration we looked at some projects                                 um you know quite quite agile style and                                 and we got some we came to some                                 conclusions here                                 on on you know we we drew some pictures                                 of how                                 the process could be done and in fit                                 into the specific r d                                 process which is not quite the same                                 process as an industrial process                                 for building software for a client or                                 even an open source process because                                 that's much more um                                 not disorganized but not coherently or                                 necessarily                                 structured in a hierarchical manner okay                                 um conclusions well um the first                                 conclusions are that actually                                 when you get over the barrier of of                                 being a lawyer                                 telling these things um the research are                                 actually quite key not on it they do                                 understand that there's a there's                                 something important there                                 and it's seen as part of the quality of                                 their research so um                                 that's important it's also seen as an                                 enabler                                 for sharing so so if they what they                                 don't want is to want to share                                 code with another university or to                                 deliver to a client                                 you know some contract research and                                 suddenly                                 the tech transfer office puts up a red                                 flag and says oops                                 sorry this is full of gpl copy left code                                 and we agreed to sell this                                 under a proprietary license you know a                                 commissioned um                                 sponsored development with a private                                 client and                                 and that's kind of like a we have a                                 contradiction between the gpl                                 requirement to to distribute under the                                 gpl                                 and the contract with the private entity                                 that they want the ipr and not to be                                 bound by copyleft                                 okay so it's an important thing for them                                 they suddenly realize this is important                                 okay but there are a number of                                 challenges challenges relating to where                                 general awareness so not just                                 the people we work with but but a                                 cultural awareness that this is                                 important                                 um there's usually no procedures and                                 guidelines on how to deal with this                                 um you know we can all go on stack                                 overflow where everybody can go to                                 openchainproject.org                                 and they can learn but it's quite                                 difficult                                 um they need some tools um we've worked                                 with several departments some of them                                 have a centralized gitlab and a great                                 repository infrastructure                                 and they've taught how to use and work                                 with gitlab get                                 get get procedures you know pull                                 requests etc emerges                                 fine and they've got the repository they                                 can do a backup they can store things                                 as i said other people just do it on                                 their laptop or a piece of paper                                 and then then to do any license                                 compliance there is complete is                                 completely impossible                                 okay and the general end so the second                                 stage of what we're doing                                 so we did a pilot we look we sorted out                                 what the problems were                                 we and in agile terms we we have a                                 backlog of things to do                                 when we actually have a whole epic um                                 that we have to deploy but                                 our work on but anyway so what we want                                 to do is to set up                                 um a competence center and this is                                 becoming quite fashionable um the                                 european union                                 commission has just published a paper or                                 is about to publish it but it's least                                 it's it's                                 been uh made public about um open source                                 in the in the european union and one of                                 their big recommendations is setting up                                 a what they call ospose open source um                                 offices okay competence officers this is                                 a bit the same                                 what we're saying is that well someone                                 in the university and here it's probably                                 the tech transfer office                                 because they're the most um keen to get                                 this right                                 um how needs to have the skills i have                                 the documents the materials                                 to be able to be an evangelist and and                                 transmit this to the research groups                                 okay so we're setting up a competence                                 center it's going to take us about six                                 months                                 focusing on awareness understanding                                 getting concrete processes and materials                                 for the research groups to to absorb                                 and to work with and to coordinate                                 amongst research centers because                                 universities have you know                                 some big universities have eight up to                                                                                                          departments                                 and and you know you start one one of                                 them but then the other guys get key and                                 then you suddenly have                                 you know critical mass and everybody's                                 very happy because                                 we're complying all over the university                                 which would be brilliant                                 okay so here again we're going a little                                 bit agile we've got some sprints and                                 some some                                 iterations um apart from just defining                                 what the competent center should do                                 um i think there are three main ones so                                 the first thing is setting up an                                 infrastructure                                 it's really important to have the tools                                 to do this um it's very difficult to                                 look at source code if you don't                                 have a git type repository so that needs                                 to be defined                                 it's very difficult to store anything                                 unless you've got long-term storage                                 um processes set up okay and there are                                 lots of tools out there to do this                                 there's scanners there's code scanners                                 there's software                                                         information so setting up the                                 infrastructure to make it easy                                 and to automate a lot of this is really                                 important                                 um the second action line we're working                                 is new pilots so we're working                                 bottom up we're gonna you know we're                                 basically seeding the idea                                 in the small research groups the bigger                                 research groups that they need to do                                 some compliance work and um hopefully                                 they will chat about it over lunch well                                 you don't have lunch these days together                                 but when when you do get together again                                 they'll talk about it over lunch and                                 think it's a good idea                                 and then from one project it'll it'll                                 spin over to another project and                                 hopefully we get some again critical                                 mass so that so that the idea gets                                 gets adopted and said let's do that and                                 part of normal best practice                                 okay and i think the third area we're                                 working on is community                                 i think that's really important um the                                 moment a lot of research is done there's                                 a big research community and they feel                                 they are a member of a community                                 but it's a scientific community about                                 the areas of science where they're                                 working                                 it's not a open source community so                                 um i think what we're trying to build                                 here is is this                                 get the skills and the knowledge into a                                 minimum of people who are                                 who like the idea and who can help each                                 other out                                 and so that um the competence center is                                 not that you know not the single                                 source of all information and know-how                                 but it's a community of people who can                                 help each other                                 setting up the usual community disk you                                 know discussion lists um slack channels                                 ircs whatever the developers use to                                 communicate                                 uh and and have you know online or                                 offline events together                                 um around this concept and that that's                                 really important for sustainability                                 because we can go in and we can work for                                 six months but if                                 um if the the um                                 we leave and we know we leave this                                 conference center and they have the                                 staff they do it                                 unless we've achieved um                                 the community it's not going to stay                                 because researchers come and go you know                                 over four years                                 you probably there's probably rotation                                 about                                                           of the the junior staff the senior staff                                 tend to stay                                 um and that's difficult because it means                                 onboarding it means bringing people in                                 means bringing people luckily                                 universities are producing                                 software engineers developers and                                 scientists who are                                 becoming more and more aware of open                                 source and license requirements                                 but um anyway if we have this community                                 if we have the                                 events set up you have the the community                                 dynamics                                 then we're hoping that this will be                                 sustainable and and that the                                 certification because there is an open                                 source certification                                 can be achieved year after year because                                 they've achieved the right amount of                                 quality okay                                 so where are we now um just to conclude                                 and and                                 i hope i haven't gone too fast through                                 all of this um                                 well we're setting up the competence                                 center as i said we're defining the                                 materials                                 and the processes we're working with the                                 developers we're going to go into at                                 least another three if not four                                 projects and do the homework for them so                                 we're going to act as if we are doing                                 the                                 the compliance for them but the idea is                                 in the next batch                                 which will be the second three-month                                 period um                                 we'll be guiding the researchers                                 themselves to do the compliance work you                                 know to scanning their code                                 ensuring that all the licenses are there                                 making it working on the                                 copyleft incompatibilities taking                                 decisions about                                 licensing and what type of license do we                                 want to use                                 and do we want to free this you know and                                 matching                                 the code we have with whatever tech                                 transfer                                 uh um you know channel has been decided                                 you know this is private licensing                                 is open source is this uh whatever                                 okay so um that that's important                                 another area is is that obviously this                                 is to do with ip management it's not                                 just open source management it's all                                 intellectual property uh which includes                                 patents unfortunately in the software                                 so um what we're looking at is                                 integrating                                 these open chain style processes                                 for quality into the general ip                                 management                                 so i mean you know you have to you still                                 have to know who wrote the code and how                                 it was written                                 and with whom um and under what contract                                 if it's if it's a you know age                                      development grant or something um you                                 still need to know that so open source                                 just falls in                                 it's another leg of good project                                 management                                 okay um also it's important to actually                                 understand                                 what the different universities are                                 capable of um some of them                                 have the resources have a central i.t                                 department who are really keen on                                 setting up                                 they even have a git uh instance or                                 whatever                                 you know they've got they've got the                                 capacities others uh specifically in                                 social sciences                                 uh who also do actually use a lot of                                 open source                                 um don't have any infrastructure at all                                 so                                 or have very little so it's important uh                                 to be to be able to get them on board                                 and and have the infrastructures for                                 them okay                                 [Music]                                 also what we're trying to do is to match                                 all this work into                                 the open science initiatives i think                                 this is a very big                                 and important topic it's a bit late i                                 think this should have been done                                    years ago                                 but uh open science is now a big topic a                                 big big                                 big buzzword if not fashionable but i                                 think it's                                 it's a very good thing in sense of                                 access to know how                                 fair on data f-a-i-r i think should                                 f-a-r                                 on code as well we should be thinking                                 about that you know um                                 and uh there's some great initiatives on                                 uh conservatories                                 for open source code there's some                                 there's a lot of                                 thought about collaborative research and                                 open collaborative research                                 and that is absolutely matching the                                 philosophy and the                                 dynamics of open source as a software                                 development movement                                 so i think the the open source can bring                                 a lot to the open science initiative                                 and vice versa okay so that's really                                 important                                 and just finally um what you know                                 looking at what our challenges are                                 um getting institutional support is not                                 difficult at least                                 not at the research level the university                                 itself sees this as a little bit of                                 um you know time that they don't have to                                 dedicate to this                                 but but usually you know with as i said                                 with open science nearly all                                 universities are                                 i think all of them are in favor and so                                 it's difficult to say                                 i'm in favor of open science but i'm not                                 in favor of open source                                 that that would be totally inconsistent                                 so so that's good                                 um motivating the researchers is the                                 most difficult one                                 and and the unfortunate thing is in                                 times of the                                 the the covet we don't have pizza                                 parties beer free beers                                 you know meetups anything um i've done                                 this before                                 before the pandemic and and just getting                                 people to have a cup of coffee or a beer                                 together um and chat about this is is                                 actually                                 worth hours of seminar in our way                                 so hopefully when all this is over we                                 can we can go back to being normal human                                 beings and being social                                 and use social dynamics to to get this                                 um transferred around and people                                 motivated                                 um transfer skills is not a problem here                                 because these people researchers are                                 really keen to learn they've got big                                 brains                                 they they just take it on board as                                 another step in their research projects                                 um and and the the difficulty here is to                                 well the the only trick is to make these                                 skills                                 seem interesting sexy important um                                 valuable for their curriculum to get so                                 so so that when if they want to transfer                                 or they want to go from being a                                 researcher                                 to industry um they've got skills on                                 their curriculum which are important and                                 they can highlight those                                 so that's good um and as i said a little                                 bit before                                 uh working top down in open source is                                 just                                 is hopeless there's no point i've done                                 we've tried to do it in public sector it                                 doesn't work                                 you've got to be bottom up so this is                                 why we're starting in one department                                 in a few pilot groups and going up and                                 the idea                                 is to to see the revolution um and then                                 with some cross-pollination we we                                 get into some other research department                                 social scientists we get into                                 biochemistry we get into the medical                                 department                                 where there's lots of open source going                                 on lots more than people think                                 um and open even more open data and they                                 have to have the same practices for open                                 data                                 as you have for open source code anyway                                 so that's where we are                                 and that's what i really wanted to say                                 um just to show that you know things are                                 happening                                 and um i think university which is one                                 of the areas where                                 a lot of open source is produced                                 um if they can get on board and produce                                 legally quality open source then we're                                 going to be much easier                                 and a lot of the code on git is in                                 github is going to have a license                                 and that's it thank you very much                                 thank you malcolm thank you very much                                 and um yeah it's great to hear that so                                 much is going on under the radar                                 in the academic sphere and uh getting                                 funding presumably to contribute to                                 i live in spain funding is like a                                 strange word that we don't really know                                 about                                 in germany there's plenty of it but it's                                 um yeah it comes with a lot of strings                                 attached right there                                 but anyway to the questions uh                                 i'm looking again at um uh venulis                                 and those who want to ask questions                                 please put them in the chat                                 in the meanwhile i'll put some questions                                 that came to my mind                                 um yeah first off how can we sign up for                                 your newsletter because you said that's                                 one of the things that you're going to                                 be producing from the competence letter                                 sorry the competence center is there                                 somewhere we can already sign up for                                 early access                                 no you're not yet not yet it's next week                                 we're speaking with the communication                                 people that's a great thing we're doing                                 kind of like bonding with the other                                 departments at the university                                 and the communication people are                                 important because they do internal and                                 external communication                                 so yes but there's there's a newsletter

                     great people                                 um who are actually speaking at the                                 conference as well so um you know shane                                 cochran                                 miriam bahasa there's some great people                                 there who are doing a lot of work                                 fantastic fantastic i'll do that and                                 again about the competence center it                                 sounds very exciting i'm wondering how                                 it's funded is it a pro bono                                 project how does it fit with your work                                 or the others of the other experts who                                 are contributing to this                                 um no well the competence is actually in                                 the university so it's it's funded by                                 the university within the budget of                                 probably of the tech transfer office                                 that's outside my area of knowledge of                                 where where the money comes from                                 um yes i get funded for my advisory                                 services um                                 and the whole point is to do knowledge                                 transfer so that the                                 by the end of this year uh that the                                 competency is up and running by itself                                 so                                 and the funding the funding yes there is                                 funding there's quite a lot of funding                                 coming from public administrations for                                 quality and research and they're putting                                 open source compliance as part of                                 quality                                 okay and there's funding in catalonia                                 than the petr                                 peter projects there's funding in the                                 european union                                 um and probably from the other uh                                 entities for this concept of quality and                                 open science so that's where i'd look                                 for budget                                 that's very interesting and speaking to                                 quality so i understood i think the                                 point about                                 quality in terms of the software being                                 more discoverable                                 more reusable more likely to be                                 incorporated into other projects                                 but about the reproducibility of                                 research that you mentioned                                 how is that affected by the compliance                                 work that you and the competence center                                 are going to be doing                                 well if you've got code which is not                                 legal because you're not complying with                                 the licenses you're not entitled to                                 reproduce it                                 it's as simple as that you can download                                 it and do what you want illegally                                 because if it's not complying with the                                 copyleft licenses                                 it hasn't got the copyright notices                                 boring stuff that lawyers deal with but                                 actually the bread and butter of making                                 open source work um you can't reproduce                                 it because                                 you can't transfer if you can't transfer                                 then nobody else can check it out                                 whether that code actually works                                 so that would i mean that would actually                                 be a practical problem the researchers                                 even if they're just downloading                                 software for their own machine and then                                 they produce a research paper                                 or or yes they'd make some discovery or                                 that questions might be asked about the                                 software they were using and whether                                 they had licenses to use it in the first                                 place                                 yeah a little bit i think that as i said                                 they live in a little bubble where                                 people don't really ask those questions                                 and the trouble is when you take when                                 you transfer out to industry and you've                                 got                                 banks who are taking this up or                                 automotive or                                 you know pharma they're going to ask                                 difficult questions                                 they say well can i use this how can i                                 use this can i build on this can i                                 transfer this to someone else can i sell                                 it                                 and if they suddenly see oh this is full                                 of copyless stuff which is great for the                                 community                                 but industry is still a little bit                                 reluctant to to                                 working with copyleft or they don't know                                 how to unfortunately                                 so so um that that's where the kind of                                 headaches                                 can come from yeah that's great and uh                                 that's a big issue                                 um i've seen as well um and so about the                                 certificates you mentioned some                                 compliance certificates that sounds like                                 a potentially interesting                                 concept that could have uh yeah wider                                 application                                 has there been much thought put to that                                 yet or is it just yeah well it's it's                                 part of the open chain process um it's                                 self-certification                                 so so um if you go on the open chain                                 project site                                 um there's all the information there to                                 actually come into compliance with the                                 specification so you can build your own                                 process and everything and at the end                                 there's kind of a certification                                 questionnaire where you take all the                                 right boxes and you say guys i'm                                 i'm you know i'm compliant so it's a                                 little bit informal as you said it's                                 self-certification                                 now that we are an iso a formal iso                                 standard um i'm sure that it may move to                                 a more formalized thing that some                                 third-party                                 auditor or qualified um standards um                                 verify whatever can can give us their                                 official seal of approval or whatever                                 but i mean for the moment we're working                                 open source we do our things ourselves                                 and we do you know we trust                                 so and transparency provides trust you                                 know helps trust                                 so so yeah but the certification                                 scheme's there and you can you can read                                 the questionnaire                                 and if you tick all the boxes you can                                 say you can go and put your logo on the                                 website and say hey i'm                                 i'm the next one who's compliant                                 yeah absolutely and uh has there been                                 any thought put to                                 campaigns around raising awareness of                                 the work that the the compliance center                                 will be doing i know it's early on and                                 you're getting your publications up and                                 running but                                 you know there seems to be some                                 overlapping for example uh other ngos in                                 the field                                 uh fsp or uh you know open source                                 initiative yeah well i mean fsp and open                                 source                                 have been with open chain for a long                                 time linux foundation is it's it's it's                                 now                                 uh hosted the linux foundation um and                                 there's lots of noise about that if you                                 just look up open chain project                                 and open source and you'll find that                                 there's shane cochlear is is is the                                 greatest communicator in the world just                                 about                                 um so so on open gen itself yes there's                                 lots of noise                                 in open chain in university no this is                                 the first project i know about so                                 so so we're not we're now next week when                                 we speak to the communications                                 guy and girl she she will be telling us                                 when and how                                  how we can communicate this um uh i                                  think                                  we won't be able to do it until the                                  summer but we'll get we'll get out there                                  we'll be writing some stuff about this                                  i imagine students would be a very                                  receptive audience
