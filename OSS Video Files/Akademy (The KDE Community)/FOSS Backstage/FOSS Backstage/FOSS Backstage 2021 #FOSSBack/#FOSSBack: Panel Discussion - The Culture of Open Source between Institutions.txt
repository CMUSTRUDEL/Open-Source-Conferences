i have the honor of                               sharing this session i suppose and                               facilitating it so my name is richard                                litauer i'm here on behalf of                                moss labs i'm sustained and my own                                many different hats which is very                                exciting                                um and what i've been doing                                for the past few years really is trying                                to build networks of people in open                                source program offices                                uh largely with moss labs through this                                thing called ospo plus plus                                which is a network of institutions                                globally where people collaborate                                together                                at universities ngos cities governments                                and the like so we have some people here                                from open source program offices at                                institutions like those to talk about                                how the culture of open source works at                                those offices this is really exciting                                it's for the time for ospos in general                                um especially because of the ec                                commission's report recently where                                they're calling for                                                 made                                we're seeing an explosion of osbos in                                general so hope that we can learn a bit                                more about what they are and how they                                function and how to make sure that they                                follow the spirit of open source                                in this call so                                to introduce our experts we're going to                                after this short introduction talk about

all i'm a professor at                                 portland state university and university                                 of british columbia                                 and i'm here in part because i run a                                 smart city program                                 that includes portland vancouver and                                 seattle washington and so we're looking                                 at                                 kind of a regional perspective on some                                 of these issues and i'll also share a                                 few                                 thoughts from having been vice president                                 for research                                 at two universities for about                                          so hopefully oh listeners you can see we                                 have a pretty diverse panel today                                 a lot of different backgrounds coming                                 together so                                 it was kind of interesting planning this                                 because one of the things is well we                                 have to make sure everyone knows what an                                 open source program office is                                 but then how do you define it and every                                 single person you ask has a different                                 definition for                                 what it is and how it works and whether                                 it's a thing at all or whether it's                                 being open programs office etc etc                                 so we figured instead of defining it and                                 having me talk at all                                 we would ask each of you panelists                                 what does ospo mean for you what do you                                 do at your osbo how do you define it or                                 how have you defined it previously at                                 osbos you've worked at                                 also works well um and                                 where do you see them going so that's a                                 big                                 question yeah well we'll cover going                                 more later in the end so maybe just for                                 now what is an osbo to you at your                                 institution                                 and i think we should actually go around                                 and then maybe have a short discussion                                 afterwards where we share                                 what we've learned from each other while                                 we talked so cat went first last time so                                 to think jonathan fink why don't you go                                 first this time                                 sure well i would say of the six of us                                 i'm the                                 least experienced with ospos and                                 i'm working with a number of cities city                                 governments as well as universities all                                 of which are trying to figure out                                 how they fit into this because i'm in                                 portland                                 and and connected to seattle we have a                                 lot of large tech companies                                 so intel is the largest employer in                                 oregon they have a lot of experience                                 with this as does microsoft as does                                 amazon                                 and we have connections with them so in                                 part we're learning from them but mostly                                 we're learning from the network that                                 richard represents and that he was                                 talking about earlier i think that what                                 the universities and the cities are                                 trying to figure out is                                 what are the benefits to offset the                                 challenges of just getting this                                 organized                                 and telling administrators in both sets                                 of organizations                                 here's something new that you should be                                 thinking about and worrying about                                 when you don't have any staff who are                                 going to make that necessarily your top                                 priority                                 so we've been learning quite a bit                                 already from particularly from johns                                 hopkins university in baltimore                                 and also from a few other cities that                                 are a little bit further on the path                                 than we are i love how you involve                                 cities as well right and ospos doesn't                                 just mean a large industry it could be                                 a network it could be connection and i                                 wouldn't say that you are less                                 experienced                                 um as you said you have                                             experience in research and anything at                                 an administrative level going down                                 i'm talking too much josh what do i                                 suppose mean to you                                 uh so for me in ospo is uh                                 the open source programs office is an                                 interface for a company to the outside                                 world                                 to the to the rest of the open source                                 ecosystem um                                 and for me that means uh sort of inbound                                 and outbound relationships                                 helping to manage relationships open                                 sources really built on relationships                                 but then not just the the relationships                                 and outreach piece but                                 compliance security all the other things                                 that go with managing the use of open                                 source                                 that's uh that's kind of that's kind of                                 how i view an open source program's

  manage the open source supply chain                                 and sort of helping with some of the                                 things that ospo's do                                 you kind of get into the weeds nitty                                 gritty and often you end up building                                 some custom tooling to manage this kind                                 of stuff                                 pride lift is trying to like help people                                 not reinvent the wheel in that way                                 and pay maintainers while at it                                 excellent                                 um thank you for explaining it's hard                                 when you have a non-traditional                                 ospo or non-traditional job you have a                                 lot of experience to say what's going on                                 stephen jacobs you definitely have a                                 very non-traditional ospo                                 mostly because it's from a university                                 can you talk a bit about open with rit                                 yeah so i i can do that um                                 there's there's only a couple of                                 universities so far that                                 have been doing this or looking at doing                                 this and as i said we only started                                 in august we're kind of all over the                                 place because                                 universities are all over the place so                                 we have to                                 try to advise the upper administration                                 on policy and compliance we want to                                 support                                 our faculty and staff and students                                 in doing open work and giving them the                                 resources they need to do that                                 we definitely want to kind of interface                                 as josh said with                                 the outside world as well as well                                 universities are interesting in that                                 um they have three different classes of                                 employees                                 which makes policy interesting you've                                 got uh staff who are staff they're                                 employees and generally that same kind                                 of stuff follows                                 you have faculty who                                 are employees who on the one hand are                                 supposed to make their work public and                                 freely distributed                                 but on the other hand the university and                                 or they                                 often would like to commercialize that                                 as well and                                 where the where it's my research                                 that's openly distributed versus it's my                                 research that's going to get productized                                 where                                 who makes those decisions and how that                                 works can be very gray                                 so we're trying to work through that                                 students in general at universities                                 are essentially the same as employees in                                 terms of                                 university owns their ip but rit is                                 different than that                                 and our students own their own ip so the                                 existing ip policy overall                                 has to make a classification that's                                 different between students                                 and faculty and staff and in the open                                 policy i have to kind of make                                 variations on the theme for all three                                 and also that we're trying to                                 kind of clear policy around not just                                 software but hardware                                 and and open science and open data and                                 open access journals                                 and a lot of universities do have                                 policies here and there about these                                 things but there's no center of gravity                                 so if you want to find the open access                                 policy you have to go                                 to the you to the library often there's                                 lots of variations between how you                                 perform it's a really interesting time                                 to be trying to pull this off                                 excellent um hong you also have a                                 huge breath of experience with working                                 with osbos by building collaborative                                 networks right fos asia works by                                 working with all sorts of companies in                                 asia to bring stuff together as well as                                 individual coders                                 and individual open source advocates um                                 can you talk a bit about                                 what you think osbos are                                 yes so i think um                                 this is an office that um how do i say                                 that uh coordinate different open source                                 strategies and                                 activities so for instance when i work                                 together with the community or with                                 nonprofits organization we do not have                                 an hospital but for for companies like                                 zalando or daimler right                                 so when when you think about an open                                 source program office it means that                                 there might be some funding there might                                 be some business strategy that they want                                 to to write in this direction and when a                                 company                                 in um in a certain site and they make it                                 they have a very clear direction that                                 they want to invest in open source                                 so that it then there is a need of                                 having an office                                 or having a team that managed not only                                 the funding but how to                                 execute the strategies and coordinate                                 with different groups within the company                                 right as orlando we do not have um                                 an hospital but we operate in a                                 different way it could be a team                                 so it's more like doing the project                                 management right so um                                 in some companies that i see the                                 hospital even inside the marketing                                 department                                 or sometimes even inside the hr                                 department so it really depends on                                 the strategy and direction of the                                 company where they want to place asphalt                                 so sometimes they do not call it                                 export equal is a team or they could                                 call it but department is                                 um really depends but but in general                                 it's more about                                 coordinate the effort from different                                 stakeholders and

source                                 so we have lawyer cats                                 that work in osbo we have a lot of                                 people working                                 specifically with individual open source                                 projects                                 last i checked google has something like                                                                                                  that were started at the company um                                 or maybe it's                                                         that are still                                 actively being contributed to we also                                 contribute a lot to                                 other external projects such as linux                                 that means there's a lot of                                 possible surfaces where we could                                 misapply licensing principles we'll say                                 so there's a lot of that we also want to                                 make sure that                                 we're supporting all these projects                                 that we rely on for our infrastructure                                 so                                 along with teams working on                                 sustainability                                 governance community building for                                 projects                                 there's also money on the table that we                                 put out to support                                 projects there's a very important                                 difference though between sponsorships                                 and support a lot of companies                                 sponsor open source at google we seek to                                 support                                 open source we want to provide an                                 underlying layer of support so that                                 projects can keep the lights on rather                                 than                                 sponsoring specific new changes or                                 directions for the code                                 and now i need to stop talking so well                                 sort of you also have a personal hat you                                 mentioned                                 so that was your google hat ah my google                                 hat                                 and my personal hat well my journey with                                 open source started back in the                                                                                                          xinu which is trademark backwards for                                 those of us that                                 remember mount zynu we were the first                                 commercially supported version of bsd                                 unix                                 long before the term open source was                                 created                                 one reason that i'm interested in the                                 interface between                                 corporate and academic open source is                                 to my mind open source started in                                 academia                                 and builds on the rich tradition of                                 collaborative                                 thinking and it always kind of surprises                                 me when people say that you know                                 open source is an adventure of corporate                                 life um                                 anyway big fan of academia i'm kind of                                 puzzled                                 that the concept of an ospo isn't                                 normal now in academia                                 um jonathan and even i think you can                                 speak to that                                 how much trouble did you get into trying                                 to normalize this concept                                 well i i can't say that i actually have                                 normalized it as yet we're we're having                                 discussions primarily at university of                                 british columbia                                 we have had for about the last six                                 months                                 so part of the argument that we've made                                 which came from                                 the people several of the people on this                                 call are in this                                 discussion is that there are a whole set                                 of functions that the university has to                                 do particularly when                                 interfacing with funding agencies where                                 the proposals have to have                                 certain boilerplate and have to have                                 certain processes in place                                 and to have every individual principal                                 investigator or faculty member have to                                 come up with that on their own and be                                 responsible for it                                 is very inefficient and and very                                 unappealing                                 so to one of the ways to convey the                                 potential value of this to                                 administrators who are currently in                                 those roles is to say this is a way to                                 centralize and offload a lot of that                                 responsibility from the hundreds if not                                 thousands of people                                 that are dealing with outside                                 organizations like funding agencies                                 we've also had a quite a bit of                                 participation at ubc                                 from librarians who don't call                                 themselves librarians anymore they are                                 archival scientists and they think a lot                                 about long-term storage of data                                 how data is made available to different                                 communities                                 so when they heard about this they they                                 got quite excited                                 and then we have people in the it office                                 who also see the potential benefit that                                 the                                 ultimate decision maker at                                 probably at both of the universities i'm                                 working with would be the vice president                                 for research                                 and so getting them to recognize what                                 the value is and then to figure out who                                 in their office is going to be                                 responsible for that                                 is is part of the challenge the past                                 year has not                                 not been a good one to find                                 administrators with extra bandwidth                                 they're struggling to figure out just                                 how to change their financial models                                 uh and so this is one additional thing                                 to try to                                 fit into that that agenda but but i                                 would say                                 the discussions we've had so far uh                                 particularly as they interface with                                 cities                                 there's a lot of interest and a lot of                                 enthusiasm and and a lot of potential                                 champions that we could tap into                                 i think you're speaking a lot to my next                                 question which is how do you establish a                                 culture of collaboration                                 collaboration internally um at your                                 institution                                 so it's easy to set up an hospital uh in                                 the sense you can have someone who's                                 hired to say                                 i'm an osbo now use mit license                                 everywhere                                 you know and that's about it but it's                                 much harder                                 to teach people how to do open source                                 internally to make people interested in                                 it internally                                 um saying things like you just mentioned                                 hey                                 you're doing the same process                                           why don't we all just                                 do that once and the hospital will help                                 disseminate that is a great way                                 of getting internal collaboration so                                 i'm curious if you have any other tools                                 uh jonathan fink                                 for internally getting people on board                                 with collaborating in an open source-y                                 kind of way                                 yeah well not to get too much in the                                 weeds but                                 so as i mentioned i was vice president                                 for research for                                                                                                        years at portland state                                 and that's an interesting job where you                                 are talking to                                 all of the research active faculty in                                 the university which place like                                 arizona state can be hundreds and                                 hundreds of them                                 and you are asking them to                                 do more work than they might normally                                 want to because you                                 are you're evaluated on the basis of the                                 research productivity of the institution                                 but you're not actually doing that work                                 yourself                                 so you have to learn how to be                                 persuasive and um                                 and and you don't have that many                                 resources to work with                                 other than your your personality and a                                 little bit of overhead to distribute                                 so um i think that's useful background                                 for trying to first get people                                 interested                                 that current administrators interested                                 and to see the value                                 and then also to build up uh a network                                 of enthusiastic proponents besides                                 yourself                                 so the fact that at ubc the the archival                                 scientists are quite excited                                 and scattered people around the                                 university to have them                                 go separately to the vp for research and                                 say hey                                 there's this thing happening we think                                 your office should really get involved                                 that's much more powerful than                                 than i can do on my own so trying to                                 build up this kind of grassroots support                                 and then also connecting a number of                                 those people with the international                                 network that you've been                                 leading is very helpful to see oh this                                 is something that's really                                 moving along and i guess the last point                                 i'll make is that a place like                                 university british columbia                                 has a lot of interaction with a few a                                 few big companies particularly microsoft                                 and and then also some biotech companies                                 and so                                 seeing that what we're proposing is                                 something that's already well                                 established in those                                 partner organizations can be very                                 helpful in terms of getting                                 people to pay attention                                 i like that answer a lot um it makes me                                 curious especially about the                                 stopping duplicative effort and being                                 able to go                                 and say we should do it this way josh at                                 the osi you talk a lot about licensing                                 and                                 most of what we talked about with also                                 so far has been licensing um                                 how do you suggest to people who                                 look at your license list to make sure                                 that they internally use it to actually                                 have a culture collaboration instead of                                 just saying well we used mit because osi                                 said so                                 oh i like this question sorry it's quite                                 tough                                 yeah yeah no it's it's                                 so you're right at osi uh we do                                 we do talk and think a lot about                                 licensing and                                 um just just to to level that for folks                                 osi is the non-profit that stewards the                                 open source definition                                 and maintains the osi approved license                                 list that a lot of organizations                                 governments and companies all around the                                 world sort of rely on by reference                                 the way i like to think about osi is                                 that it does the uh                                 the legal janitorial work that that                                 makes open source predictable                                 for the rest of the world um you know                                 and it's that predictability that's that                                 stability of what open source means                                 that gives us a coherent commons that                                 within that commons                                 we can we can have uh you know as i say                                 permissionless collaboration                                 um that's all well and good but uh                                 but it turns out a better question to                                 save you because osi may not do that                                 outreach week                                 outreach work a better question may be                                 knowing that                                 and knowing what you know from your                                 breath of experience with ospos                                 how would you internally try to use                                 licenses                                 as a way of getting at people to help                                 them actually have a culture of open                                 source beyond the license                                 maybe that's a better question right                                 right because that's sort of that's sort                                 of where i was going is that like we                                 think a lot about licenses but licenses                                 are                                 not the not the the silver bullet                                 they're not the panacea they're not                                 everything and honestly they're just the                                 cornerstone                                 that allows us to build uh you know                                 collaborative environments and build                                 open governance and things like that so                                 it's a it's a precondition                                 but it's really just the one thing                                 and so what i what i encourage people to                                 do is when they're thinking about                                 license choice                                 um think about the kind of community                                 that you're trying to build and what you                                 want your relationship to be with that                                 community                                 right if you are                                 if you are getting into business and you                                 want to sell a product                                 and you're thinking about using a                                 permissive open source license because                                 well that's going to help me get rapid                                 adoption you're probably right it will                                 but if your thought is that your                                 relationship with that community is                                 is to be extractive that like everything                                 you contribute is ours                                 and we're gonna sell that and you know                                 you don't get any of that value back                                 um well you know maybe a permissive                                 license was                                 was was an okay choice from getting                                 adoption                                 but you're really at that point not                                 taking full advantage of what open                                 source has to offer                                 right there's that's not a collaborative                                 environment that's not a thing where                                 there's                                 a whole community of people who have a                                 stake                                 of ownership here and a sense that this                                 is                                 you know how we're going to run the                                 project and i've got some say in that as                                 a member of the community and a                                 contributor                                 so i really just encourage people to                                 think about like what is your                                 relationship to this                                 this project in this community and what                                 do you want that to be                                 and if you want it to be something                                 that's bigger than you                                 then by all means please please pick a                                 uh pick a license that lends itself to                                 that                                 that opens up the possibilities of                                 serendipity because people can adopt it                                 and don't have to worry about uh                                 you know signing your cla or whatever                                 really                                 like licenses are important they're                                 super important but we spend way too                                 much time talking and thinking about                                 them and we should be spending more time                                 thinking about                                 what are we enabling with our licenses                                 what kind of                                 uh development collateral development                                 methodology and what is the governance                                 for how we                                 how we manage those the shared assets                                 that's a really good answer uh thank you                                 steven jacobs you also have to have a                                 lot of work                                 figuring out how to pitch the culture of                                 open source internally because open rit                                 was basically                                 set up by you so how did you do that                                 so it it was set up by me but the                                 exciting thing is                                 there was a lot of interest                                 right away so when i first approached                                 the vice president of research about                                 doing this                                 um you know he said he would                                 i said if i wrote you a white paper                                 would you pass it on to the other folks                                 and he didn't                                 let me finish the sentence he said if i                                 write a white paper he said yes i will                                 pass it on to everybody else so                                 there was interest from him in my                                 provost which for non-university                                 people is essentially like the vice                                 president of the academic side                                 the the president of the university is a                                 fundraiser and the provost is the person                                 who focuses on the content in education                                 and we've been successful in doing a lot                                 around open source education for                                 undergraduates                                 in the                                                                 in open source as a professor                                 and so they charged me to call a meeting                                 when i said i can't call a meeting you                                 guys have to call a meeting nobody                                 there's no university-wide meeting                                 called by professor jacobs right that                                 just doesn't work you guys                                 have to call the meeting but when i sent                                 out the rsvps to see if people wanted to                                 talk about this                                 i expected to see a couple of guys i                                 know from cs and engineering say yeah                                 we're interested                                 and what we got was                                                  different units across                                 campus that said they wanted to learn                                 more they wanted to learn how to                                 participate or so on and so forth so                                 that was                                 really exciting so                                 i spent the fall kind of showing up at                                 all of the official                                 welcome back to the college meetings to                                 tell people what we're doing                                 and thanks to the alfred b sloan                                 foundation i had some great news for                                 them i could say                                 i have a funded internal team that can                                 help you                                 get your project out in the world                                 and start to try to build a community                                 because what happens in open source too                                 often and especially in academic source                                 academic open source is that you know                                 people                                 make their thing toss it into a publicly                                 available repository                                 send out one email and expect like                                 jack's beanstalk it will grow                                 overnight into this beautiful thing and                                 that that just really doesn't happen                                 so i i have been able to tell them look                                 i have a team that's essentially an                                 internal                                 open source digital marketing team for                                 you                                 if you are working with a community                                 that's established                                 but wants some help rebooting itself a                                 little bit                                 or if you're trying to open something on                                 your own                                 that's new i have writers                                 full stack developers and ui ux people                                 who can take on                                 a small amount of projects for the next                                 two years                                 to help you go beyond just that first                                 email                                 repository to really let you build a                                 community                                 from the outside world not just from the                                 inside world and that's                                 that's really powerful and and i can                                 also tell them look this is a you know                                 this team is here now you may just be                                 thinking of something                                 but academics when they write grant                                 proposals or nsf proposals or whatever                                 else have to talk about                                 the sustainability of the project and                                 almost all of the federal agencies and                                 state agencies and a lot of the                                 charitable                                 foundations all say your stuff must be                                 open                                 and what are you going to do when our                                 money runs out                                 and so i i'm telling people who are just                                 starting to look at this stuff look you                                 you should write the team that i have                                 into your proposal as your                                 proof of sustainability and proof of                                 openness you can say we have this unit                                 on campus we'll be working with to go                                 ahead and make sure                                 that we'll be able to reach who we want                                 to reach and that can be a powerful tool                                 i've had one or two people buy into that                                 concept so far we'll see how it goes but                                 that team                                 classes only resumed january                                             that team only started working january                                                                                             to pick out our first cohort of projects                                 so stay tuned                                 but that's what's going on at the moment                                 i wish you the best with that that's                                 awesome                                 um i heard a lot of similarities as a                                 consultant who's helped                                 various companies figure out how to do                                 culture                                 inside their company as well and how to                                 be more open sources not just in the                                 inner source side                                 which is how do you work between teams                                 but how do you actually get people                                 interested in contributing back to open                                 source outside of the company                                 a lot of what you're saying about                                 getting people together and saying we                                 already have this stuff                                 you already do this here this will just                                 magnify it really spoke to me                                 um hong i was wondering if it was the                                 same with you with your work                                 yes so i want to talk a little bit about                                 salando i think it is a good example                                 here                                 is this is a european-based company                                 right and they also                                 one of the biggest like fashion uh                                 platform                                 around when i first started as orlando                                 i want to to say that i chose to work                                 with salando because                                 um i was very impressed by the open                                 source projects that they released                                 on github so they released about                                     different open source projects and some                                 of                                 them being used by our members in the                                 community                                 in asia yeah and they                                 they publish also a lot of process how                                 they work inside orlando                                 um to the outside world and when i still                                 remember when i first                                 the first day when i started at essa                                 lando i got a message from a colleague                                 inside saying that                                 oh it's so welcome on board we actually                                 met uh                                 through your work at fausta so                                 and i realized that when i'm being                                 inside the company i realized there are                                 a lot of                                 individuals who really passionate about                                 the topic and it got something                                 to do with the um the beginning of                                 salando                                 in                                                                    established the platform they actually                                 um built based on an open source um                                 [Music]                                 software that called magento so this is                                 the                                 php um e-commerce platform so entirely                                 open source so from the beginning of the                                 business                                 they already built up on open source and                                  right now magento is not being used                                  anymore so we                                  need new different technologies but it                                  is the core of the london                                  of open source so they understand the                                  importance of contributing back to to                                  the upstream project which is the                                  project that they depend on because                                  if you want to drive a direction of a                                  certain project you you need to show                                  that you contribute                                  yeah in order to have a say in a                                  particular project and                                  when i'm inside the company i realize                                  that the infrastructure the tooling that

the code                                  written inside by any team can be                                  accessed by anyone                                  and there's different groups inside

the event it's easy to share                                  information from within                                  so basically inside we have the common                                  drive

where all the                                  information                                  whatever you want is already there it's                                  very easy                                  and similar to kat mentioned earlier                                  when she                                  explained different activities being                                  done by the expo as google                                  so we also developed something called                                  the open source onboarding so whenever                                  you                                  yeah you're new to zalando i actually                                  wrote this                                  training for for the new um commerce                                  with new colleagues so when they get on                                  board for the first week                                  they join our like tech boot camp and in                                  this bootcamp                                  a very big part of this is open source                                  training so in this trending so we                                  explain the history                                  why we are doing open source um all the                                  benefits and we also                                  mentioned uh when people want to adopt                                  something open source what are the                                  guidelines and we also touch on                                  licensing and legal topic you know                                  so if you adopt something what kind of                                  license on the software that you should                                  use                                  everything that zalando released right                                  now under mit but people also                                  need to understand the different of                                  different licenses                                  and i must say the culture of                                  collaboration actually                                  driven by individuals so that a lot of                                  people within the uh                                  zalando contribute back to upstream                                  project like                                  um portfolio which is uh very uh like                                  being widely used in solano and i'm                                  really glad                                  that not only um it's not that the                                  company said that we must contribute                                  to open source but individual because                                  they come from the open source community                                  they only have the mindset                                  of um sharing and collaboration that is                                  a good thing but to sum up what we want                                  to say is                                  very good infrastructure allowed                                  employees to go and cry on the first day                                  when you join the zolando you only see                                  that                                  the company embrace uh open source by                                  providing training                                  providing tooling that have work                                  yeah i love that answer it's kind of                                  like you don't need to come to church                                  moment if you're all                                  already at church but then how do you                                  make sure people stay there which is                                  great                                  um cat allman i expect you have a                                  similar answer for google you know hey                                  googlers do you                                  like open source encoding well yes we                                  started that way                                  so i i'm going to move on to the next                                  question for you which is how do you                                  take that                                  outwards how do you as an ospo connect                                  to other organizations                                  and academically how do you have google                                  work with universities with academics                                  you're still on mute so while you're                                  unmuting the culture of collaboration is                                  what i'm trying to emphasize here by the                                  way the culture of collaboration                                  um i'm new enough in what i'm doing                                  at google that i'm not the best                                  googler to address how google                                  collaborates with academic institutions                                  we actually have an entire university                                  relations team                                  that are good at that and                                  so can i answer a different question                                  of course you're smarter than i am                                  whatever you want to answer is great                                  please                                  i actually wanted to say um something                                  that i've been thinking about                                  as we are in a global pandemic                                  [Music]                                  i think there's an opportunity for open                                  source to gain                                  new contributors in this time of remote                                  working                                  in this time of job loss                                  and opportunity                                  and frankly need for connection it's                                  great to see you all                                  i wish we were sitting at a table                                  sharing a meal                                  talking in real time everybody out there                                  listening to this                                  you can come too we can all have beer                                  it'll be great                                  because berlin yummy                                  it seems like i mean something i cherish                                  about open source is that sense of                                  connection and community and                                  and in a time where we are denied our                                  regular social things                                  and no longer have to commute many of us                                  there's an opportunity there for open                                  source projects                                  to fill that gap and                                  give people a home and a way to                                  contribute                                  that in turn increases their value in                                  the eyes of                                  employers the missing stare                                  there in academia is we have to figure                                  out a way to get                                  software recognized as a viable research                                  output                                  that applies to ten-year or                                  whatever tenure is going to become                                  but people are working on that we also                                  need to better                                  standardize citations for software                                  again so that software specifically open                                  source can fit into                                  the academic model but i see a lot of                                  opportunity there                                  something i'm excited about with ospos                                  in the academic and commercial setting                                  is how they can normalize the use                                  so hopefully someday we'll all work                                  ourselves out of a job                                  and open source will be the standard                                  and um there won't be a need for                                  specialized education                                  and processes because it'll just be how                                  creation is done maybe i'm optimistic                                  i don't think you're optimistic um or if                                  you are i think it's a good thing i                                  think that's that sounds more realistic                                  actually to me and it actually relates                                  to the question which i was going to ask                                  finally but                                  maybe we could just move right on to it                                  because i think we sort of answered                                  external collaboration anyway                                  um it sounds pretty similar you take                                  internal stuff and you try to get people                                  to work together                                  so instead let's focus on what the                                  future of osbos are                                  um where do we see them going so cat                                  wants this ospos to not exist                                  but that's far down the line there's a                                  future in in the medium time you know                                  getting citations noted for science                                  that's a huge part of open source that                                  the huge area that                                  needs more work and be great to funnel                                  more funding                                  and people who are interested in                                  licensed compliance for that sort of                                  work there that would be excellent                                  uh jonathan fink you work with smart                                  cities not just cities all the cities                                  you work with are smart                                  can you tell us a bit about where you                                  think the future of osbos goes in                                  relation to that                                  sure i think it has to do with what's                                  the future of data for cities                                  and clearly cities have been collecting                                  generating                                  archiving data for a very long time but                                  not                                  necessarily in a well-organized or                                  digital way                                  and so all cities are now grappling with                                  all of the issues associated with                                  privacy and                                  security and and the list goes on and on                                  particularly commercialization so cities                                  are realizing well we have all kinds of                                  very valuable                                  assets here that have not been part of                                  how the city has been organized in the                                  past and we can look                                  to companies to get a sense of how this                                  might work                                  but it's pretty far into the whole                                  purpose of municipal governance which is                                  to provide services                                  to to residents and and so figuring out                                  how                                  all of that works i think and having                                  open source be part of the discussion                                  while that's going on                                  is uh is really important and is a                                  timely                                  opportunity i think many of the cities                                  that i work with all look at toronto                                  and the failure last year of                                  uh sidewalk labs offshoot from from                                  google                                  to basically create one master system                                  for a big development on the waterfront                                  where google or cyberlock lags was going                                  to provide all kinds of services                                  that sounded great and very futuristic                                  in exchange for                                  controlling the data and when the                                  community                                  realized well wait a minute we don't                                  know all the fine print here                                  there's a lot of pushback and the whole                                  thing got cancelled                                  so other cities are saying okay there's                                  a lesson there                                  we need to be thinking about data from                                  the outset and having some tools like                                  what ospos are trying to                                  provide is going to be i think a key                                  part of                                  that discovery                                  stephen jacobs i know you have a thought                                  for this one it seems wrong                                  i i i do have a thought um you know in                                  academia                                  where we're gonna see osbos take off you                                  know everybody's waking up                                  everybody realizes that a lot of the                                  things they have                                  just need to be brought back into one                                  place                                  um so there's there's somebody looking                                  at all the different projects all the                                  different policies it's                                  gathering metrics on because we as                                  universities want to be able to say                                  just like the corporations                                  in open source say you know hey you know                                  our people contributed this much                                  back to the ecosystem right a big                                  problem for universities is                                  we have no idea you know everybody's in                                  their own little box and we have no idea                                  what anybody else is doing so hopefully                                  getting everybody to to sign on for                                  metrics so we can                                  actually share our story with the world                                  like google and other companies do is is                                  one thing i think is a big future                                  um i'm also really fascinated by the                                  the city issue um and what smart cities                                  can do                                  and the challenge that these face we we                                  work somewhat with                                  our um our                                  city's open data portal manager and and                                  our students                                  and a lot of the the challenges that                                  cities have in open data is who really                                  owns their data                                  um because in rochester the school                                  system owns the school's data and the                                  police                                  own their data and a lot of the data                                  that you would think the city would own                                  the county really owns and the county                                  doesn't want to play nice with the city                                  so it's it's a big challenge and i'm                                  looking forward to hopefully as this                                  momentum goes forward                                  those people being able to kind of all                                  come together                                  i know that montgomery county maryland                                  often gets                                  pointed to as a leader in open data and                                  that's                                  something to really take a look at and i                                  always                                  thought that the ownership of data when                                  austin                                  threw out the the ubers and the lifts                                  for the year or whatever it was that                                  they expelled them from the city                                  an independent organizer built an app                                  for the taxis that was an open app and                                  all the data was open                                  um and that's that's a really cool thing                                  seeing more of that                                  happen would be amazing um the                                  equivalence                                  to on campus is you know how do we what                                  do we do with the data that we own                                  on our employees and how can we use that                                  to make their jobs                                  easier better how can we benefit our                                  students with what we know                                  those those are the things that i really                                  see us getting a handle on                                  in the next                                                            being able to to lift up the work that                                  we do                                  josh where do you see                                  all's pose going in this vein                                  i think you know over the last                                                                                                           an official uh definition for open                                  source                                  you know we've seen                                  a journey among institutions                                  of various types you know academic and                                  corporate and otherwise                                  where people organizations have gone                                  from uh                                  outright hostile to open source and                                  that that approach to collaboration and                                  intellectual property                                  to uh be grudging acceptance                                  where it's like well i guess we've got                                  linux machines running in this                                  this operation what are we gonna do um                                  to to an appreciation of the fact that                                  uh open source means we can build                                  more better faster                                  and i think we're                                  we're getting up to a point where                                  we're seeing organizations who have been                                  on this journey for long enough                                  to start to realize                                  the full potential of what open source                                  can bring                                  which is that it's not just about                                  this these these free as in beer assets                                  it's about the serendipity and the                                  unexpected benefits that you get                                  out of collaborating across borders that                                  would have typically divided us                                  and i think we're seeing organizations                                  begin to understand how to work with                                  that and begin to think a little bit                                  bigger                                  and so what i see in the future of open                                  source programs offices and of course                                  everybody's on a different on on on                                  roughly the same journey but at                                  different                                  you know different pace so you know                                  there's a bell curve here                                  but i think what we're going to see is                                  more organizations the standard                                  being not just let's manage our open                                  source                                  to minimize our liability and our risk                                  and and ship faster but like                                  no this is this is a fundamentally                                  different way of thinking about working                                  with each other and producing value for                                  the world at large                                  and so i think um                                  i think the future of ospose is is                                  moving from the sort of table stakes of                                  management                                  um to to sort of strategic thinking of                                  like well                                  no this is this is a core rethinking of                                  of what we're doing and we should this                                  should be                                  weaved into basically everything else we                                  do in our business or our organization                                  because there's just there's so much                                  potential when we do that                                  at the open source business alliance at                                  fosasia you've                                  actually encapsulated a lot of what we                                  talked about with collaboration because                                  you're not just working at the one                                  company                                  right zolando is great and they're doing                                  awesome open source stuff and you're                                  helping with that but you're also                                  helping out at a larger scale                                  josh just mentioned borderless                                  collaboration and so i wanted to hear                                  from you                                  what do you think the future of osbos                                  might be in                                  the terms of how that works yes so thank                                  you for mentioning open source business                                  alliance so i just want to say that they                                  are doing                                  great work if you are in europe uh i                                  highly recommend you to check them out                                  yes the future of osbo                                  i don't want to say that i want to say                                  can what uh                                  kat said earlier so do we really need an                                  hospital in the future it should be a                                  normal way of working so do we need open                                  source                                  open source program offers in order to                                  collaborate or to do open source                                  yeah so um so i think um                                  i don't want uh us to buy in into any                                  terminology so is it like now people                                  have the feeling that okay we                                  start now should have a hospital                                  everyone should have an hospital                                  uh to do open source right so it's about                                  collaboration it's about                                  um working with the community                                  contribution into uh contributing to                                  different uh                                  projects so you can do it even without                                  the hospital so individual can do that                                  to do this and for in when you talk                                  about academia as                                  jonathan mentioned earlier so there is a                                  need of having an                                  entity in order to to face with the                                  outside world to to receive funding or                                  to access some                                  um like process of procedure of course                                  then it's always good to have an entity                                  uh to emphasize the open source effort                                  but um what i'm saying is whatever you                                  do whatever this situation that you make                                  do open source is a core you need a way                                  to governance to manage but                                  it doesn't need to be hospitable uh it                                  could be uh                                  like collaboration with the community                                  work with people who actually know who                                  actually do                                  open source yeah so some companies                                  haven't asked for because they don't                                  have                                  um a clear understanding what needs to                                  be done so they have uh                                  some uh funding and they said okay so                                  seen and we are doing it let's do this                                  but but my suggestion would be                                  uh look into the community connect with                                  people actually doing open source and                                  work together with them                                  and the decision whether you need an                                  office or you need a team you need a                                  project management or not is up to you                                  not the same for um for everyone                                  yeah i love that answer thank you so                                  much um                                  cat i want to make sure you had an                                  opportunity you started this                                  conversation by bringing up the fact                                  that right now is a great time for us to                                  collaborate together seeing as how we're                                  all working from home due to global                                  pandemic                                  which is not fun to mention but it's                                  it's true that this is a good point                                  um do you have anything else you want to                                  say about the future of open source                                  program offices and working together                                  looping back to the academic                                  to illustrate with a story i last year                                  was                                  talking with a major research biological                                  research center                                  in the u.s that all their research                                  is open source all their researchers                                  do that by default and much to my                                  surprise                                  and theirs their legal department didn't                                  know that                                  so i think this speaks to                                  i think this speaks to the need for                                  internal uh coordination and education                                  about um as many of you have said                                  we need to train people that it's not                                  scary that it's actually a good way of                                  working                                  and then align the incentives in                                  academia and industry to support                                  collaboration instead of working against                                  it                                  i agree again it's very easy to agree                                  with friends who are right                                  so i just do a lot of that so thank you                                  all so much                                  um before we wrap up and move on to                                  questions and audience if you have any                                  questions please put them in the                                  question tab or just directly in the                                  comments i can read that too and i'll                                  field them to our wonderful panelists                                  today who've really                                  gone out of their way to show how                                  awesome open source can be and how                                  awesome they are                                  without doing that selfishly they just                                  do it naturally it exudes                                  so one question i have is what do you                                  want the audience to know what do you                                  feel like we didn't get covered we don't                                  have a ton of time but hopefully                                  a point each might work steven jacobs                                  you always have something what do you                                  think                                  um                                  universities are great places to kind of                                  forge the open ethics since academics                                  and researchers                                  are by the hundreds of years of the                                  scientific method                                  kind of ingrained to share their work                                  and i think it's really gonna kind of                                  move forward well                                  as people start to look forward to                                  getting involved                                  thank you so much josh simmons                                  i think if there's one thing i want to                                  leave i want to leave the audience with                                  it's uh                                  it's the sense that that that you                                  are the future of open source right

                 this                                  little presentation it was really great                                  to have you all uh we do have some                                  questions                                  so before we all leave and end here um                                  i'm going to ask a question from the                                  crowd if that is all right                                  what are the ways that foss foundations                                  are hosting organizations                                  i.e non-profits or community groups can                                  best explain their work and expectations                                  to help osbos be more effective                                  within their own big core for academic                                  organizations                                  it's a great question who would like to                                  field this                                  um so we're just getting started                                  but um you know it's it's been                                  said that um open source                                  works due to enlightened self-interest                                  that's a denise cooper quote right and                                  so you know                                  getting people to understand what what                                  the benefits are to them as to why they                                  would do this                                  right there's there's intrinsic and                                  extrinsic motivation how do you get the                                  people in your organization to do that                                  um as i said we're trying                                  see me in a year we'll let you know                                  whether people actually bought it or not                                  but it's it's all about                                  what can i do for you and what can you                                  do for me right and that's not                                  necessarily a bad thing                                  you
