of open                               strategy partners                               and i'd like to talk to you today about                               trust                               the                                                                   and also build better businesses and                                better communities                                [Music]                                osp was born out of some conversations                                and strong ideas about communication                                that has now become our communication                                model which underpins everything we do                                and it's called authentic communication                                and it's based on                                three elements that we see here empathy                                clarity                                and trust um and so                                based on that i naturally gravitate                                towards any material written                                on these topics and i got the                                inspiration                                for this talk from a book written by                                canada's former governor general                                david johnston uh the book was called uh                                trust                                                                                                    and in this book he uh he implores us                                to see that trust is gained through our                                actions and decisions                                on our doing and not merely saying on                                the basis that can be observed and                                measured rationally                                as a quote from the book and he really                                wants us to                                explore the attitudes habits and                                approaches that people                                that make people businesses                                organizations and countries                                uh trustworthy and it was really                                interesting and                                i highly recommend the book um                                so in this talk i'd like to share with                                you ten very practical tips um to                                mindfully build stress                                trust not stress uh trust into your                                communications                                and also to make the argument that if we                                put actions like these                                at the core of how we communicate that                                we can build better                                connections businesses and communities                                um so let's step back for a second                                and think about why trust actually                                matters                                and my theory or philosophy is that                                more and more people are making                                values-based decisions                                including but especially around where                                they work                                where they contribute and definitely                                what tools and services                                they use or support um                                and i would argue that trust is one of                                the most important underlying values                                that influence peop                                people's choices and for people to                                engage with your company your project                                your product                                they need to connect with you and to do                                that they need trust                                so what is trust um of course we                                uh need the oxford definition of trust                                and that's                                um the firm belief in the reliability                                truth or ability of someone or something                                um but actually it's far more                                complicated than that um that's a really                                simplistic view                                trust is an often overlooked phenomenon                                but it's an important one that's worth                                deeper consideration                                in my opinion trust is especially                                important in how we communicate the                                value                                of open source technology products and                                services                                the value of which is highly complex and                                often abstract                                and where the story around a given set                                of features and benefits can be told                                in a multitude of ways um                                that's a really important view to have                                um so i really like stephen covey's                                model of trust                                to me it stands the test of time and it                                fits very well                                 with open source technology products and                                 services                                 when we look at his model we can see                                 that it breaks down into                                 two main categories competence and                                 character and                                 on the competent side it solves the                                 questions uh things like                                 can you solve my problem can you solve                                 it better than any alternative                                 and can i expect a high level of                                 knowledge and experience to be baked                                 into your product or service                                 um and then over on the character side                                 um it looks more at things like you know                                 do your values                                 align with mine and                                 this question i'd like to break this                                 down into three different types of                                 values                                 those being moral technical and                                 business values so for example with                                 moral values                                 the question can be do they source their                                 materials in a sustainable way                                 do they pay fair wages do they have a                                 diverse recruiting culture                                 on technical values it could be things                                 like                                 do they and how do they use open source                                 and open standards does it align with                                 the way that we use it                                 um do they treat users data with respect                                 uh did they use devops practices um to                                 get highly technical                                 um uh on the third type of value the                                 business values it can answer things                                 like                                 is your business model competitive is it                                 transparent is it fair                                 um and do you communicate in an open                                 and authentic way um this sort of                                 structured                                 catalog of questions is something that                                 you should be visiting at both the                                 strategic level                                 as well as the content production level                                 um                                 this should really come through in both                                 of those practices                                 um so the domains where trust matters                                 most                                 might be domains that you happen to                                 overlook um                                 we need to bring trust into our                                 communication in all of these domains up                                 here so                                 support and interaction training                                 technical documentation                                 product communication things like                                 product pages data sheets demos                                 and of course editorial communication                                 like blogs social pr                                 so getting down to business let's dive                                 into                                 the                                                           is be technically accurate always                                 a simple straightforward way to ensure                                 technical accuracy                                 is to interview the expert and if needed                                 ask them to review your work                                 this is especially important for                                 marketers and technical writers who may                                 not                                 have the depth of knowledge um that the                                 developers do                                 for example                                 way number two um be precise in your                                 language                                 and use zero hyperbole avoid things like                                 best in class only solution that                                 or overusing the word innovation happens                                 a lot                                 never say it's the only uh x you'll ever                                 need                                 or or uh claiming that one technology                                 will solve                                 all of your problems um so avoid things                                 like that                                 and it's not only that these statements                                 are inaccurate they're also not helpful                                 uh they're so broad that it doesn't give                                 the reader                                 a clear picture of the value that you                                 can actually deliver them                                 way number three keep your writing tight                                 too much noise around what really needs                                 to be communicated dampens the trust                                 that we can build                                 crisp sharp focused communication                                 however gives us the clarity that we                                 spoke of earlier                                 way number four um a clear narrative                                 structure                                 um and this is similar to tight writing                                 in that it provides clarity                                 but it does so by taking the reader in                                 hand and essentially leading them down                                 a clear path                                 way number five so an easy to navigate                                 informational structure                                 makes the journey easy and flexible for                                 your reader it                                 allows them to choose their own                                 adventure and consume the bits of                                 information that's                                 most relevant to them we do this                                 with things like descriptive headlines                                 breaking down                                 breaking the text down to smaller                                 paragraphs that are easy to scan                                 using bullet points and other formatting                                 to call out the important bits                                 and this is uh this is really                                 important for trust                                 and way number six is                                 always use uh logical rigor                                 and of course avoiding logical fallacies                                 and um i'd like to take just a minute                                 here                                 to uh to provide a few examples                                 um of logical fallacies                                 first one being over generalization                                 so the writer bases the argument on                                 insufficient evidence the writer                                 draws a larger conclusion than the                                 evidence supports                                 and so if you are claiming that cms                                 a is better than cms is a better cms                                 you would need to do fairly exhaustive                                 research and comparison                                 with object objective standards and                                 unbiased results to warrant that claim                                 you can however talk about a specific                                 set of functionality that                                 supports a particular use case that you                                 haven't seen anywhere else                                 that's perfectly valid                                 the second logical fallacy that i want                                 to share is                                 a non-sequitur or it doesn't follow                                 meaning so this is where the writer's                                 conclusion is not                                 necessarily a logical result of the                                 facts                                 for example super simple example stating                                 that because cms                                 a has more functions it's a better cms                                 than cmsb obviously more doesn't equal                                 better                                 a third one that we have is begging the                                 question                                 so the writer presents as truth what is                                 not yet proven by the argument                                 so before an argument on a topic can be                                 made or a solution offered                                 the reader must be convinced that there                                 is a problem                                 and the last example that i'll share                                 with you is called the red herring                                 this is where the writer introduces a                                 completely irrelevant point                                 simply to divert the reader's attention                                 from the main issue                                 and you may do this unconsciously so                                 in reviewing your writing and reasoning                                 make sure that you examine                                 the suppositions and the conclusions                                 you've made and make sure that you are                                 not                                 making diversionary or non-relevant                                 points to support your argument                                 and a concrete example would be citing                                 sales figures to show that one cmsa                                 so to showing that cmsa has a higher                                 has higher sales than cmsb this doesn't                                 prove that cms                                 a is a better platform than cmsb                                 for a given set of needs                                 way way number seven so                                 making so make mindful claims by                                 avoiding things like                                 binary claims which is you know stating                                 that something is good or bad um or                                 absolute claims meaning best worst and                                 things like that                                 um and certainly avoid negativity                                 um it's it's better to respect the                                 the nuance and the situations where your                                 product may not actually be the best fit                                 um and using fud or fear uncertainty and                                 doubt                                 um in our communication um                                 and diminishing the value of the                                 competitor doesn't help us build trust                                 um it's quite the opposite so focus on                                 what value you                                 deliver and not what the competition                                 doesn't                                 this doesn't mean that you shouldn't do                                 comparisons                                 um just don't do don't use it to paint                                 the competition in                                 into an especially bad light                                 so um way number eight                                 is backing up your claims with evidence                                 and so uh we have a couple of different                                 different types of                                 different types of evidence so we have                                 quantitative evidence which is things                                 like statistics                                 industry reports other research                                 we have case studies with quantifiable                                 outcomes                                 and if we want to look at qualitative                                 evidence which is                                 um something that we see a lot of                                 that's things like expert claims                                 testimonials                                 anecdotal stories for examples                                 and case studies with qualitative                                 outcomes                                 and backing up a benefit claim by                                 explaining                                 how the product is actually built to                                 support that benefit                                 um our product provides xbenefit because                                 it's built containing                                 yz features that also helps back up your                                 claim                                 um and following on that is also                                 documentation                                 so the other thing that we want to do                                 when we think about                                 um claims uh or                                 backing up our claims with evidence um                                 is looking at the                                 quality of the evidence and so it's                                 important to ask ourselves                                 is each piece of evidence in the in the                                 content piece is it                                 valid is it relevant is it unique                                 um and is the evidence                                 um is the evidence directly connected                                 with a cause and effect                                 relationship to the claim so um                                 and we can absolutely make emotional                                 claims without                                 evidence when appropriate especially                                 when quoting somebody else                                 um for example uh making a statement                                 like                                 by working together we make something                                 greater than the sum of its parts                                 um that's perfectly valid                                 uh                                 way number nine um                                 speak from or reference an authoritative                                 voice                                 um the if the authoritative voice might                                 be                                 your internal technical expert it might                                 be a community-based expert                                 you can also reference research from a                                 trusted source                                 to have that authoritative voice                                 so and uh last but not least way number                                 ten                                 uh recognize and acknowledge others for                                 their expertise                                 and knowledge uh contributions and                                 competitive                                 offerings this is something that open                                 source communities tend to do quite well                                 actually and and it's a very important                                 factor in building trust                                 oh there we go                                 um so um i believe that these actions                                 and ways of communicate of communicating                                 lead to more trust                                 and more trust equals more connection                                 and more connection                                 equals happier people stronger                                 communities and better businesses                                 my hope is that trust infused                                 communication becomes more and more                                 the norm and i also believe that                                 this will make the world a better place                                 and                                 i believe that the open source                                 communities can play a leading role in                                 this                                 so                                 i think that was the next one so                                 sources for all the beautiful images of                                 course came from                                 unsplash and                                 that's everything so thank you so much                                 for your time and i'm ready

some questions                                 if you're ready tracy i am i'm trying to                                 click over to the stream yard                                 tab but uh it's okay i'm i'm watching                                 that so i'll let you know you're getting                                 a few hearts right now                                 so great people okay there's no                                 questions as of yet okay um                                 okay cool thank you yeah                                 so one question i had was you talk about                                 speaking from an authoritative voice                                 yeah and in open source i increasingly                                 see                                 with small projects this is really easy                                 you know if it's a small module and                                 there's one person then all the docs                                 come from them                                 yeah but with larger projects i often                                 find that                                 things tend to devolve until you have                                 this sort of vanilla                                 marketing normal technical documentation                                 speak where there's no real person                                 behind it and so the authoritative voice                                 becomes                                 the voice of the project itself in a way                                 yeah                                 how do you do uh do you                                 advise people to try to put more quotes                                 from maintainers or something                                 how do you try to make it not so vanilla                                 but also                                 more authoritative and and more relevant                                 to people and more                                 personal for larger docs yeah                                 um and i think part of the answer was                                 actually formulated in your question                                 um it i started begging the question                                 shouldn't have done that you mentioned                                 that in number five                                 um uh no i think that it's                                 um i think it is important to not just                                 have                                 um sort of a vanilla project voice of                                 course you want some consistency                                 um and you want some sort of uh                                 consistent style of voice um but                                 it's also really important to highlight                                 uh the people behind the technology                                 and so the contributors and the                                 maintainers um it's important that they                                 have                                 a voice and that they're represented um                                 in                                 all of the different types of                                 communication um                                 in any open source technology um and                                 including documentation um and                                 you know it's i think it's really                                 helpful for people when they come                                 to consume any of that content if they                                 start to see                                 um some names and get to know who are                                 the main players                                 in the community that can also be quite                                 motivating                                 for um for them to make their own                                 contribution as well and to participate                                 and                                 so i think um i think we should                                 encourage uh highlighting                                 um the the community's voice                                 contributors and maintainers yeah                                 i like that answer thank you so much um                                 one question another question i have is                                 for readmes for again for small projects                                 um because for much larger ones there's                                 often someone who thinks about these                                 things but for                                 maintainers out there how do you                                 expect people to build a narrative when                                 really it's just description install                                 usage license contribute and how do you                                 build a narrative through your                                 documentation do you have any                                 suggestions                                 oh that's a that's a very good question                                 and a very tricky one to                                 to answer um i                                 think that you can build a narrative um                                 across your documentation by                                 um tying all of the the                                 feature and benefit stories um together                                 and weaving those throughout your                                 documentation                                 and for any given piece like the readme                                 file                                 of course there's like you know the the                                 specific elements that people are                                 expecting                                 but there's no reason why you can't put                                 a little bit of context or a little bit                                 of backstory                                 at the beginning or the end of the                                 document to help                                 tie that narrative across the whole                                 all of the technical documentation                                 that's a good answer thank you by the                                 way we've lost your video i don't know                                 if that was intentional                                 but no um okay i just want to let you                                 know                                 again if anyone has any questions feel                                 free to drop them in the chat                                 i'm very happy to talk about this topic                                 because i i really love it so i have                                 some more going on um                                 how would you like to speak to                                 policymakers with the ability to provide                                 funding yes                                 this was an interesting question i had                                 from the very beginning so you say                                 things like don't use the word                                 innovative too much you know avoid                                 buzzwords                                 right what happens when an open source                                 project                                 needs to talk to people who use those                                 languages to speak to their constituents                                 i'd say if you need funders or you need                                 policy makers they want those words                                 yeah they really do they really really                                 do                                 oh and there is no perfect answer to                                 this um                                 so just to set that up from the                                 beginning                                 um i                                 i think there are some careful language                                 choices that you can make                                 um where you you can get around                                 um not using those buzzwords or not                                 using them so often                                 um or um                                 explaining them in a little bit more                                 depth                                 and um you know a little bit more of a                                 concrete                                 background um so if you're gonna use                                 a word like innovative of course it's                                 not you know we don't have to completely                                 eliminate that um from our vocabulary                                 um but we should explain how we're                                 innovative how are you actually                                 different                                 um because the point about not using                                 buzzwords is not                                 is to eliminate the expectation that                                 just using these words at a high level                                 is going to solve um you know it's gonna                                 give them the understanding and the                                 impression that that will have what they                                 need                                 um and so as long as we                                 back up those specific claims                                 um or back up using those words with                                 um a concrete explanation um i think                                 that's                                 that might be the happy path                                 so that brings me to my next question                                 and again if you have any other                                 questions feel free to drop them in the                                 chat or the questions bar for those who                                 miss me saying that the first two times                                 um you talk about backing it up so a lot                                 of trust isn't just using language but                                 being able to actually                                 embody the language that you use                                 how do you publicly in the open                                 manage expectations with people who                                 now have the explanation that you will                                 back it up where do you do you have any                                 tools you suggest for                                 for keeping a list of things that you've                                 promised or for making sure that                                 everyone knows like that that you're                                 that's more of a project management                                 project management question i just                                 wonder like                                 on the back end how do you make sure                                 that you always fulfill everything that                                 you say in your docs                                 um actually we have a very specific tool                                 for this                                 and we call it the value map um i don't                                 know that anybody else                                 um uses something like this but                                 essentially                                 it's um a tool where we collect                                 an inventory of every single feature and                                 benefit                                 that a particular piece of software has                                 and we make sure that we that the                                 inventory is                                 complete and we make sure that it's in                                 the language                                 um following the principles that we                                 believe in and what we've just                                 discussed and all of                                 the um marketing communications or                                 technical communications                                 that are built they're built upon that                                 value map                                 so it comes from like this concrete                                 structure um so                                 that's essentially how we really um                                 approach that                                 issue that's really fascinating i would                                 love to see one of those                                 in action um what sort of people's open                                 strategy partner                                 normally work with what sort of                                 organizations what size                                 um size ranges um we work with                                 um small and medium-sized technical                                 agencies but we also work                                 with um large associations                                 and companies we operate                                 almost exclusively in in the open source                                 space                                 and we have um so for example we work                                 with                                 a type of three the association as well                                 as the commercial arm the gmbh                                 and an agency within uh within that                                 community                                 we also are quite active in the uh                                 drupal                                 community um and uh                                 and yeah essentially we love uh                                 technology and                                 especially open source is our home base                                 so you work with with large communities                                 i mean drupal's huge and that's great                                 um yeah how do you get values from large                                 communities you use questionnaires you                                 use surveys what do you do                                 um that that is a                                 fascinating question and um the drupal                                 community is actually a really great                                 um example where they've gone through um                                 several                                 iterations and effort around building                                 their                                 values and something that we do actually                                 with our                                 clients at a smaller level is help them                                 identify their values so that they can                                 bring out the right character and tone                                 in their communication                                 um and there's several different                                 schools of thought um about how to build                                 build values so there's um there's an                                 inclusive approach                                 where you might survey the community                                 find out their feedback                                 collect that aggregate it sort it out                                 and then                                 articulate them based on that and                                 there's another school                                 of thought which is that the leadership                                 alone                                 um should try to develop these um                                 these values and um                                 the drupal community actually did a                                 hybrid                                 of these two solutions so it was                                 essentially the                                 the leadership team in the association                                 with an external consultant                                 that worked on their latest version of                                 their values um                                 which are very they're the best                                 articulated values i've seen so i'd                                 encourage people to check them out um                                 and the way that they went about doing                                 this in a hybrid way                                 is that they uh i believe they did                                 interview                                 some key people within the community and                                 got their                                 input um and then i believe they went                                 away on an executive retreat and                                 you know worked through them and                                 articulated them                                 from there which is a great approach                                 yeah that sounds excellent um and i                                 think given the                                                        that would also really really help                                 starting with the value chain then going                                 forward and saying does this                                 documentation match these things are we                                 being                                 honest forthright using the right words                                 putting our money where a mouse is this                                 is this is great stuff thank you so much                                 i really appreciate it                                 you
