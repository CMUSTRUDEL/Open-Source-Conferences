Title: #FOSSBack: Kenneth Frantzen - How to infect and indoctrinate todays youth in the ways of FOSS!
Publication date: 2021-02-23
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	We all wish for the up and coming young generation to get thoroughly and completely immersed in the world of FOSS. They should eat, drink and breath it to become good and loyal members of the community.

But... many of them do not even know that FOSS exists. Their eyes never leave the smartphone screens and they dream of Microsoft Windows, Adobe Photoshop, Apple iPhone and Xbox. So how do we enlighten them? How to we let the everloving glow of FOSS reach in to their dark and dreary lives?

As a teacher in Web development for students who aim to become engineers ("Gymnasieingenjör i Mjukvaruutveckling"), I teach them how modern software development is steeped in FOSS philosophy and try to show them all the posibilitys that rise from the community.  This is a short insight in how FOSS can (and should) be a big part of secondary education in Sweden.

                 i work as a web development teacher                                so i and i worked as a web developer                                before                                but now i mainly teach and it's on the                                west coast of sweden                                and my students they can become anything                                from                                software engineers to web developers or                                network technicians and                                you might have heard my voice before                                perhaps                                i've been on a few podcasts like hacker                                public radio                                or all in it radio                                or maybe not well                                the thing about youth                                i mean we are in the open source                                community                                the free and open source community we                                have sort of                                built in this idea of propagating                                our beliefs and we like to talk about                                what we're interested in we                                enjoy spreading the word as it were                                about what we do and why we do it                                and somehow we                                often get our kids if we are                                old enough to have kids or perhaps                                our acquaintances involved in some way                                or another                                and that is true even though the thing                                that we are talking about                                is some what i shouldn't say inherently                                boring but                                i mean we we are talking about code and                                licensing of code here                                it isn't the most spectacular and most                                interesting of fields                                however you look at it                                but it is a very effective way                                to produce and                                govern software                                and that is something we have discovered                                and that is something we believe in                                so as a teacher                                i                                i have sort of a a responsibility                                to to give this knowledge to uh                                others right i should have switched the                                image here                                the image you see here is from a drupal                                camp                                in gothenburg where i live and                                you can find me on this picture if you                                look                                at the lower left part                                in the firefox t-shirt behind a balloon                                that is me and the one actually                                who posted this picture is the man on                                 the top left                                 olamia verchon who who got this                                 conference together uh drupal camp and                                 drupal is                                 as i guess many of you know a                                 cms content management system which is                                 very                                 popular it's one of the greatest ones                                 most used after of course number one                                 which is a wordpress                                 so i've been involved in such                                 conferences as well                                 and i try to take                                 in when i have older pupils students                                 i try to bring them to these conferences                                 if possible                                 and it is a good way to                                 make them see and make them appreciate                                 that what i say isn't the only                                 voice that says this because                                 when you are in a classroom situation it                                 it                                 it sort of becomes the teacher saying                                 something and the pupils the students                                 listening and shrugging just thinking                                 that yeah well that's what he says                                 and of course that is not how education                                 should be                                 we me and my colleagues we try all the                                 time to                                 integrate our education with                                 conference talks like this one                                 to show the pupils show the students                                 that                                 we are a part of                                 a global movement and there are a lot of                                 people that actually think this is                                 important                                 all right but still it's not easy to                                 reach students                                 they are in sort of a                                 troublesome position they are                                 surrounded by a lot of people and a lot                                 of organizations                                 that is not really interested in free                                 and open source software                                 and if we just give an                                 eye to what sort of companies they are                                 surrounded by                                 well we have this famous example                                 microsoft who went from saying that                                 linux is a cancer and open source                                 software is                                 communism and a threat to society                                 under steve bahmer as ceo of microsoft                                 to what we hear now recently where                                 as well the ceo microsoft but now satya                                 nadella                                 says that we are all in on open source                                 so they have made a change                                 they have made an image change and                                 an idea change which is mainly                                 governed by their need to                                 embrace open source or go under                                 to be be totally frank because they                                 are seeing themselves more and more as a                                 cloud company as does many other                                 companies                                 the internet has really changed                                 the way that companies reach their                                 customers                                 so being a cloud company you cannot                                 ignore                                 open source because foss is what built                                 the internet it's what it's built on                                 and no matter how you think about it you                                 can't                                 escape that but even though                                 a large company like microsoft can                                 have these                                 ideas and intentions which so far seems                                 well meant and they actually do                                 contribute to                                 the foss community today                                 which is very nice to see but but still                                 that is something that occurs on a plane                                 on and on a horizon which                                 my students never reach or never see                                 it doesn't affect them because                                 the software that runs in these clouds                                 and                                 the software that they run                                 isn't really in any way                                 or form um affected by this                                 i mean if they buy a new xbox what does                                 that say about free and open source                                 i'm certain there are some free and open                                 source                                 in the xbox and there probably are some                                 documentation                                 that recites the gpl somewhere                                 but the                                                               that game system                                 probably doesn't know or care either                                 so this is what the companies they are                                 surrounded by are like and                                 we have a situation where                                 well it's the law of the lee or of least                                 resistance                                 i mean adobe adobe photoshop is                                 equivalent to editing pictures                                 but it shouldn't have to be                                 and a large part of that is                                 not only that adobe is good at making                                 themselves known in the public but also                                 that                                 the alternatives are not known by those                                 who should                                 teach the alternatives                                 so students they know what                                 the latest coolest most expensive things                                 are and they want them they want to be                                 cool in the eyes of their peers                                 and who who doesn't really                                 okay so so that is the corporate side of                                 things                                 what actually influences students that                                 way but                                 what does the government think how does                                 the government                                 approach free and open source software                                 in relation to education in sweden                                 well there are things being said from                                 time to time                                 in the latest                                                            up                                 thoughts and ideas about                                 implementing more force in                                 the way that the country is governed                                 and how the schools operate                                 and we have a copy of a couple of quotes                                 here on                                 screen you see they started                                 an organization the government started                                 an organization which had                                 impart the mandate to                                 strive for public administration as far                                 as possible                                 to build its solutions on open standards                                 use open source software and so on                                 so so that has actually been written                                 from the government on official paper                                 and                                 uh well stuff happened with that                                 organization but                                 that is neither here nor there and if                                 you read                                 the instructions given by the government                                 for the secondary educational system in                                 sweden                                 it says actually what you see in the                                 second quote here                                 that the school should be open to                                 different ideas and encourage                                 their expression it should emphasize the                                 importance of forming personal views                                 and provide opportunities for doing this                                 it is also a strong                                 you can find strong wording for                                 democracy and uh                                 ethical thinking ethical reflections                                 about how what you                                 learn as a student how that affects                                 the rest of the country and the rest of                                 the world                                 our fellow human beings and                                 in that sure it's not really                                 directly related to free and open source                                 but still                                 in that you can find the idea of foss                                 actually quite snugly making its place                                 and especially since we                                 have sort of the situation where it's                                 not even mentioned at all                                 so it absolutely there is room                                 for free and open source uh and if you                                 just mentioned quickly about how                                 the swedish educational system is uh                                 built the if you are                                 somewhat involved in education anywhere                                 in the world you probably                                 recognize a few of these um ideas and                                 the way this is organized but                                 the main thing for you to to take from                                 this is that you have compulsory school                                 that is uh nine years                                 and that is from ages seven to fifteen                                 and then you have upper secondary school                                 which isn't compulsory                                 but most actually                                 do continues to study and that is                                                                                       and after that you go on to university                                 or                                 some other higher vocational education                                 and that could be                                 i mean two years to become a network                                 technician or                                 three years to become a network engineer                                 or                                 anything in there between so                                 i am situated in the middle of this                                 map in upper secondary school                                 in sweden it's called gymnosiet and it's                                 actually a name derived from a gymnasium                                 but it's the original meaning of the                                 word                                 so up under secondary school ages                                 say                                          that is the late teens students are                                 discovering the world in a way that they                                 haven't done                                 earlier in their education                                 and these three years they have the                                 possibility to                                 choose what kind of education they want                                 so we have                                                                                                   programs or or education that they can                                 choose between                                 and i i teach on one of those                                 programs so i'm teaching mainly as i                                 mentioned web development                                 all right so the government has made it                                 possible                                 to teach about free and open source                                 in the upper secondary school there are                                 room for that and there are                                 possibilities to talk about it                                 if you look at stuff like um                                 the curriculum for the individual                                 courses                                 but it is the municipalities that                                 actually                                 are behind and sponsor and                                 take care of the these schools                                 so we have                                                              who try to do their best and                                 each municipality buy their own software                                 and that is software from the cloud like                                 if we talk about the student platforms                                 learning platforms                                 but also what computers should be bought                                 and what software should be on them so                                 that isn't the best idea                                 because you don't have the competence                                 in most many municipalities to                                 do to                                 find good software                                 rather you hear something from                                 your friend on the golf course from the                                 next municipality over and then you go                                 with what he                                 says so we are have been stuck with a                                 lot of                                 bad software through the years and a lot                                 of                                 the reason for that is that the                                 municipalities                                 doesn't have the competence as the                                 scientist                                 mentions in the quote here that i found                                 in a magazine just last week                                 teachers are if it's like hurting cats                                 to                                 administer programmers well                                 it's like hurting kittens i don't know                                 what's worse actually                                 because teachers are so set in their                                 ways                                                                                 made a                                 we tried to implement open office at                                 our school and the idea was that well                                 we have a lot of money to save going                                 from microsoft office                                 and they actually went                                 as far as rolling out open office on all                                 the pupils                                 computers but not on the teacher's                                 computers                                 why well because a handful of teachers                                 had some excel sheets                                 with some sort of programming                                 in them that they had used for                                          and they would never under any                                 circumstances                                 be able to translate that to                                 open office and since they didn't have                                 the same functionality and the                                 differences that                                 microsoft implemented there were so                                 many problems with the students and the                                 teachers not having the same software                                 that the next year they rolled out                                 microsoft office again                                 but it's not hopeless i mean we had                                 the pandemic now and from one day to the                                 other                                 almost all teachers seamlessly                                 went over to teaching their                                 courses via zoom or                                 teams or whatever with the kids being                                 home                                 and so there is a possibility for                                 change but it's hard to see what                                 makes it possible                                 so how do how do we in this                                 environment approach this then                                 well the we these are two of my closest                                 colleagues                                 on the screen and we talk a lot about                                 how to get these students who                                 have never even thought about licensing                                 before                                 how to get them to understand foss in a                                 good way                                 and the first year when they arrive we                                 don't get in touch with them that much                                 because neither one of us have                                 any courses with the first years                                 unfortunately                                 but the library                                 at our school does a good job of                                 introducing creative commons                                 to them so the library visits                                 all the classes in year one and they                                 explain how creative commons works and                                 how do you how you find                                 works that are released under such a                                 license                                 so that is a first taste of it                                 and then in second year then they come                                 to me and                                 and study the course web development one                                 and also a base                                 a primary basic computer course                                 like this is a screen this is a                                 processor this is                                 this is what makes up a computer etc                                 and then we really try to give them                                 as much as they can handle from the                                 start so we actually begin                                 with how to become a hacker by uh                                 esr and talk about the hacker ethos and                                 what's what what started and what                                 was the foundation for what later become                                 the                                 the first movement and this idea                                 that you shouldn't reinvent the wheel                                 and                                 it's always better if we actually                                 collaborate                                 to create software and which                                 has been proven by now you would think                                 that                                 it is actually a better way to produce                                 software                                 and this we introduced them to as well                                 as                                 great examples of software being                                 developed that way like                                 inkscape and virtualbox                                      we talk a bit about linux as well as the                                 css                                 framework bootstrap but then we really                                 dive into it in in the third year                                 where we talk about drupal of course we                                 give them the chance to try out                                 docker the lamp stack git and                                 as they get in contact with                                 software and they get in contact with                                 software that others have built in this                                 way                                 well it's still not easy but they                                 start to see and start to understand                                 why it is important and what the                                 benefits are                                 but then to say that they                                 actually become false enthusiasts well                                 no                                 no not at all perhaps one in                                    become an enthusiast and                                 enters the free and open source                                 community                                 but otherwise i would say um                                 the main student body they listen                                 and puts it away somewhere in their mind                                 and                                 and then it's not very important anymore                                 the big problem for us as teachers i                                 think                                 is to make it not seem hard                                 to set up docker and                                 a lamp stack and drupal virtual                                 container                                 and start collaborating with code on git                                 github or or similar i mean                                 for us it's easy because                                 drupal i mean sorry docker is simpler                                 than vagrant was                                 and vagrant was much better than what we                                 had before and so on                                 but for them coming to this from nowhere                                 not really understanding                                 virtualization neither                                 full virtualization or container                                 virtualization                                 they struggle and                                 it's hard for me to make sure that their                                 struggle                                 doesn't leave them with a bad taste in                                 their mouths                                 regarding drupal or foss                                 when the problem is perhaps that                                 they should have                                 [Music]                                 the problem lies in the infrastructure i                                 think                                 and perhaps we are trying to teach them                                 too much                                 perhaps we are too enthusiastic perhaps                                 we shouldn't give them                                 the docker treatment but already                                 made container in kubernetes or                                 equivalent and just let them build                                 there but it is still a part of                                 what we are supposed to teach them they                                 are supposed to learn about these stuff                                 these things and if they go out to a                                 company                                 search for a job which they can't do                                 after                                 the three years with us they will find                                 companies that                                 work with these technologies all the                                 time i have                                 acquaintances in the force community and                                 in the web development community                                 and we have visited them at their                                 companies and we                                 asked about what kind of stacks they use                                 what kind of software they use                                 and we really try to use the same things                                 when we educate our students                                 so the biggest                                 problems that the biggest                                 thresholds we have to pass to                                 get the growing generation to understand                                 and accept foss is                                 obscurity as a as it ever has been as it                                 has been for since forever                                 they simply don't know it exists or why                                 they should care                                 and the other is that it sort of                                 is moving out of reach into the cloud                                 and that way they never get in contact                                 with it                                 or that teachers and municipalities                                 in sweden at least and i guess it's the                                 same in                                 most of europe simply doesn't have the                                 knowledge                                 needed to leave the safe bosom of                                 microsoft and adobe                                 and introduce the alternatives                                 and also that                                 not all the software is as polished                                 as it perhaps could be to make the                                 transition                                 as easy as possible for the                                 students that is                                 what i've noticed and what i've                                 identified                                 shall we take some questions perhaps                                 thank you very much                                 thank you kenneth uh that was a very                                 interesting talk i have two kids myself                                 so i'm always curious about how in                                 german public school                                 so i'm always curious about how this is                                 done in other places we certainly                                 have our fair share of similar problems                                 it sounds like                                 uh especially when it comes to dealing                                 with uh                                 teachers with laptops and you know                                 matching software with with students and                                 funding and networking and high-speed                                 internet                                 and yes seems like seems like it's a                                 common problem                                 um there are there are no questions that                                 are coming up uh just yet but i actually                                 have a question                                 um for you based on the years that                                 you've been doing this have you                                 seen kids come back later                                 and say like hey i i really this was                                 really useful for me and in what context                                 was it useful for them um or did they                                 find that like it took them a lot longer                                 to understand the fundamentals so that                                 they could get a grasp of                                 why foss is important yes yes absolutely                                 i have met students that perhaps                                 five years later realize that                                 wait a minute what kenneth taught me                                 actually                                 is something i i find useful now and it                                 actually is what people use and how                                 this how it works in in the real life                                 so to speak that they didn't really make                                 the connection                                 when i was teaching them but later when                                 they                                 went out and got the job and so forth                                 they found that                                 this is really how it works and this has                                 really helped me                                 and we also                                 we have students who stay for a fourth                                 year                                 and they go out to a company and works                                 there                                 as a part of the curriculum and they                                 always come back                                 and tell us how much more                                 they know than even the people of the                                 company                                 because we are in the forefront of                                 what we teach and what which                                 corresponds with what companies actually                                 need                                 that's that sounds great that's really                                 uh i mean it's impressive to see                                 uh to see all that coming back to you um                                 so there are a couple of questions that                                 have come                                 up as well um so one of them is from                                 your personal experience                                 um was it that catches the interest of                                 young people                                 for foss                                 so you mentioned one in                                        enthusiastic                                 yeah i guess another way maybe it's like                                 of the other students or of that for                                 that enthusiast                                 like what is it in particular about foss                                 that sort of like really clicks for them                                 i mean it's never it's not a gpl                                 i i mean what they actually go for is                                 they discover vector graphics and                                 inkscape                                 and realize how empowering that is                                 when they start to draw and create                                 or blender or one of these                                 softwares that are a really good example                                 of                                 foss it's the software that draws them                                 in                                 and it doesn't have to be much                                 i mean some only discovers linux                                 and i find that this does suit me much                                 better                                 and as soon as they appreciate the                                 software                                 whatever it is the appreciation of foss                                 comes with it                                 and then they start to in a small way                                 evangelize                                 and discover or other pieces of software                                 that helps them                                 move forward yeah okay um                                 so one other question is um what do you                                 feel open source projects could                                 do to make their projects more                                 interesting and accessible                                 to younger contributors and if there's                                 anything                                 in particular to be aware of regarding                                 safeguarding                                 i guess for young minds let's say                                 i love the things that                                 canonical has done i don't know if they                                 do it anymore but                                 when they pick bite-sized bugs                                 to fix even if it's the documentation                                 that i mean it of course every project                                 should focus on their software but also                                 to                                 have a look at the                                 instructions for that software to make                                 it simple and easy                                 to understand regardless of age because                                 that's not that difficult                                 to make sure that                                 the video snippets that explain                                 one or other functionality is easy to                                 understand for everyone                                 and also to include                                 students and people who are trying to                                 learn programming or trying to                                 get into the community to give them                                 these small                                 ways to help and to contribute                                 i think that is very important okay so                                 also contributions in terms of                                 bug reports and improvements                                 documentation                                 stuff like that absolutely and in terms                                 of safeguarding                                 and in terms of of safeguarding i mean                                 keeping things                                 in mind that these are you know                                          year olds                                 you know should projects consider like a                                 special section                                 of documentation for a younger audience                                 is there anything                                 else in mind that you would like open                                 source projects to be doing                                 in that sense i feel that that would put                                 too great a strain on the project okay                                 i think and i i these are                                 students that are surprisingly mature in                                 the way that they handle technology they                                 aren't                                 strangers to reading manuals and such i                                 mean                                 they have grown up with it in a way that                                 we haven't                                 so i think that to make them a special                                 place                                 no it's not necessary but uh                                 of course it's better to put that                                 work in that time into making sure that                                 the ordinary                                 documentation and the ordinary um                                 visible places of the project is                                 as polished as can be yeah                                 makes sense okay uh                                 so someone was asking thinking more                                 about uh regarding that question                                 about uh the last one was thinking more                                 about                                 child safety so working one-on-one with                                 adults from around the world fully                                 digitally so let's say they're they're                                 collaborating with someone and                                 you know someone asked to do a video                                 chat or something like this so keep in                                 in mind that there are youth uh any                                 ideas                                 as this as this ever happened um any any                                 ideas for maybe                                 ways to safeguard kids                                 we have been blessed in not having that                                 problem                                 and a part of that is that since they                                 only start learning programming year two                                 they are not there until year three                                 and that's when they turn                                          so and then the rules are                                 a bit different and it's so well                                 it's more or less their own                                 responsibility right of course we                                 always try to warn them about the                                 problems that can exist                                 yeah do you find that at that age when                                 kids are coming in                                 uh they already have some experience                                 understanding                                 by the from their other teachers or from                                 their parents how                                 you know how to be safe on the internet                                 is this sort of a common                                 well-known uh common knowledge or                                 is it still i'm curious as well for                                 myself what do i have to do to prepare                                 my kids                                                                                                                                                                       class                                 where                                             girl were she had her own blog                                 and she was frequently posting pictures                                 of herself in a bikini and                                 scantily clad and i took up i took this                                 as an example in class                                 to make them see that you don't know who                                 who's watching this and                                 i don't feel that any one of my students                                 would do that                                 today so something has changed these                                 this last decade and i think that                                 the educational system has caught up now                                 and i at least hope that is                                 because they have been probably warned                                 you
