Title: #FOSSBack Malvika Sharan - Building a culture of collaboration in OS communities with The Turing Way
Publication date: 2021-03-01
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	The Turing Way (https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome) is an Open Source project that involves and supports a diverse research community in ensuring that reproducible, collaborative, ethical and inclusive data research is "too easy not to do". Using this project as a model, I will discuss the importance of collaborative development, documentation and sharing open practices that can be adopted by various stakeholders in Open Source to make their work more reproducible and effective.

Built upon a culture of collaboration, The Turing Way is designed to be welcoming, inclusive and accessible to its members from diverse backgrounds and expertise. It is an open source project, that facilitates all contributions, questions, comments, and discussions via an online repository: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way. Since last year, more than 200 researchers have contributed to this project. They have co-authored chapters and developed resources that have been used by the scientific communities worldwide in learning and promoting reproducible methods in different computational research communities.

The project has grown from a small team of 10 researchers to a community of collaborators from around the world. The scope of The Turing Way book has also expanded to include the different aspects of reproducibility, project design, collaboration, communication, and ethics in data research. We continue to support our members in learning new skills and facilitate their interaction with the project via online co-working spaces and mentored-contributions.

We believe that Open Source projects like The Turing Way, that promote a culture of collaboration, can have a significant impact on improving access to information and the equitable decision-making process by our peers and future generations. We further invite FOSS participants to make use of The Turing Way and participate in its community by contributing and enhancing its resources with their perspectives.

	                              hi everyone                               my name is malvika sharon and i will be                               talking about building a culture of                               collaboration                               in open source communities i will give                               examples from my work                               as a community manager of the turingbay                               the turingway                               is an open source project that involves                                and supports                                its diverse community in making data                                science reproducible                                ethical collaborative and inclusive for                                everyone                                we believe that to make our project                                truly beneficial and comprehensible                                we need to collaborate with people with                                diverse skills backgrounds                                and domain knowledge this project is a                                part of the alan turing institute                                which is the national institute for data                                science and artificial intelligence                                in the uk the turing way is developed                                under the research program called tools                                practices and systems                                and the goal of this program includes                                providing trustworthy system                                transparent reporting inclusive                                interoperable design                                ethical integrity respectful co-creation                                and leadership in open research the                                cheering way sits across most of these                                goals                                and provides a central resource for good                                practices                                to all our researchers within the uk and                                internationally                                it was started by christopher taker as a                                book on reproducibility                                shared as a lightly opinionated guide                                this book provides                                reproducible tools and practices to help                                ensure that the phd students                                postdocs pi funding teams                                and all other stakeholders know what is                                their responsibility                                of reproducibility where they can make                                impact and how they can make their work                                more efficient                                and understandable                                reproducibility is when the same                                analysis                                is applied to the same data set it                                should give same result                                it is quite simple to define but                                involves making making complex decisions                                at every step of the way so it starts                                right                                at the research idea you want to                                communicate with others                                the plan and the design that you have in                                mind                                then you describe your protocol collect                                data sets you start processing and                                wrangling your data                                conduct your studies and analysis                                publish your work                                and other research components so                                everyone can access it                                then comes archiving data to ensure that                                your data is reusable                                meaning that someone else can go through                                this whole process of reproducing                                and building upon your work that's quite                                an overwhelming process                                moreover it does not just involve data                                practices                                but also includes the way we communicate                                our work with other                                how we design our project how                                efficiently we collaborate with each                                other                                all these while ensuring that we                                maintain highest ethical standards                                and research integrity in our research                                so in order to accommodate all these                                requirement in research in data science                                the project expanded to include four                                more four more guides in addition to the                                guide on reproducible research                                we have guide on project design                                communication collaboration and ethical                                research                                and we also record all the community                                practices that we are building and                                practicing within the touring                                way in our community handbook                                we have seen our project and community                                grow in the last two years                                 we currently host over                                                 across five guides                                 in order to ensure that our community                                 members are able to participate                                 irrespective of their previous                                 experiences of working with open source                                 community                                 we provide the resources guidance                                 templates                                 trainings and pathways that they can use                                 to stay involved in the community                                 we have over                                                            github and over                                                          of users for example                                 we have a set of illustration that i                                 have intensively used in my talk today                                 have been downloaded over                                                have                                                                   over                                                                                                                                  day-to-day conversation                                 so for a community that started at a                                 grass root level                                 we are very grateful that these members                                 work with us                                 so just to summarize the touring book or                                 project                                 it's a book but it's a community where                                 people come together to collaborate and                                 write chapters                                 build and maintain resources share their                                 skills and ideas around best practices                                 in data science and research                                 we apply open source principle in the                                 development maintenance of the book                                 finally it's built on the culture of                                 collaboration which is the process                                 and the backbone of our project so that                                 was about the touring way                                 next i will be sharing practices                                 examples and insights from this project                                 to further discuss how we can promote a                                 culture of collaboration in open source                                 communities                                 let's look at three areas of challenges                                 that i will explore in my talk                                 open source communities community                                 members                                 and building collaboration among the                                 members                                 let's start by defining what open source                                 community means                                 an open source community refers to                                 collaborative efforts in an open source                                 software                                 or resource development that anyone can                                 join                                 they can collaborate to determine                                 direction and goals                                 and the result will be made available                                 under a free license                                 in my opinion there are a lot of                                 assumption there that anyone can join                                 that things will happen collaboratively                                 and that all the outputs will be made                                 available                                 these are expectations that we cannot                                 ensure that they will happen                                 before we come back to discussing this                                 issue in detail                                 let's see who the members are these                                 people share common goals                                 and values in the project such as intent                                 to develop the software or resource                                 but they come from diverse backgrounds                                 and come with different expectation                                 a project can have an overarching vision                                 but each member who joined the project                                 have personal purpose these visions and                                 purpose leads them to support the open                                 source movement                                 as a result they collaborate in the open                                 source community                                 and they also experience different                                 challenges                                 based on their personal needs skills and                                 backgrounds                                 they will also face lots of barriers in                                 participation                                 so we saw two sets of challenge so we                                 know that there are assumption in open                                 source community                                 definition and there are barriers that                                 each member face                                 the third component of my talk is                                 building collaboration                                 which is the valuable for working                                 towards open source communities and                                 project and also to meet our personal                                 goals                                 i will explain this part in levels of                                 importance                                 the central of all the work that we do                                 is the product                                 that could be a software or a resource                                 then maintaining highest level of                                 scientific integrity                                 such as reproducibility accessibility                                 ethical standards                                 that make our work more reliable and                                 useful for our users                                 now the third level is the collaborative                                 work which is                                 very much required for the development                                 and sustainability of a community                                 where most time and resources are                                 invested this level includes development                                 testing documenting sharing archiving                                 and promoting the project                                 fourth level of collaboration is by                                 members who might not have been                                 originally involved in designing the                                 project                                 but they want to participate they                                 require support                                 in getting on-boarded in the project                                 they would like to know what tasks they                                 can do                                 what kind of training could help them                                 fill any gap they may have                                 and in the best case scenario they can                                 receive mentoring to actually become                                 part of this process                                 and take on meaningful roles                                 this will require existing members to                                 welcome them review their work                                 and provide good feedback often this is                                 the level                                 where work starts to increase for people                                 in open source                                 often these people are working as                                 volunteers                                 they are working beyond their day job                                 but also this is the part which is                                 very crucial it's crucial to ensure that                                 we are proactively promoting inclusive                                 approaches                                 to welcome diverse ideas from different                                 skill sets                                 we do not want to exclude people                                 unintentionally by not providing the                                 support that they need to become part of                                 this community                                 finally comes the level which is often                                 hidden                                 which is the reason why it's written in                                 small font but also there are just too                                 many of those hidden works                                 these are tasks that goes into                                 developing inclusive culture                                 maintaining communication having                                 interaction that are positive for people                                 providing guidelines making sure that                                 there is diversity                                 in terms of representation and ideas                                 ensure that we have pathways for                                 onboarding                                 and also off-boarding find funding                                 maintain transparency                                 have a governance publish reports and                                 incentivize people                                 help it build opportunities for                                 connection and make sure that people are                                 not burnt out                                 while we embed accessibility in all the                                 pathway                                 and also please insert anything that                                 often                                 stay hidden in open source and deserves                                 more recognition                                 this is also where most work around                                 community building happens                                 and that's where i want to focus the                                 rest of my talk                                 exploring the challenges that we have                                 just discussed in order to make                                 collaboration successful                                 and effective among open source                                 community members we need to first                                 understand                                 and accept that open by default is                                 not inclusive or accessible                                 or led by definition we saw that open                                 source community only means that people                                 are collaborating to build something to                                 make them                                 available online and honestly that is                                 not enough                                 we need to bring people in if we want                                 these aspects to become part of the                                 process                                 we need to intentionally design our                                 project to make people a part of the                                 development process                                 the human center design approach to make                                 sure that we move from                                 open to inclusive practices in community                                 which is accessible                                 for everyone and where everyone                                 contributes in a way that we count them                                 community building is a process of                                 granting access to skill and support                                 and individual or group needs to                                 participate in a community                                 and influence decision making process                                 the key to intentional community                                 building is to have more people                                 involved in the decision making process                                 this means                                 that diverse contributors are given                                 opportunities to come into the project                                 with different perspective participate                                 in the development process                                 and integrate their combined values in                                 the product                                 by design only such a product will truly                                 truly be                                 relatable useful and beneficial for                                 diverse users                                 the end goal of building a community                                 through collaboration                                 is to distribute power equally                                 throughout the community                                 so the decision making is not conducted                                 by one person with most power                                 that can be detrimental to most people                                 in the community                                 who may not get their voices heard                                 as a community builder i spend most of                                 my career thinking about                                 the development of practices around                                 building inclusive communities                                 and there are five points that i want to                                 share with you today                                 lesson one design for inclusion because                                 inclusion shouldn't be an afterthought                                 we can use open leadership principles                                 for that open                                 leadership principle for the design and                                 mozilla foundation                                 and they are set of practices and skills                                 people can use in projects                                 that allows them to collaborate within                                 and inclusive communities                                 there are three simple rules of open                                 leadership                                 first understanding so that your work is                                 clear                                 authentic and widely accessible                                 sharing so that your work can be adapted                                 reproduced and built upon by others                                 and third is participation and inclusion                                 so that we create a sense of shared                                 ownership                                 that inspires contributions                                 in the turing way every little                                 contribution counts                                 we foster a culture of collaboration by                                 ensuring                                 that the collaboration is not defined                                 just by the common goals                                 the product of the team or                                 what kind of knowledge they are                                 exchanging on the top level                                 but we also take time to make sure that                                 people are given the inclusive workspace                                 that they need to perform their                                 best that they treat each other kindly                                 abide by code of conduct                                 know what roles they can have and                                 contribute to building diverse teams                                 by explicitly opening ideas for                                 contribution                                 in all our work we apply open leadership                                 principles                                 we also define pathways for contribution                                 that always require multiple people to                                 support each other                                 for example people are invited to                                 develop and share resources within the                                 cheering way                                 we support people by mentored                                 contribution where an experienced                                 contributor                                 reviews the contributions made by new                                 contributors                                 we also create opportunities for people                                 to maintain and improve resources                                 so high level maintenance and                                 improvements are very important but                                 equally important are to invite new                                 members to help                                 in smaller tasks this could be fixing a                                 broken link                                 or fixing a bug or updating an outdated                                 resource                                 these are listed as issue for first-time                                 contributors with                                 good first issue labels that can be                                 identified by relatively new                                 contributors they can help fix these so                                 fixing                                 bugs or broken links may not be the real                                 purpose of our contributors                                 but these allow them to build confidence                                 in contributing to a new project                                 people who share our resources more                                 widely are also our contributors                                 as they communicate our work often                                 writing blogs giving contra                                 conference talk on behalf of the                                 community                                 then there are people who are more                                 interested in reviewing and updating                                 existing resources which is extremely                                 valuable                                 especially in data science and research                                 where methods and practices are rapidly                                 evolving                                 and then we have also a group of                                 contributors who are translating the                                 book into languages to make it truly                                 global so more people can read and                                 understand them                                 we have currently three languages where                                 most of the contributions are happening                                 these are spanish chinese and french                                 finally we are building a resource                                 where people are encouraged to share                                 best practices it doesn't mean that they                                 need to write everything that already                                 exists on the internet but they can come                                 and highlight their own resources in the                                 book                                 so that others can use them                                 the second lesson is to develop                                 guidelines because no one can read your                                 mind yet                                 social norms drive behavior and affect                                 community                                 culture to avoid any detrimental impact                                 of                                 unwritten rule we need to transparently                                 communicate them with the community                                 i think one of the biggest barriers a                                 new person can experience when entering                                 a project                                 is to is not knowing what the rules and                                 expectations                                 are where they can participate and how                                 they can contribute                                 all this can be very discouraging for                                 someone who is new to the project                                 and that's why documenting them is very                                 very important                                 so define those unlabeled doors tell                                 where people can go                                 label issues and pull requests describe                                 how people can participate                                 what tools will be required what kind of                                 support do they have and what kind of                                 roles and rewards are in place                                 the minimum requirement for repository                                 that even github prompts you to do when                                 you go to the insights and the community                                 project is to add a readme page                                 define how people can contribute and                                 what is the code of conduct                                 make it as detailed as possible in the                                 touring way we also have a list of                                 contributors                                 and these are people who have                                 contributed and would like to have their                                 contributors documented in detail                                 we have also carefully developed a                                 community handbook                                 this has chapter that describes how to                                 enter the project                                 we also have guidelines for supporting                                 the development of chapters                                 maintaining consistency provide we                                 provide chapter templates and workflows                                 so nobody has to start from the scratch                                 we describe other community practices                                 like how they can meet with each other                                 how they can receive reports how they                                 can                                 get involved in asynchronous uh                                 collaboration                                 and we also have of course github issues                                 and bugs that are tagged for                                 new users                                 the third lesson is foster a sense of                                 ownership                                 because communities are not built on one                                 person's opinion                                 we avoid individual authorship in the                                 favor of establishing shared ownership                                 and agency in the project                                 the project belongs to the community and                                 is always a work in progress                                 all our contributions are facilitated                                 through github most our conversation                                 happens there online                                 transparently via issues and pull                                 requests all these places for                                 us are places to invite people to join                                 in and share the discussion                                 ideas we use all contributors but it's a                                 very simple to install easy bot                                 but which allows you to recognize                                 contributed contributions                                 by contributors who don't really push                                 code on                                 github they might be people who join a                                 discussion                                 for example this one where martina and                                 batu were installing                                 a hypothesis web annotation for the book                                 but they had had a previous discussion                                 with two people                                 laura and samuel and on the way they                                 received this support from                                 you so even though these two are the                                 persons who are doing pushes there are                                 three other people who were involved in                                 the process                                 who were given the credit for this work                                 this is also for me and evidence of                                 inclusive practices and kind of culture                                 we want to develop in the project                                 since the during way is an online                                 project we want to ensure that people                                 have opportunities to meet with each                                 other and build connection we host                                 co-working calls every week                                 and collaboration cafes bi-weekly we                                 also hosted book dash which is a                                 sprint-like event so                                 co-working collaboration cafes are                                 online quiet co-working time where                                 people meet online and work together                                 but book dashes are a longer version of                                 that where people synchronously from all                                 around the world contribute to similar                                 topics                                 at the same time so the last one we had                                 was virtual                                 and honestly that was the most diverse                                 and inclusive team that we had because                                 of course people could not have attended                                 a lot of in-person events                                 so we had ideas and conversation that                                 wouldn't have otherwise happened                                 martina is one of our core contributors                                 who has been part of the community for a                                 long time                                 and attends co-working calls and she                                 says that it is quite useful for people                                 who                                 may be intimidated to work in a new                                 community with new people                                 and these conversations are quite                                 crucial for staying motivated                                 we also want to create opportunities for                                 people to learn from                                 what has happened in the past and this                                 has been also recorded quite                                 thoroughly we provide detailed guidance                                 to ensure that the best practices are                                 maintained throughout the book                                 consistently but we share them with the                                 caveat that these are recommendation                                 and we welcome new approaches of working                                 paul was the one who was involved in                                 that building                                 of consistency project he was our                                 google season of doc intern and it was                                 the first time he was contributing to                                 open source                                 and he found the experience of working                                 in open source quite rewarding because                                 he realized that the work is not in the                                 amount of work he does                                 but how he enable other people                                 the fourth reason uh fourth lesson is                                 recognize all contributions                                 because we want to incentivize                                 collaboration and promote diversity                                 we do not recognize if we do not                                 recognize all contribution we will end                                 up disproportionately ignoring the                                 hidden labor                                 that a lot of people do and especially                                 those who are quite new to the tech                                 community                                 often those people are members of                                 marginalized group who have historically                                 been excluded from open source and tech                                 spaces                                 in the turing way we recognize all                                 contribution first of all                                 as mentioned we use all contributors                                 part that records                                 all the contribution directly on pull                                 requests and githubs                                 but we also provide dedicated page in                                 the book for the contributors to write                                 what they think is meaningful for them                                 to highlight their work                                 they share how they can how                                 one person can meet them how they can                                 collaborate with them                                 and what they have worked on so for                                 example we have uh batools                                 page so everyone gets their dedicated                                 link                                 so this can be used for example someone                                 wants to build a new skill such as                                 working with version control                                 or building community they can choose to                                 work on specific tasks that matches                                 their interest                                 they can then update their page                                 describing how they achieve the skill                                 which is an evidence for them that can                                 become part of their cv                                 in order to create opportunities for                                 people to come into the project and                                 highlight their work we want to meet                                 them                                 where they are so                                 if you're new to the community join the                                 community you can learn a new skill you                                 can share a new skill                                 you can collaborate with other mentor                                 other and represent this community                                 and we will value your participation in                                 any form                                 our moonshot goal is to make                                 reproducibility too easy not to do                                 and that can happen when we can make                                 system and structure level changes                                 influencing research and policy at                                 national and international level                                 some of the notable impact we had in                                                                                              contributors                                 was that the project was highlighted in                                 eu report for reproducibility                                 a policy by mayor of london on emerging                                 technology charter was used                                 by was created using the turing way                                 as an open inclusive project a funding                                 call from ukra reference the project                                 as an example of data science culture uh                                 community trainings like code refinery                                 and data                                 and library carpentries have referenced                                 the during way and the work has been                                 cited in multiple                                 papers so let's recap there are four                                 lessons that i have shared                                 shared so far for culture of                                 collaboration design for inclusion                                 because inclusion cannot be an                                 afterthought                                 develop guidelines because we can't read                                 your mind yet                                 foster a sense of ownership because                                 strong communities are not built on one                                 person's opinion                                 recognize all contributions because we                                 want to incentivize collaboration and                                 promote                                 diversity there's a lot more to                                 community building that i'm not                                 discussing today but there is one more                                 thing that i want to mention                                 invest in community building                                 if you have funding to hire a community                                 manager or more community managers                                 please do                                 if you don't find other ways to reward                                 and support volunteers who are doing                                 these jobs                                 community building is a full-time job                                 and it is important to facilitate a                                 culture of collaboration                                 volunteers are often overworked and                                 possibly burnt out                                 we cannot put these hidden and often                                 emotional labor on them                                 therefore it makes a huge difference to                                 have someone working full-time in                                 identifying what people's need are how                                 we can make it easy for them to                                 participate                                 it is probably a very selfish pitch                                 because i enjoy my work as a community                                 building                                 and i find it quite valuable in create                                 clearing                                 hurdle to enable people to do what they                                 do best                                 with the skills that they have so to                                 summarize my talk                                 building a culture of collaboration in a                                 community open source or otherwise                                 requires a lot of care and nurturing it                                 cannot just happen                                 we need to be purposeful in integrating                                 values we want to build                                 with that i'd like to thank all the                                 contributors and members of the

to take any question thank you                                 yeah i just want to say thank you so                                 much for that presentation it was really                                 good                                 um i thought there were some really                                 interesting points in there i                                 i maybe it's uh an obvious one but i                                 just like the                                 idea of um intentional designing um that                                 you know these uh open source projects                                 aren't inclusive by default                                 and that you know we have to think about                                 them from the very beginning and all the                                 way through                                 i think that's um a very important point                                 um if anyone has any questions                                 um please drop them into the chat um                                 and i will ask them for you um                                 while people are typing i just wanted to                                 say that that my talk is online i'll                                 drop a link to the pdf                                 and i'm sorry i couldn't provide the                                 transcription but i have a transcription                                 that i will also just share                                 in online as a synodo link what advice                                 would you give to organizations or                                 groups                                 if they can't afford to                                 hire someone as a full-time community                                 developer or manager                                 how would you um advise them to go                                 forward                                 i think yeah no it's a it's a great                                 great question and it's a huge problem                                 in most of the communities                                 one of the projects that you had                                 mentioned that i'm also part of                                 which is open life science where we                                 train people how to lead their                                 communities and                                 the problem with that training it's                                 great but we also have to tell                                 our people that volunteer tasks                                 shouldn't be always free                                 that we need to actually find money to                                 support these people but if we can't                                 find money i think we can invest in                                 their skill building                                 we need to identify tasks                                 which are not really big can we break                                 down community building into smaller                                 tasks can we involve                                                                                                         not sleeping well                                 doing all these steps so i think just                                 bringing those you know human aspect is                                 very important                                 that someone is taking responsibility um                                 if the if the projects are running for                                 free                                 i i am quite sad that's the case because                                 that's truly the case worldwide but                                 there are funding                                 uh options that are often available and                                 communicating with the communities for                                 example                                 um sloane moore foundation or bill and                                 melinda kate foundation welcome trust                                 these are some places where funding can                                 be available                                 but also apar there's one community it's                                 called                                 open bioinformatics foundation we're at                                 the moment trying to launch                                 a grassroot level community support                                 funding which is not a lot of money                                 it gives about one thousand dollars it's                                 not                                 a lot but it at least help people with                                 infrastructure costs like you know                                 having a zoom account or                                 setting a communication platform                                 so yeah funding is not the answer but i                                 do think involving more people in these                                 emotional labor                                 is is the answer yeah i guess that um                                 fits with um what you were talking about                                 this uh hidden labor as well                                 like uh maybe if if the                                 hidden labor is made more visible then                                 people can                                 keep an eye on how it's being done and                                 who's doing it and making sure it                                 doesn't all fall to the same person                                 absolutely yeah another shout out to                                 this new project called hidden ref                                 hidden ref is a alternative of ref which                                 is probably very uk-centric where people                                 recognize a research                                 contribution he didn't reference                                 everything behind the research                                 contribution                                 the the recent addition that they had is                                 called lived experience in research                                 where people use people's lived                                 experience to build communities                                 or project but they don't get                                 recognition for all the investment that                                 they do so i think that's                                 something to look out for                                 you
