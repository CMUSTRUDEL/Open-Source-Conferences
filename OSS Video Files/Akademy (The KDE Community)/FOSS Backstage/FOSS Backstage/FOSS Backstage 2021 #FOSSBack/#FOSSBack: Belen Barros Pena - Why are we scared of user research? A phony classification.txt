Title: #FOSSBack: Belen Barros Pena - Why are we scared of user research? A phony classification
Publication date: 2021-03-01
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Most of the free software projects I know do little to none research with their users. Well ... the vast majority do absolutely none, and very few do a teensy little bit, most of the time with the most vocal members of their user base. Why is that? Why is free software scared of user research?


This presentation will propose a classification of free software types based on their ideas and attitudes towards user research. The classification is really just a joke, but I hope it will help me debunk some of the misunderstandings and myths that surround user research in free software circles. I will also try to explain what user research is actually about, how it can help your free software project, and give you some advice on how to get started with it.

	                              thank you paul                               um and thank you everybody for joining                               me in this session                               where i'm gonna try and talk about um                               why                               we are not doing user research in free                               software                               the truth is that the vast majority of                               the free software projects i know of                                don't do any research with users at all                                and those that they they tend to do                                surveys which is kind of the lowest                                common denominator                                in the world of user research and to be                                honest they on their own                                they are not even that useful for these                                online purposes                                so why is this why aren't we doing                                user research in free software why are                                we scared                                of it um if i guess if i'm going to talk                                about design                                and research and the relationship                                between the two i probably should                                start by explaining what i mean by                                design                                and what i mean by research so                                for the purposes of this stock design                                is interaction design and interaction                                design                                is the branch of design that deals with                                the structure                                and the behavior of software interfaces                                and interaction design is what you what                                you're doing with you are making                                decisions about                                what your software should do and how it                                should do it                                and understood in this fashion                                interaction design applies                                to all kinds of software and all kinds                                of interfaces                                not just the graphical ones                                and for the purpose of this talk                                research                                is any activity that involves                                your users in the process of making                                the software so basically user research                                is about                                getting users to help you or to work                                with you                                in the interaction design work                                can interaction design exist without                                research                                can it truly be done without the                                research parts                                in the university where i study i am                                surrounded by people who believe                                that you cannot do interaction design                                and you shouldn't be designing anything                                really                                without doing research but                                when i spend time with people in the                                free software world                                very often or often i come across people                                who are                                somehow weary                                nervous and sometimes downright                                hostile to this idea of doing research                                with users as part of the process                                of making and developing software                                those people have come to call somehow                                drunkenly                                the naysayers and um on the basis of                                their arguments                                against his research i've come to                                classify them                                into four groups they do scratchers                                this scornful the dismissive                                and the defeatist so if you allow me i'm                                going to go through each every turn                                so let's start with the each scratchers                                the age of scratchers are people who                                believe                                who are developing software who are                                making software                                and but to solve a problem that they                                believe is                                solely their own since this is                                my problem they said that the only                                people i need to do research with                                is myself other people are welcome                                to use my software if they want to do so                                but in the understanding                                that my software is about my problem                                and it might not be ideal for them                                although there is a certain logic to                                this argument                                i think it is also somehow detached from                                 reality                                 you see um when you make a piece of                                 software                                 your age it's your age                                 as long as you are the only person using                                 that software the moment a user comes                                 along                                 someone else comes along and starts                                 using your software the age all of a                                 sudden                                 becomes                                                 someone else's when a second user                                 comes along then the age becomes about                                                                    yours when a third user appears                                 your itch becomes                                          do you see where i'm going with this                                 the percentage of your age reduces                                 exponentially                                 as you add answers to your software                                 so by the time                                                        your age what used to be your inch                                 is now only to present yours                                 of course you may used to tell you may                                 choose to tell yourself that your age is                                 still your age but that doesn't that                                 doesn't change the fact                                 that it is not anymore the                                 only way for your each to remain                                 your age is keeping the source code to                                 yourself                                 the moment you release your code then                                 for the world to use                                 you need to clone to terms with the fact                                 that your each                                 is unlikely to remain yours for loan                                 the truth is that the moment you release                                 your code                                 you release your each with it                                 the second type of naysayers are the                                 squirmful                                 and the squirmful are the kind of people                                 who will quote you henry ford                                 they argue that people that users of                                 software                                 are incapable of telling you what they                                 need or what they want                                 and that use it that designers are                                 somehow better positioned                                 to determine those things than people                                 themselves                                 as its designers or some kind of                                 you know superior or more evolved kind                                 of human being                                 one that has managed to overcome their                                 limitation the human limitation that                                 stops us from being able to articulate                                 our own needs and wants                                 i'm sure i don't need to convince you                                 that people who believe designers are in                                 any way superior to other human beings                                 are killing themselves designers are                                 are in as incapable of articulating                                 their own wants and                                 needs and determining what it is that                                 they want or what they need as anyone                                 else                                 the only superpower designers have is                                 the recognition                                 that this is so that this is a                                 quintessential                                 human limitation and that overcoming                                 that limitation requires time                                 and effort and that certain tricks of                                 the design trait                                 for instance doing research with users                                 can help us                                 overcome that limitation                                 [Music]                                 the third type of naysayer is the                                 dismissive                                 the dismissive um that this mystic will                                 tell you that every time you ask                                 someone anything related to the sign                                 every single person                                 will tell you a different thing                                 and then the designer will be left to                                 try and sort out the mess                                 the designer will need to try and                                 reconcile                                 different opinions about things that may                                 not only just be different                                 sometimes they need they may be also                                 contradictory                                 so they they could very well be                                 reconcilable                                 and these will lead to the sign                                 paralysis where god                                 saves us all the dreaded desire by                                 committing                                 these people seem to be under this brush                                 under the impression that                                 doing research with users is about                                 asking the users their opinion                                 about things what they think about stuff                                 but actually doing research with users                                 is                                 not like that at all                                 the object of the study in user research                                 is not                                 user's opinions it's actually                                 human behavior                                 and in the process of trying to make                                 sense of understanding human behavior                                 sometimes when we do research we'll have                                 conversations with people and we'll ask                                 them questions                                 but those questions will never be                                 directly about the software we are                                 building                                 or the thing we are designing they will                                 be about the problem                                 we are trying to solve with the software                                 about the context and the circumstances                                 in which                                 that problem exists and about the ways                                 people try to solve                                 that problem now before using the                                 software which are often very quirky and                                 very creative and sometimes the research                                 we do a whole chunk of the research with                                 users actually does not involve                                 any question asking at all it involves                                 just observing                                 observing how people go about their                                 business observing how                                 they solve their problems observing the                                 context                                 within which they live and do things and                                 sometimes yes                                 it also involves watching people                                 observing people as they use                                 our software what we often call                                 usability testing                                 as we go about observing people's                                 behaviors we come across the fact                                 that these are very individual you know                                 every person is slightly different                                 but across that individuality there are                                 also                                 strong patterns and commonalities and                                 sameness those are the things that are                                 normally                                 really extremely useful to designers                                 those are the things we are hunting for                                 when we are doing user research                                 and because in the end design research                                 user research has absolutely nothing to                                 do                                 and with opinions as i said of what                                 people think                                 it is about uncovering the commonalities                                 underpin individual human behavior                                 and finally the last type of naysayer                                 in free supper i called daddy fittest                                 the deputies claimed that research doing                                 research with users                                 it's just too much work it takes too                                 much time                                 too much energy too much effort too much                                 money                                 and because of that it is unsuitable                                 for free software projects                                 i imagine that for the defeatist and the                                 word research                                 must conjure images of you know fancy                                 research labs with one-way mirrors and                                 loads of cameras                                 or really long longitudinal studies                                 or years long ethnographic endeavors and                                 that result in ten thousand                                 paper ten thousand word papers and that                                 are gonna be published in a very serious                                 journal                                 and that's the stuff academics do                                 because they are trying                                 to develop theory but hang on a minute                                 we are not trying to develop theory here                                 we are just trying to make some software                                 for crying out loud so here is the truth                                 about the kind of research that is                                 suitable for our software                                 making purposes let's start with tom                                 how long does it take to do this type of                                 research                                 well if you will if you want to do an                                 interview study if you're going to go                                 and                                 talk to some of your users six users                                 is enough and if you want to do a                                 usability test study you want to observe                                 people as they use your software                                 five people five users is enough                                 your visual sessions should never be                                 longer than                                            this means that a usability study can be                                 done in three hours and                                            and an interview study can be done in                                 four and a half                                 hours i don't know about you but i don't                                 think i don't think this is that much                                 time                                 what about the money how much does it                                 cost                                 to do research is it really that                                 expensive                                 well let's see tons of research with                                 users can be done                                 remotely using things like gt meat                                 and research can be captured by                                 recording audio                                 and video and with things like obs                                 studio completely for free as before                                 with youtube                                 and you don't need to pay money to your                                 research participants necessarily                                 and you see there are lots of ways that                                 you can compensate                                 your research participants for their                                 time their effort other feedback                                 you just need to have an honest                                 conversation with with them about it                                 perhaps they want some training about                                 something to do with the software in                                 return for taking part of your research                                 or maybe there's just one they just want                                 a t-shirt or some stickers                                 or maybe they just want to thank you                                 just a thank you maybe enough                                 you see um taking part in research is a                                 form                                 of contributing to free software just                                 like submitting code or writing                                 documentation                                 a lot of us contribute to his software                                 to free support for pleasure                                 so it is very likely that some of your                                 user base at least                                 will be willing to help you just for the                                 pleasure to help                                 a free software project remember                                 research is a form of contribution to                                 this software                                 even if we are not used to think of it                                 that way                                 and we should really start considering                                 and valuing it                                 so so                                 research it turns out that research                                 doesn't need to be expensive                                 and can be known for zero euro                                 what about the effort the bulk of the                                 effort of doing research                                 is actually making sense of it what we                                 call the analysis process                                 trying to understand what it is that the                                 research is trying to tell you                                 research analysis can be done quite                                 effectively in teams                                 using the affinity diagram technique                                 which this is what the video is showing                                 you at the moment a group of people                                 trying to make sense of research                                 altogether                                 so this can be done in a few hours but                                 because your research studies are likely                                 to be                                 small with a small number of                                 participants and short sessions                                 and you can easily analyze the research                                 by yourself as well                                 in just a couple of hours here's an                                 example of that kind of analysis that i                                 did just by myself                                 in about an hour and a half and you                                 don't need to write after working out                                 what the research was trying to tell you                                 in order to communicate                                 your research to other people involved                                 in the free software project you don't                                 need to write a                                                 in fact you shouldn't write a                                          report because it's guaranteed that                                 nobody will read it                                 and you can just simply write a blog                                 post                                 or a wiki page or an email                                 to a mailing list or you can organize a                                 call or record a                                 podcast to explain what you learned                                 through the research                                 all these shortcuts will do and they                                 come with all very effectively in                                 a very short period of time                                 so really it doesn't take that much                                 effort doing research either                                 so finally some common sense advice                                 if you want to introduce research                                 activities in your free software project                                 first and if it looks like you cannot                                 answer the questions you have about your                                 software                                 and with one of these small studies                                 break                                 down your research questions into                                 simpler                                 research questions okay just make the                                 questions you're asking yourself and the                                 software and the questions you want to                                 ask your users a little bit simpler                                 and organize several smaller studies                                 instead of a really big one in the end                                 you are way more likely to learn                                 more stuff with these many studies that                                 if you organize a single study that is                                 really big                                 that's really not a very effective way                                 of working so no                                 no don't talk to                                                   single study that doesn't make sense                                 just organize six different studies five                                 different studies with six people                                 get into the habit of doing research                                 periodically for instance                                 a user interview per month and this way                                 your insights about your users your                                 knowledge of the users will build over                                 time                                 as you do more and more of those in the                                 end                                 free software projects are not in a                                 hurry you don't need to beat anyone to                                 market or any crap like that                                 so you can take your time with the                                 research too                                 and finally remember that research is                                 not a bunch of activities to do                                 research is first and foremost a                                 narcissist                                 an attitude that you bring with you to                                 every single encounter                                 with your users an attitude of genuine                                 interest                                 that results in detailed observations of                                 human                                 behavior immerse yourself in the                                 environment of your users                                 observe the ways they go about stuff                                 and watch them as they use your software                                 um                                 because um don't let you know don't let                                 the naysayers                                 stop you from doing software for doing                                 research for your free software project                                 because sure we can make just                                 software without doing any research with                                 your users but if you want to make                                 good software the kind of software that                                 makes                                 sense to the people who use it you                                 cannot do that                                 without messing about with the research                                 bits                                 thanks very much
