Title: #FOSSBack: Dirk Riehle - First Ph.D. Then Startup
Publication date: 2021-03-02
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	As a professor, I want to create open source startups with my doctoral (Ph.D.) students. To that end, I have set up courses and a whole program. Frankly, there is no better place than Germany to get started, as public funding can carry you through the research well into Series A territory. In this talk, I'll explain how I try to give my students their Ph.D. and help them turn their research work into a startup.

	                              so welcome to my talk                               my name is dougla i'm a professor of                               computer science in germany                               at a german university and my goal is to                               show you that it's                               not hard to have a startup maybe an open                               source                               uh startup if you know how to use the                               academic system                                along the way but not necessarily so you                                can                                get a phd that can but must not go ahead                                can doesn't have to go hand in hand so                                why                                well so some of you may remember this                                fabulous                                south park cartoon where there's                                something you love to do                                these are the gnomes uh something you                                love to do like perform research or                                solve challenging technical problems but                                you also want to make money meaning                                there's a profit and you want to earn a                                living                                so the challenge is how do you go from                                something you have                                passion for to well                                well having a profit i say earning your                                living                                and the idea is here that if you were to                                get a position at a german university                                the setup is such that you can fairly                                easily in my book                                use that to develop                                software that can feed into a startup                                and it's actually quite comfortable so                                so part of my story here                                is it does not have to be painful you                                don't have to be suffer you you don't                                have to suffer you don't                                have to only have two meals a day or                                something                                because um at least in germany uh you                                can get a fully salaried position at the                                university                                most computer science professors have                                plenty of positions available                                and that is fully salaried at                                           so that's not a stipend that's a real                                salary                                um you get to experience university life                                but you have a project that you get                                employed on                                where you can both own your skills                                or develop open source software if you                                choose the right professor                                well then because it's open source                                software maybe you will find users maybe                                you understand needs                                of users maybe ultimately                                you can turn this initial open source                                software over time into something                                for a startup there's a lot more here to                                say                                than my five minutes will let me do but                                you can build out a startup team there                                will be other people                                like you like-minded and                                in parallel but again you don't have to                                but you can if you want to                                follow say a design science approach                                which is a particular way of                                also performing research on top of that                                software you're developing                                where along the way you identify a                                problem you find solutions for that                                problem you find a way of                                evaluating that and write a dissertation                                which is the requirement                                for that title if you are after the                                title                                the way it works at a university is very                                much like an open source even                                if for whatever reason your professor                                doesn't let you develop open source                                software the style of collaboration is                                like it                                is like uh in open source because                                most of the time a research associate                                called listen schaffler here metabytes                                this and shaftly hibitab                                in in german will                                be an architect or a main developer of a                                system but work with master students so                                they are                                the quality assurance the code                                integrators so they                                delegate work they get work from                                students                                 they are responsible for the                                 architecture they are the committees                                 of an open source project even if it's                                 not even                                 open source they were developing                                 at the same time so being a phd student                                 that's the other aspect of being at a                                 university if you want to do                                 research can be a lot of fun so usually                                 people                                 join me or i'm able to hire people                                 because they want to get a phd                                 and that can mean academic conferences                                 and far away places worth a lot of fun                                 but at some point of time where you have                                 done all your development work and you                                 have written a few research papers and                                 written                                 a citation you will have to spin off                                 your work                                 into a software startup and here                                 that is my particularly particular                                 expertise i can help you                                 turn that into a commercial open source                                 software startup                                 um i won't go into details given my five                                 minutes but i                                 will you will have to find that team                                 help build that team or maybe you're                                 joining a team                                 go through what makes a startup which is                                 understanding your customers                                 and defining what it is they need and                                 getting the funding to turn the software                                 from the university                                 which may already be really far into a                                 real product                                 there's a lot of funding in germany so                                 even after you got your phd and leave                                 university with a startup                                 you don't have to either earn money                                 right away                                 from your product or have a venture                                 capitalist                                 uh take half your company no there's a                                 lot of                                 public funding to keep you going so you                                 get to keep                                 the intellectual so you get to keep your                                 equity it remains                                 much longer than say in the silicon                                 valley it remains your company and                                 meaning                                 your values count and it's again your                                 company                                 these are just examples of way of                                 getting money and it feeds                                 teams of three four five people for                                 a year or and a half and then you can                                 chain these so what the startup act                                 actually eventually does how it's                                 structured how aggressive it is how                                 profit oriented                                 how socially oriented that's up to you                                 but again my message here is                                 find a professor that professor has                                 the means to channel the funds to you                                 the public grants because                                 at least the country of germany really                                 wants you                                 to start those open source software to                                 start those                                 startups but then in my book open source                                 software startups because that's the                                 perfect way                                 of how you do it from university                                 here's my contact information i see                                 something about                                 slides uh coming along                                 my slides are available on my website                                 here so go to                                 thegrila.com and there's also a course                                 on commercial open source software                                 startups so
