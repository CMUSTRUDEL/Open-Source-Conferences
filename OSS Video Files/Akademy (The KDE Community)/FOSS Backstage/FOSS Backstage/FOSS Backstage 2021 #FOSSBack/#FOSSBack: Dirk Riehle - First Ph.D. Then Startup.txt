Title: #FOSSBack: Dirk Riehle - First Ph.D. Then Startup
Publication date: 2021-03-02
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	As a professor, I want to create open source startups with my doctoral (Ph.D.) students. To that end, I have set up courses and a whole program. Frankly, there is no better place than Germany to get started, as public funding can carry you through the research well into Series A territory. In this talk, I'll explain how I try to give my students their Ph.D. and help them turn their research work into a startup.
