Title: #FOSSBack: Jan Ainali - The Governance Game - a conversation starter tool
Publication date: 2021-03-02
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Governance is important, but unless you start out with a really clear vision, it might be hard to get everyone on the same page. People join projects at various times and when the project is small, governance is often not a top priority. Governance usually becomes a priority ex-post, or when a project is already in full implementation. So how do you get agreement and a common understanding on the governance of your codebase? If it wasn't already clear, chances are that people will have different views on what the status quo is. And if discussions are started based on different premises, misunderstandings are bound to happen. That is why we created the Governance Game. The Governance Game (https://github.com/publiccodenet/governance-game) is a fun way to explore how organisations can maintain shared and collaborative open content together. It can help you and your community to start talking about various aspects of governance, and highlight potential pitfalls. In this session we'll show you a few different ways of how you can use this game to enhance your project.

	                              so                               hello i'm jan einelli i am a code based                               steward at the foundation for                               public code and after me we're going to                               hear from my colleague eric                               about what we do as well but essentially                               we're helping public organizations                               collaborate                               when they are developing uh software                                and when you do collaborations uh                                you're gonna need end up with needy of                                uh governance and unless you start out                                with a very clear                                vision it might be hard to get everyone                                on the same page                                people join the code base at various                                times and when you start                                you usually don't prioritize governance                                because it's                                just you and your team so                                it usually becomes a priority after you                                really need it and when                                it is already in full implementation                                and if it wasn't already clear it is a                                very good chance that people have                                different views of what the status quo                                is                                and if destruction discussions are                                started                                uh with different premises                                misunderstandings are                                bound to happen so how do you get                                agreement                                and a common understanding of code base                                yeah so that's why we at the foundation                                for public code                                created the governance game and the                                governance game                                is a card game                                and yes if you can get that in a large                                view there so it's a game designed to                                get people talking about                                governance in in a setup and it includes                                different starting states which have a                                variety of different actors and the                                actors                                can be public organizations civil                                servants steering groups                                and such and to make it more real                                we also added a few scenario cards which                                gives you they are based on real                                situations                                to give you a little bit of a trick and                                the purpose is to get a consensus                                of how the governance in this project                                should work and it is a co-op game                                so the only way to really lose is if you                                cannot agree at all                                and to make it a little bit more tricky                                we added                                a few calamities things that might                                happen                                you find a bug or there are some other                                concerns and such                                and when we designed this we thought                                this is a                                great exercise to get used to talk about                                governance                                but it's also really good to to actually                                evaluate                                your current code base so you can                                remove the starting state you can remove                                the scenario because that's your real                                case and instead you will map                                out the                                all the actors that is in your project                                and try to figure out what are the                                responsibilities                                between these and what are the                                relationship and dependencies and even                                better if you put the paper underneath                                and draw a little bit that'll be really                                good because it's make it less                                abstract than just word on what the                                governance is                                so you can really get into hands-on and                                see                                how it actually is using or how you're                                actually using your governance                                and this might lead that you want to                                change your governance                                or it might just lead that everybody has                                a clear view of                                how it's really working now we made this                                about this time last year                                and thought hey being hands-on is good                                but then the pandemic happened                                so we have developed a little bit of an                                online version where these are sort of                                 digital tokens where you move around                                 it's not as intuitive as moving cards                                 because people have a really good mental                                 model of how to do that                                 but but it works and it unlocks another                                 potential                                 it makes it possible to collaborate with                                 all the people in your code base                                 even if they're scattered around the                                 world so perhaps you couldn't even                                 travel and get everyone to travel to the                                 same page                                 place so we hope you will try this out                                 it's on github available so and it's                                 free and open source i'm posting the                                 link right                                 now in the chat and                                 try and use it and contribute back and                                 improve on it if you like to                                 and hopefully you'll have a few laughs                                 along the way as well
