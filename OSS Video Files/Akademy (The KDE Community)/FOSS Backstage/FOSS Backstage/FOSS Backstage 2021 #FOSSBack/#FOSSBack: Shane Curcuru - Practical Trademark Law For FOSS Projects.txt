Title: #FOSSBack: Shane Curcuru - Practical Trademark Law For FOSS Projects
Publication date: 2021-02-24
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Are you trying to build the brand of your community-led project? Is your community struggling to keep vendor marketing teams out of your project's governance? Do you need a lawyer before you can "trademark" something, or can you do it yourself? (Tip: you can do it yourself!)

This AMA is here to help answer basic trademark law questions in practical, everyday terms for FOSS projects and the companies that contribute to them. Legal advice can only come from your own lawyer - but most community questions have practical answers that can get you started without a lawyer. Trademarks are all about the public's association of a brand with a product - and most of that happens in the real world, not a lawyer's office.

Bring your simple community questions about how trademarks work, and we'll try to get you some practical advice on what to do. Similarly, corporate questions are welcome - for how you can effectively partner with a Foundation or community-led project without stepping on toes.

Trademark education for engineers and community members.

	                              today                               i'll just take                                                      all of our wonderful hosts and the                               organization that's running all of this                               um foss backstage is such an amazingly                               well-run conference not only not of                               course the people are great but                               but having everything done the streaming                               situation the chats                                it's super awesome to be here uh to be                                here today with all of you                                so today now we're gonna talk about um                                putting our mouse on the right right                                slide practical trademark                                law for your project uh since most of us                                here are either leaders or participants                                in open source projects                                this is really about how we on the                                project side not as much                                on the corporate side um think about our                                our trademarks and our brands and how                                what we can do about it some practical                                advice                                so typically we we usually                                would have a talk about trademark law                                topics and what the law says                                but i'm going to turn around if you                                notice the bullet points here                                are a number of practical advice is                                actually more important                                so if you're in the corporate world or                                maybe if you're part of a linux                                foundation major project                                the trade the law is is important and                                you need to do all sorts of things about                                it                                but for most of us we don't have those                                resources and we have                                also different skills and different                                abilities so really the practical side                                is what i think is most important for us                                and there are some things that                                you probably haven't thought about                                so this is also an ask me anything so                                i'm going to have time for questions                                later                                but i really want to go through some big                                picture                                things that we as project leaders or                                participants should think about                                in terms of better managing and                                promoting our own trademarks and                                especially defending them from                                you know the little vc uh startup                                commercial companies that come along and                                try and                                seal your reputation so these are the                                practical bits                                once i get through these uh i'll start                                opening up for questions i have                                individual sections on different parts                                of trademark law in terms of how it                                actually applies                                to open source projects which is                                different than commercial projects in                                many places                                in some cases but i want to go to the                                there's way too much content for that um                                so i want to go into the places that                                people here are interested in we can go                                into specific sections                                to answer questions or take general                                questions                                so here's some practical advice                                practical trademark advice for your                                project                                the first one is use consistent                                trademarks                                so many of us know what our software                                does and we're so excited about it                                and we we call it different names we                                might use the old logo                                the first thing and the simplest thing                                to do to help protect your marks                                is use them consistently use the name of                                your                                product the thing that people download                                in a consistent way capitalize it                                using a special font whatever your your                                particular brand is                                always use it as an adjective so the                                best way to say it is                                download apache couchdb software here                                because from the trademark law                                perspective trademarks                                are marking a product with a name with a                                symbol that people recognize                                so a lot of us are pretty sloppy with                                that                                 which is fine in normal use but doing                                 these kind of things including the                                 little tm                                 and the r symbol if you have a                                 registration um those ways                                 are part of at least in in many                                 countries in first to use countries                                 showing displaying your trademarks with                                 um                                 the appropriate symbols and doing them                                 the way that the law intends which is a                                 little bit clunky sometimes but                                 okay um is a way to build up common law                                 rights                                 uh so even if you haven't registered or                                 you haven't done anything else                                 in many countries you will still have                                 rights to your marks as long as                                 someone looking at them could recognize                                 them                                 another easy thing here is essentially                                 this is treat your trademarks with                                 respect                                 so we have licenses and we have codes of                                 conduct that tell us                                 and tell participants how they can use                                 our software                                 how they can participate in our                                 communities well do you have a trademark                                 use policy                                 it's not that hard there's there's one                                 online that you can simply copy that's                                 written for open source projects but                                 treating your trademarks                                 as an important part of your project and                                 your community                                 is the first step show everybody else                                 that you treat take it seriously                                 and that helps other people see that as                                 an important asset to your project and                                 something they should respect                                 here's the this is the hardest question                                 really at the root of it for                                 open source projects is how strong is                                 your organization's reputation                                 in the larger world so most trademark                                 issues are really solved either through                                 private negotiation                                 or through public shaming there's a lot                                 of private negotiation that goes on that                                 you never see                                 unless you're in that organization we've                                 all seen a few                                 places where public shaming has been                                 used                                 and sure you know there have been a                                 handful of trademark cases in open                                 source but                                 really most of the work is done by                                 making the right                                 business case to some potential                                 infringer                                 uh who's infringing on your marks and                                 the way you do that is by showing that                                 your space                                 in the open source ecosystem in the                                 technology ecosystem                                 is important and that it's your                                 trademark and they need to stop                                 infringing on it so                                 this is the really two parts to this one                                 is                                 how well-known is your organization as                                 your reputation overall                                 just either your project or the whole                                 you know umbrella organization you're                                 with                                 how well known is it in corporate                                 circles right will                                 corporations and people leading large                                 projects who might be                                 taking your code and then reselling it                                 and using your name                                 how will they know you or not the other                                 side of the question is                                 how well do key developers in your                                 technology area                                 know your project because a huge way to                                 make sure that large companies respect                                 your trademarks                                 is if there are contributors to your                                 project get to also work at those                                 companies                                 or work at partner companies get them to                                 do internal advocacy                                 um the point is that most                                 the most ways we successfully defend                                 open source trademarks from misuse                                 are through these social and business                                 case aspects it's not not really about                                 the law                                 from our perspective and this i i admit                                 this is                                 a difficult thing for smaller projects                                 because they don't have the reputation                                 so at the apache software foundation i                                 created the position of vp                                 vice president brand management and                                 wrote our trademark policy                                 and after i worked with it for a while i                                 realized i was never concerned about                                 going to court                                 because apache and a few other                                 organizations have this the breadth to                                 simply say                                 if we have to we can publicly shame                                 someone we can remove them                                 from our contributors to a project that                                 someone if if                                 they are egregiously infringing our                                 trademark let me be clear                                 this is only a final step we can remove                                 them                                 from participating in a project that for                                 me is far more powerful                                 at apache at this project with that                                 skill than any                                 lawsuit and it's also from our                                 perspective is                                 open source group much more practical to                                 do because it doesn't require the                                 legal expertise and the money                                 so of course um a main issue we                                 we think about when we think about                                 trademarks is uh what happens when                                 somebody                                 misuses our mark how do we go about                                 fixing it they actually the first                                 question is                                 how are you going to discover those                                 things so                                 once some company and the typical case                                 here that i've seen                                 dozens of times is that either a big                                 company sometimes are usually smaller                                 companies                                 ones that are looking to grow quickly                                 will either purposefully                                 or unknowingly co-opt                                 an open source project's reputation                                 their trademarks their brand                                 whatever in their own products and then                                 trying to sell them effectively                                 competing with you by                                 using your software which is okay and                                 also effectively using your                                 trademarks which is not okay the trick                                 is                                 correcting these things both in the                                 overall perspective                                 and in the perspective from the                                 infringer becomes                                 geometrically or exponentially harder                                 the longer a potential infringement goes                                 on                                 so is your community around your project                                 are they active would they notice if                                 some new company                                 were trying to capitalize on your brand                                 and particularly                                 in particular would they know who to                                 report it to                                 and if they do report it that you know                                 this new vc company that                                 never even talking about them and all of                                 a sudden they're now running the cloud                                 service that uses your software                                 and uses your name to drive their sales                                 we might have heard that recently in the                                 news                                 how would you find out about that and                                 when you do with the community which is                                 what we really can rely on                                 let the right people in your                                 organization know so you can say okay                                 yes this is a problem yes we need to                                 address it                                 and we need to go uh you know get an                                 officer from our                                 organization to start talking with the                                 company right uh do you have the                                 processes around                                 do you have a trademark policy that's                                 back a couple slides                                 do you have the process to how to                                 address infringements so                                 at the asf we have a clear process we                                 have a volunteer right vp of brand                                 management who is responsible for this                                 and some volunteers that help them                                 we have an expert council and retainer                                 who we really don't use very often for                                 this                                 but even in that case it's still an                                 issue for all of apache's                                              to be effective at collecting these                                 things and bringing them up                                 so an important structural thing is to                                 think about                                 how was your com how would your                                 organization how would your project                                 whatever you have address misuses of                                 your                                 brands                                 um so one of the things we always people                                 always ask about are trademark                                 registrations are they important can i                                 just go trademark something                                 uh the lawyers are now twitching because                                 i said trademark is a verb                                 it's not a verb registrations are like                                 an insurance policy                                 the issue is that it takes a long time                                 to get your policy actually written                                 so you you have a trademark and you can                                 go apply                                 to various national registries and of                                 course it's different in every country                                 or across the eu                                 um but it takes the uspto                                 which does trademarks uh at least six                                 months if not longer to even sort of                                 get around to your application and if                                 there are questions then                                 much longer so you you can't you can't                                 i've seen                                 a number of projects where oh my                                 goodness somebody's misusing our brand                                 and it's hard to deal with oh let's go                                 make it a registry registration well                                 it's kind of too late at that point                                 um the trick here is                                 if you're a commercial company you could                                 just go register in a bunch of countries                                 as open source projects we don't have                                 those resources                                 so the trick will be to figure out which                                 countries are really important for your                                 contributor base i.e which countries do                                 you want to make sure that you can                                 really protect your trademark                                 for people who are going to come to                                 contribute to your project because                                 that's really the most important thing                                 for open source projects is bringing in                                 new contributors                                 um the good thing about registrations is                                 once you have a registration granted                                 that is actually                                 issued by some country's authority it's                                 very hard                                 to take it away from you very very hard                                 so                                 in the small scale that gives you a                                 really strong defense                                 in the countries you get registered in                                 that unfortunately does not necessarily                                 legally                                 protect you in other countries there                                 certainly are some legal aspects to it                                 but                                 those really aren't very important what                                 really is important is that you can                                 continue to use your brand in your key                                 countries and then that your reputation                                 can uh ensure that people still come                                 find you instead of somebody else                                 although again usually business is uh                                 another                                 good thing about registrations that's                                 that's you don't think about is                                 um businesses usually have lawyers who                                 who will check registered marks                                 before naming products so that they'll                                 avoid you to start with right it's a                                 it's a sort of a                                 a big moat in a number of ways                                 that prevent people from starting to                                 misuse your brand or your trademarks                                 um and                                 so don't go to court uh as the the                                 lesson but so everybody out there                                 raise your hand if you're yeah pretend                                 pretend we're all in a room together                                 again that'd be awesome                                 raise your hand if your organization                                 your open source project has a trademark                                 lawyer                                 on retainer right so you actually could                                 call them and they would just                                 talk to you right it might take a little                                 while but okay now keep your hand raised                                 if you have the budget to pay                                 that lawyer for a week's worth of work                                 do you have you actually                                 got that cash and you have it budgeted                                 for legal work                                 okay now keep your hand up you can put                                 your hand down if you don't have that                                 keep your hand up if you also have the                                 leadership capacity in your organization                                 uh to manage a lawsuit                                 right to work with that lawyer to gather                                 evidence from your website from                                 whatever and whoever's infringing on you                                 that you want to sue gather from their                                 website                                 uh to address legal questions right the                                 lawyer's gonna say                                 can we claim this or not can you show us                                 proof                                 for most of us if if you think you have                                 to go to court                                 um most open source organizations                                 non-profits                                 you've already lost because it's far too                                 expensive                                 um and far too much of a drain on your                                 organizational leadership to be                                 effective at a trademark                                 lawsuit um so i guess that the point is                                 i really hope it never comes to this                                 point um the good question is                                 it usually doesn't um if you                                 if you do the practical steps here uh in                                 this talk                                 then it takes certainly takes time and                                 there are                                 a number of cases where we've had                                 private negotiations going on for quite                                 a while with                                 a commercial company that's infringing                                 on one of our marks um                                 but they have all worked out in in                                 admittedly a small case there right this                                 is not covering everybody in open source                                 um but that does work because                                 for any any of us who have a reasonable                                 uh reputation a reasonable scope of the                                 technologies that our project                                 participates in uh if we find the right                                 people in some infringing company                                 to show sure you're making money off of                                 this                                 um you know co-opting some open source                                 project's name right to go sell                                 something                                 uh but the bigger technical question is                                 that's great for your quarterly sales                                 but how's the rest of the open source                                 community seeing you are other                                 foundations going to want to accept your                                 projects                                 are you going to draw in new open source                                 talent well                                 if you're a company that's that's shown                                 to be abusing of other open source                                 either                                 licenses or trademarks um                                 open source talent is a huge huge                                 question and people pay attention to                                 that                                 obviously everybody coming to fosback's                                 age probably already                                 knows that intuitively but that's an                                 important part                                 in large companies thinking about their                                 internal operations                                 you just need to find the right person                                 inside the company who can                                 tie together that the technology aspect                                 the talent aspect                                 and then the public image aspect of sure                                 you might be making money                                 from some sales stream but you're also                                 attracting a lot of negative publicity                                 if your open if an open source project                                 is complaining publicly                                 um so that's a long one invite way to                                 say                                 for all the times we sort of start                                 talking about tiny details about                                 trademark law                                 and you know should we sue after we send                                 a cease and desist all that                                 you don't want to go to court uh you                                 know unless                                 maybe your well-funded linux foundation                                 project                                 that's not a place that an open source                                 non-profit                                 community-led group wants to be because                                 you know large corporations and large                                 budgets are what will overwhelm them                                 so those are practical                                 things that we can do many of which                                 don't involve a lawyer right you                                 probably want to get a lawyer to                                 actually file your registration to make                                 the process simpler but you don't need                                 one you actually can                                 file yourself in many countries                                 thinking about how your organization                                 uses your own marks right show that you                                 respect them and                                 ask other people with a policy to                                 respect your trademarks respect your                                 brand                                 you're free to take our code but don't                                 capitalize on our                                 social and technical capital um                                 making sure your organization has a way                                 to address these things and to detect                                 these things                                 right having an intake form just like a                                 bug report                                 for hey somebody's missed using our                                 project brand somewhere                                 those are all things that a lot of                                 projects haven't really thought about                                 but those are practical things we can do                                 with limited budget without having to do                                 lawyer use lawyers                                 that will make a difference later on                                 when                                 an issue comes up because the the other                                 two truisms are                                 once you find out about something it's                                 usually kind of late and it's much                                 harder to                                 it's much harder to fix something if you                                 find out about it later                                 and the other one is a lot of times we                                 we don't find out about things                                 um until it's way way too late but i                                 want to take a break from                                 the big practical aspects and here is a                                 list i actually don't have the right                                 chat but here's a list of the other                                 topics

       there there are a few simple things that                                 you can do uh just with your existing                                 website                                 and you're considering existing                                 marketing materials that will get you a                                 good way                                 forward um others using your marks

    worldwide and uh little blurbs on                                 misunderstood trademark topics there are                                 a couple of questions that come up all                                 the time where people are like                                 i'm like no that that's has nothing to                                 do with trademarks                                 um but here's a question where i'd like                                 to say                                 where would we like to go next so if my                                 moderator back there um has has either a                                 specific question                                 or has one of these topics that people                                 have asked about                                 um i can just go through i have three or                                 four slides for each of the topics                                 that you know there's a question on                                 registrations i'll just go through the                                 registration section and hopefully                                 they'll answer the question                                 thank you so much jane that's great uh                                 very clear high level introduction to                                 the topic                                 and uh yeah i don't see questions yet in                                 the chat                                 i'll keep monitoring that but as this is                                 a topic close to my heart                                 i haven't okay good started i'm going to                                 kick off with um                                 with elastic because uh you know it's                                 been a big                                 trending topic and i was also tweeting                                 about it in relation to this talk                                 yesterday                                 so that my question specifically is                                 about um                                 shay bannon and elastic's uh opinion on                                 trademark enforceability in their case                                 um because                                 basically what elastic have said in the                                 last two weeks is that                                 they've had to abandon an open source uh                                 compatible license according to the open                                 source definition                                 because their trademarks were not                                 enforceable against                                 uh amazon at least not yet and they                                 didn't go into detail with that                                 but um that that's against conventional                                 wisdom as far as i'm aware so i wondered                                 what your view was on this on this                                 debate okay i will i don't                                 i don't know that there is a shared                                 conventional wisdom at least                                 among us who aren't counsel um                                 so i think the the biggest                                 question is um trademarks are about                                 perception                                 so literally trademarks the the the                                 purpose of trademarks is to protect                                 consumers                                 in in a re a lot of ways they're not                                 really protect us                                 as producers it's to make sure that                                 consumers when they're going to buy                                 a ford car that they expect to be                                 reliable or a coca-cola that they expect                                 to be                                 sharp that when they buy a bottle like                                 that they'll get that flavor                                 and not the sweet flavor of pepsi um                                 correspondingly a lot of trademark                                 issues in in non-famous brands                                 and certainly in our area aren't done                                 aren't solved                                 by going to court they're solved by                                 bringing up the business pressure                                 um or by being serious enough about                                 appearing to                                 get ready to sue somebody that the other                                 person says you know it's not worth my                                 it's not worth my time and my expense to                                 defend from that so one thing i have not                                 looked                                 in detail about the elasticsearch thing                                 um                                 but i would certainly question what was                                 elasticsearch doing for the first                                 how many years was it certainly three                                 plus years where amazon was effectively                                 using elasticsearch on an amazon product                                 right what was elasticsearch happy that                                 they were getting extra                                 sales referrals were they happy that                                 they got an amazon discount was there                                 some actual agreement or did they just                                 let it happen                                 because the trick is if you let it                                 happen that long then of course the                                 other company's going to say we have                                 tons of sunk costs                                 they're going to fight back until they                                 see a serious                                 lawsuit about it from my perspective                                 elasticsearch should have                                 you know done something about it within                                 the first year right away and i think                                 that would have made a big difference                                 right                                 whether or not um legally                                 amazon they almost amazon certainly                                 almost                                 would have been in the wrong if it had                                 been addressed early but more to the                                 point a business decision on amazon's                                 part is                                 this company's going to make a stink                                 then amazon would have                                 said early on great we'll go make our                                 own thing                                 we'll we'll call it our own thing that                                 uses all your software                                 right so they would have forked the code                                 and not the name                                 and of course elastic would still have                                 ended up complaining about this                                 right i mean that's a lot of the big                                 point of people who are                                 having a hard time with with cloud                                 providers is there whether or not you're                                 using the name                                 they still want to prevent you from                                 actually using the software so that's                                 actually a separate question it would                                 help                                 anyways um but in terms of the                                 like the legal aspects of the uh                                 trademark appropriateness of either                                 amazon or elastic                                 there's a simple answer for that                                 question it depends                                 uh you know so if you if you go to a                                 trademark lawyer that's that's a common                                 joke is                                 great okay what what was actually on                                 amazon's website three years ago                                 how was it specific how was                                 elasticsearch specifically tied                                 to a product offered in commerce yes or                                 no                                 did elasticsearch have registrations at                                 the time right                                 um had elasticsearch been treating their                                 mark and had they been                                 actually going out and issuing c d                                 letters                                 or at least complaining to other                                 companies had they been attempting to                                 defend                                 it right all those things would factors                                 would end up going into any lawsuit and                                 they're all complicated uh does that                                 it does thank you thank you my next                                 question                                 which is um yeah a bit more practical                                 then and                                 perhaps uh uh more applicable about the                                 use of the symbols so you referred to                                 these symbols earlier in your talk with                                 them i wonder                                 uh when is a good time to start using uh                                 the tm symbol for example                                 because you might only be registering a                                 trademark in                                 one region for your open source project                                 because it's expensive and slow as you                                 mentioned                                 or you might not have started using the                                 symbols at all because you might not                                 for example have joined the sflc or you                                 might not have a legal entity                                 established is there a limit on when you                                 can start using tm and would you advise                                 to use it                                 early or later so let's be clear i am                                 not                                 your lawyer i'm not anybody's lawyer                                 here um                                 i only play a lawyer on the trade i only                                 play a trademark lawyer on the internet                                 so                                 um if you have start using the tm as                                 soon as you have enough of a web                                 presence                                 to have a consistent name for a specific                                 product                                 you are offering you can slap tm on                                 anything you want there's no real legal                                 penalty                                 it won't have won't have much meaning                                 until you are being consistent                                 right saying apache couchdb tm                                 software download that here right                                 because you're using couchdb                                 as a as a symbol that means this is the                                 product we're offering                                 to people right um but you can do that                                 as soon as you want and obviously in                                 in most first to use countries once you                                 start doing that                                 you can then use that as an intent to                                 use application or                                 you can you can just start showing                                 in common law that you have some rights                                 to it um first to file countries                                 probably won't really care                                 but it's still worth doing because in a                                 practical sense                                 that shows people looking at your                                 website oh they have a real product                                 right they're thinking about                                 this right company even companies will                                 say oh if they're claiming it as a                                 trademark we probably should be careful                                 about it                                 right whether or not they make a                                 business business decision to try and                                 infringe later is separate but they will                                 probably not                                 um and so one thing i                                 i thought of earlier is um in terms of                                 registrations                                 one value again trademarks are a lot                                 about perception                                 so one value of getting an issued                                 registration                                 in uh most countries i think almost                                 every country                                 allows this is once you have that                                 registration                                 issued right they have to formally give                                 you the number and all that stuff                                 you can then stick the r on your website                                 because it is registered and now it                                 might just be registered in australia                                 right but it's still registered so the                                 perception there is when when you                                 say hey you can't use our our logo like                                 that right you're                                 using it with somebody else's product                                 you can say hey this is our registered                                 trademark                                 right when another company or                                 an abuser gets that email as soon                                 most managers would forward it up to                                 legal and as soon as legal sees there's                                 a little r in it they'll say yeah don't                                 do that                                 right because the risk to them is so                                 much bigger uh than                                 not having registration a registration                                 is sort of like a legal proof                                 that you can pass around saying yes you                                 have some rights in this now                                 how strong those rights are in you know                                 russia or india if you're only                                 registered in australia                                 i don't really know but they will                                 probably make a business decision                                 to not infringe                                 so getting one registration actually is                                 a big win                                 in terms of you can then use the r i                                 don't use the r beforehand because                                 you know people actually could complain                                 about that i mean you wouldn't get in                                 trouble but if there were                                 a future lawsuit about it they would use                                 that as a                                 complaint thank you this one comes from                                 the audience it                                 speaks to elastic and mongodb it's going                                 to ask you to speculate                                 i warn you in advance the question is                                 what's                                 what's your opinion on whether the                                 strategy of these companies                                 was right from the first to change their                                 licenses later on                                 uh and presumably blame trademarks                                 as a result i i dare say you don't have                                 uh consulting relationships with those                                 firms and if you did it would be                                 confidential anyway but uh play it again                                 no i do not                                 have a relationship with either firm i                                 do not have stock in either firm either                                 um uh well from a community perspective                                 they both                                 screwed up period right when you when                                 you                                 community reputation is all about um                                 portraying who you are and then staying                                 true to that and they clearly were                                 trying to be                                 hey we're we're running this great thing                                 but we also want to be open source and                                 have community                                 oh sorry we're actually changing our                                 license no uh                                 that's just a bad decision and in terms                                 of the developer                                 uh feedback and the feedback from other                                 open source organizations                                 no we're not going to trust them and                                 that's going to certainly affect                                 who contributes um who's interested in                                 you know                                 in the next couple years of hey i want                                 to build my next search technology                                 should i                                 add this or should i add lucine or                                 whatever                                 developers are going to choose somebody                                 else partly because of that mistrust                                 in terms of blaming it on trademarks                                 that's kind of a bold                                 answer i think i suppose it might be                                 smart in a way because a lot of                                 people are gonna be kind of confused                                 trying to actually analyze                                 what that means um but it's not a not a                                 very good excuse                                 um in any case right if they were really                                 thinking about that then they should                                 have had                                 both better legal and better you know                                 brand planning                                 expertise ahead of time um so                                 no in terms of business decision i'm not                                 gonna                                 speculate on that but um i'm certainly                                 not going to be                                 working with them from my perspective so                                 yeah                                 thanks and uh i just want to sneak one                                 additional question                                 here um you mentioned public image that                                 aspect                                 for example how to communicate the                                 decision to enforce trademarks in an                                 open source project                                 i wonder if any really good examples                                 come to mind that we might learn from                                 uh i'm sure there are a couple                                 um i guess two things is one is if                                 anybody follows                                 you know legal people on twitter every                                 now and then they post a really funny                                 cease and desist letter right or really                                 interestingly written                                 decision from a judge right that says                                 you know                                 fulfills the legal requirement of stop                                 doing this or else                                 but is done in a humorous and thoughtful                                 way                                 those are are great both because you                                 know then if it gets public it can                                 go viral but also because the person                                 reading it right the people reading                                 these things when you're complaining                                 about them                                 they're people too and they also                                 think about the business part of it                                 um and something else i completely                                 forgot um                                 i guess the only other point is uh                                 when you're addressing uh an                                 infringement you're trying to get                                 somebody else to change their behavior                                 around your                                 brand your trademarks always start                                 in private right give them a chance to                                 save face                                 that that solved a ton of things                                 certainly apache and i imagine in                                 smaller cases smaller companies too                                 you say no really this is our trademark                                 here's how we'd like you to use it or                                 we would like you to not use it a lot of                                 companies will                                 respect that after it takes them a                                 little while right but they will respect                                 it                                 another key point is have an officer in                                 your organization                                 send the letter right some random                                 developer sending a letter                                 if it goes to some manager in the                                 company you know whoever the company                                 goes to                                 they're gonna be like who is this person                                 i don't really care                                 if you sign it as vice president brand                                 management the apache software                                 foundation with the big signature and                                 your logo                                 then they're like oh this is somebody                                 serious right                                 little things like that actually do make                                 a difference in terms of                                 especially how quickly they'll respond                                 and to a degree whether or not they will                                 respond right i mean                                 technically some random person doesn't                                 have rights to                                 do this for apache or for your company                                 or your organization                                 um but you know at apache we have an                                 officer for this                                 and they're the ones who send these                                 notices that actually makes a difference                                 right                                 we try not we try to have our hats of of                                 what we're representing                                 we don't have titles we're not a                                 hierarchy but                                 certainly big companies do have                                 hierarchies and they notice them                                 that's great thank you so shane thank                                 you again for the whole session                                  you
