Title: #FOSSBack Keith Bergelt - OS Technical and Patent Collaboration in Parallel & Patent Risk Mitigation
Publication date: 2021-03-01
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Given the nature of collaborative development of Open Source Software (OSS) in projects, projects must ensure that technical development occurs along with legal cooperation between developers and users.  Participation in technology development through OSS requires that we look to community solutions for patent risk mitigation.


Participants will be introduced to the Open Invention Network and develop an understanding of the organization’s mission, free membership, community initiatives, and support of OSS innovation through projects.

	                              the parallelism                               that exists obviously everybody's                               familiar with the technical side of open                               source you have                               uh individuals collaborating and the                               modality of                               of that collaboration creating kind of                               new novelty where                               it otherwise couldn't exist uh is                                uh is a critical uh kind of                                transformational                                uh movement in terms of uh                                of crossing geographic lines crossing uh                                lines uh uh between uh countries and                                individuals                                uh that uh maybe don't get along so well                                there's a meeting in the middle that                                happens around                                uh around the technical collaboration of                                open source                                it's a very special experience uh it's                                actually                                uh something that i think a lot of                                people                                in government and even leadership and                                organizations don't fully understand                                how powerful this movement is it's a                                social movement                                that uh that creates new novelty through                                the idea that that anyone can come                                together and build on each other's ideas                                it kind of stems from the                                the basic uh and most uh                                uh most uh fundamental uh                                kind of desire to be able to distill the                                collective intelligence                                of a of an organization of a community                                of multiple organizations                                and individuals to be able to create                                something that couldn't otherwise be                                created and i think it's a                                it in and of itself is uh is uh                                of monumental significance in terms of                                how societies                                uh are working to be able to create uh                                ideas i think if we look i just had a                                call two days ago                                with uh people working uh in the u.s                                government on uh                                a task force uh focused on                                on sharing uh knowledge information                                uh related to the development of                                vaccines                                um and so i think this is uh uh                                particularly uh important area                                uh for people to focus on um                                so essentially you know we're we all                                have                                an understanding of how this process                                works but                                what sometimes is lost is how i mean                                that you know                                clearly just kind of reinforcing a point                                or two that i made is that                                the the spread the scope the diffusion                                of open source technology is so                                uh significant that every electronic                                touch we have is enabled by open source                                and i think a lot of people                                because of branding and because of the                                people looking at what chrome is and not                                really understanding                                what what drives chrome uh what the                                chromium platform is                                and and then they understand android                                because it's well branded                                uh and all of the other in contact                                points that we have if we do a google                                search                                uh stoplights we cross at uh all the                                platforms that are developed to support                                uh autonomous driving air traffic                                control systems                                so many environments in which we're in                                on a daily basis                                we have uh a uh                                an opportunity to uh to enjoy and                                experience the                                the fruits of the collaborative                                development that i talked about earlier                                um and i think you know clearly                                i think people on this call people in                                this community understand                                that software is rising and the uh                                as we've grown uh open invention network                                has grown and the community's grown                                we've been able to understand the uh and                                appreciate                                the the fact that more and more                                 industries are being affected                                 and you think about the auto industry                                 and the auto industry recognized that                                 uh as jim zemlin is fond of saying that                                 it was                                 essentially being disintermediated by a                                 smartphone and a piece of velcro                                 and there's been a significant                                 transition now that automotive grade                                 linux                                 uh has emerged as a significant project                                 to be able to allow for                                 uh vehicles not only the cabin of the                                 vehicle but                                 everything all the mission critical uh                                 applications within the vehicle are are                                 increasingly moving toward                                 uh running on the common platform uh the                                 agl platform which is                                 which is built on top of uh the linux                                 kernel                                 i think this kind of uh of movement is                                 not                                 uh not isolated to the to this kind of                                 new                                 new reality for the auto industry but                                 it's for every industry that we                                 encounter that has historically been                                 hardware                                 centric is now software centric and so                                 uh it's creating a perfect storm if you                                 will                                 for more collaboration more                                 opportunities for open source to                                 proliferate                                 um and that collaboration is creating                                 connectivity that again gets to this                                 idea of a distilled collective                                 intelligence                                 uh not only just in a company but across                                 a country                                 and across uh national lines to include                                 the entire world                                 of of contributors uh and it drives a                                 higher level invented                                 of inventiveness and innovation                                 uh and so this is just an example of the                                 kinds of projects that we support there                                 are literally hundreds of projects that                                 we support                                 uh and in the parallelism that uh                                 that i wanted to talk about is really                                 the fact that                                 what happens in the technical side this                                 kind of                                 uh viral and i hesitate using that term                                 in the current environment but this                                 viral                                 uh level of innovation and creativity                                 uh the organic nature of it uh there's a                                 there's a parallel among the uh the                                 people who are                                 helping on compliance and governance                                 inside companies                                 uh from the illegal arena                                 as well as people who focus on patent                                 risk management intellectual property                                 in general is a major focus of uh                                 of uh of the                                 linux foundation uh uh and other uh                                 other organizations that manage projects                                 apache                                 uh and others i think there's a there's                                 a recognition that                                 uh early on probably                                                  this is                                 obviously it's a movement that's                                         years old but                                 this movement from uh from the                                 enterprise                                 out beyond to uh uh to look at uh                                 all the applications that are                                 represented here and many many more                                 in terms of environments and sectors uh                                 that movement uh                                 is one that created an opportunity um                                 for uh for                                 adoption of code for many many more                                 companies and i think                                 uh                                                           a recognition that this was possible but                                 i don't think anybody in their wildest                                 dreams expected that                                 that there'd be such a proliferation and                                 so that means that there's so many                                 companies                                 uh many of them large companies uh that                                 have had many issues over their                                 histories with patents                                 uh patent litigation being asserted                                 against having to pay                                 uh royalties uh there was a real concern                                 back                                                      uh that the adoption of open source code                                 might be slowed or stalled by                                 uh individual threats and threateners                                 companies uh                                 at that time uh because of rhetoric and                                 because of actions                                 and because of patents in their                                 portfolio microsoft was the                                 considered the monolithic threat uh and                                 uh and up until just a few years ago                                 when it joined the uh                                 the actually a little over two years ago                                 when it joined the uh                                 the uh oin community and agreed to make                                 its patents subject to cross license                                 there was great concern prior to that uh                                 about                                 what could be done by companies that are                                 wedded to proprietary                                 and uh highly resistant up until that                                 point                                 of utilizing and adopting open source                                 code and what that would mean                                 for uh projects like this when core code                                 is introduced                                 uh the way it should work is that by                                 that that code is picked up                                 by individual companies adopted                                 incorporated into uh products                                 uh and uh there was a fear                                              that that actually wouldn't occur                                 um and so um there had to be an                                 agreement a compact                                 uh between companies around how they                                 would manage                                 uh their just as as exists on the                                 copyright                                 side uh there are obligations that go                                 along with the opportunity                                 of open source adoption uh then                                 that are legal and uh and create need                                 for governance programs and                                 compliance and and has given rise to                                 welcome all matter of tools being                                 developed as well as                                 uh uh now the uh the quite recent iso                                 standard                                 uh that's been applied to uh                                 to open chain which is                                 all geared toward creating a sustainable                                 repeatable                                 normalized process for uh                                 managing code under the various licenses                                 uh that exists and in parallel there's                                 there's the the in the legal community                                 there's been an and an activity over the                                 last                                          it's very specific and and purposeful to                                 ensure that                                 that comfort could be had around the                                 adoption of code                                 and freedom from litigation                                 uh and this is an environment that is                                 one that                                 is very much uh uh                                 partaking of a certain duality there are                                 certain notions that were developed in                                 the                                                                  around the idea of coopetation we'll                                 cooperate                                 uh we cooperate and compete uh to                                 compete more effectively we cooperate                                 with each other and that was really                                 around                                 almost joint ventures uh maybe                                 multi-party                                 party activity but nothing that back                                 then that could be conceptualized                                 uh as fulsomely as as what open source                                 is                                 in terms of this very broad scale uh                                 uh hundreds of companies participating                                 in individual projects                                 uh and developing code that could be                                 commonly exploited and used                                 and so um this world is not one where                                 intellectual property goes away people                                 if they choose to can still                                 differentiate based on                                 patenting but there's a notion of where                                 that becomes appropriate and where                                 that's inappropriate                                 because where we collaborate and build                                 on each other's ideas in the core                                 of open source we need to be able to                                 have freedom of action and a                                 freedom to know that that adopting that                                 code is not going to create                                 patent issues and create uh unwanted uh                                 taxes or tariffs uh in the form of uh of                                 licensing fees or                                 uh or litigation settlements                                 and so it was important at that point                                    years ago to be able to                                 introduce something that could help uh                                 provide that measure of support                                 as an increasing number of companies                                 from new                                 sectors uh that were not terribly                                 familiar with open source and had hadn't                                 been as software centric as they've                                 become                                 over this last                                                          that comfort                                 [Music]                                 and essentially there's this practice                                 form of duality                                 that individuals that are responsible                                 for intellectual property strategy in a                                 company                                 have have needed to to adopt as a result                                 of the uh                                 the proliferation of open source uh and                                 part of that uh that adoption or                                 or adjustment is                                 to understand uh where it's important                                 for                                 global collaboration to be able to solve                                 problems                                 and increasingly you're seeing companies                                 participate in this in these kinds of                                 activities                                 oin is the largest patent non-aggression                                 community in history                                 it was started in o                                                     work for this was done a couple of years                                 prior                                 and ibm red hat sauce                                 nec sony and phillips were the original                                 founder                                 funding founding members google and                                 toyota came                                 on a little bit later uh as                                 open source uh became uh increasingly                                 critical                                 for them uh as i said automotive grade                                 linux                                 was launched uh several years ago                                 and at that time toyota came in uh                                 and and wanted to put a stake in the                                 ground to

                                history of of technology where companies                                 of                                                              have come together from startups to the                                 largest corporations in it in the world                                 uh and they have come together to be                                 able to                                 agree on that basic principle that where                                 we collaborate                                 where we build on each other's ideas we                                 we should                                 basically not be suing each other and uh                                 it's a it's a pretty simple concept                                 there's no fee                                 associated with this this model uh                                 it's really just about a behavior uh                                 people coming together to recognize that                                 their interests are driven                                 by collaboration uh and                                 and in the increased innovation that                                 comes from it                                 and the opportunity to be able to work                                 together                                 out into the future uh we own patents                                 that we've purchased for the purpose of                                 uh                                 of uh reducing risk                                 um we own pat many patents historically                                 that                                 read on threat noise like microsoft that                                 we could convey to companies at risk or                                 in litigation                                 uh as we did uh as one example                                 uh a number of years ago when salesforce                                 was being sued on                                 uh on patents that read on open source                                 functionality                                 that were owned by microsoft we conveyed                                 them patents and allowed them to                                 properly defend

                            so we still own at this point over a                                 thousand patents and applications                                 that read on uh on critical

which has been a very important part of                                 our deterrence particularly during                                 this period when operating company risk                                 was most acute                                 uh and prior to microsoft's becoming a                                 participant you know and community                                 uh we

obviously apache eclipse openstack                                 uh linux foundation uh and we'll work                                 with new projects as well                                 whenever a project management                                 organization is launched                                 uh and there are interesting uh                                 um uh interesting subject matter in                                 terms of                                 uh what the focuses of projects uh we                                 will reach out as we have with open atom                                 uh to be able to ensure that we are                                 aware                                 of whatever core code they produce                                 from the various projects that they                                 manage and then we'll look to                                 uh to evaluate that code                                 we have a internal technical committee                                 that's one representative from each of                                 our member companies our funding member                                 companies                                 and then we have a a broader uh                                 technical advisory council                                 which is made up of licensees from                                 across the world that have                                 have particular knowledge and experience                                 in                                 in some of the important projects that                                 that have been launched                                 and we try to bring those companies in                                 to be able to work with our technical                                 committee                                 to ensure that we're properly                                 identifying code that should be included                                 in the linux system definition                                 again the scope of the cross license and                                 uh                                 and that we can properly uh work                                 together to be able to vet                                 those nominations that have been made to                                 ensure that they truly are                                 core and uh and that we're not                                 artificially                                 uh uh covering and uh                                 and incorporating into into the cross                                 license what would be                                 considered appropriately proprietary                                 technology uh                                 again the world the world is is is                                 really about duality                                 uh there are that there are innovations                                 that                                 companies are differentiating on and if                                 that's                                 the course that they choose to take they                                 should have the right to do that                                 because the laws allow them to do that                                 uh                                 in various jurisdictions and so um i                                 think you know there are                                 there are many good uh there's much good                                 evidence over the last                                 since the american events act uh in                                      of uh of a world which is creating more                                 uh more quality in the patent system                                 and reducing the amount of noise from                                 poor quality                                 uh patents uh it's not perfect but                                 uh i think if uh if individuals continue                                 to work                                 uh in washington and uh at the uh                                 with dg comp and uh                                 and uh in europe and mafcom and other                                 other uh bodies around the world to                                 ensure that there's less and less noise                                 and also obviously work with the                                 patented trademark offices                                 uh uh it's very important that we work                                 together to create                                 a good uh definition of what uh                                 of what is uh a patentable subject                                 matter                                 and so as an aside i think it's great                                 when companies                                 uh share their views with uh with                                 government to                                 uh to try to create a better environment                                 um and more definition uh that helps                                 with quality uh                                 around the patent system and so                                 um the patent freedom                                 that we're providing for open source                                 projects                                 uh is very much um                                 parallel to the uh collaborative                                 development work that goes on inside                                 these projects                                 uh and project and that are managed by                                 these project management organizations                                 and so                                 uh you have hundreds of very significant                                 projects thousands of total projects uh                                 and uh we have code from many many many                                 uh all of the entities represented here                                 not open adam                                 because none of their projects are                                 mature enough yet but uh                                 at some point we'll probably have code                                 from open atom                                 as well that we want to incorporate we                                 have many many licensees from china                                 uh in excess of

                these are entities that are relying                                 heavily on open source                                 uh and our participants in the oin

                establishing around appropriate                                 behavior uh in the use of patents in an                                 open source setting                                 and context uh even companies you know                                 very surprising                                 uh when i first met with caterpillar and                                 and                                 kamatsu and others just uh five or six                                 years ago                                 but they were really starting to                                 understand and very very solicitous                                 to understand how they could start to                                 utilize                                 more software to be able to create safer                                 environments                                 for the operators uh and in some cases                                 to                                 to supplant the operation uh where uh                                 it's particularly dangerous                                 uh where uh where risk is uh is common                                 associated with the use of heavy                                 equipment and they are                                 participants in our community and and                                 very uh                                 deeply committed to uh increasing                                 software                                 intensity in their products um                                 and then obviously in the energy sector                                 uh lf energy                                 is a driver in these kinds of companies                                 participating                                 and we expect that this will be a                                 significant growth area                                 uh into the future just as the banking                                 community                                 financial services we'll see a lot of                                 growth over the next year in terms of                                 adoption of open source code and then                                 participation in uh                                 in the oin community as a recognition                                 that this                                 is part and parcel of uh of the                                 opportunity                                 opportunities and open source have                                 obligations it's a social movement                                 and uh part of that that obligation is                                 to                                 to behave well from a copyright                                 standpoint to utilize tools and                                 processes that are being developed to                                 to maintain compliance uh at the same                                 time                                 uh on the patent side uh to uh to                                 participate                                 as a citizen of the community an                                 appropriate way                                 uh because at the end of the day the                                 only companies that don't join the oan                                 community                                 uh are companies that are uh that wish                                 to reserve the right to sue on core                                 linux and associated open source                                 functionality                                 and i don't think uh when a company                                 looks hard in the mirror                                 uh that there are many that should be                                 answering that question in the                                 affirmative                                 uh but uh but nonetheless you know                                      is                                 is a significant number of companies                                 participating                                 but uh but we continue to grow and                                 continue to look for more companies                                 to recognize that their interests are in                                 collaboration                                 on the legal front just as they are in                                 collaboration on the technical front                                 there are a number of reasons to join                                 many of them are                                 implicit in what i've just described uh                                 obviously the fact that it's that                                 there's zero                                 monetary cost is very significant for                                 companies                                 particularly small to medium-sized                                 companies of which we have                                 literally thousands uh in our community                                 um but the patent risk mitigation issues                                 i think                                 are our role in safeguarding uh patent                                 the companies that are adopting open                                 source code and enabling them to feel                                 more comfortable                                 as they move into uh becoming more                                 software centric and more open source                                 centric as a result                                 this is one of the the key benefits uh                                 and uh that adoption is something that                                 that's really been central to the growth                                 of i think the linux foundation                                 and the other project management                                 organizations that i mentioned                                 uh i think you know                                                   years ago                                 you really had very little                                 um uh professional management i'd say                                 uh of of projects at the level that you                                 find it now i think                                 uh we've always had very significant                                 sophisticated projects uh                                 but i think there was there was a                                 transition point                                 uh when eclipse and and linux foundation                                 uh                                 started to become really focused on                                 on the curating projects uh                                 and working with companies in ways that                                 they were perhaps                                 not comfortable in working uh before uh                                 in participating in projects as                                 aggressively and as actively as they do                                 but now you see no barriers                                 to companies participating and no                                 barriers to their adoption                                 and oin plays no small role in ensuring                                 the latter                                 as we are there to specifically                                 encourage                                 adoption and and remove a fear                                 the fear of litigation um that                                 that companies have faced and again                                 paying a uh                                 a duty or a tax for adoption of open                                 source code                                 and so in addition we provide defensive                                 support we work with many entities                                 uh uh we've worked with the gnome                                 foundation                                 in the last couple of years when they                                 were uh being uh sued by                                 uh the rothschild patent troll uh and we                                 work with them in the background                                 i think you know they did an excellent                                 job                                 uh from the director uh all the way                                 through that foundation they did an                                 excellent job                                 in working with outside counsel securing                                 outside council                                 drawing community support and uh and                                 managing that to a very very successful                                 result                                 but it just shows what working together                                 and collaboration can do                                 uh when when you're at risk or in                                 litigation and so                                 we've supported well over                                    uh litigation or assertion activities                                 where we are coming to the aid of                                 companies that are being sued or                                 asserted against                                 on by patent holders seeking to                                 to be able to extract returns                                 and we have worked with the community                                 to be able to identify prior art we have                                 uh                                 been involved in as one of the leaders                                 in uh                                 in the us and utilizing the pre-issuance                                 submission program                                 attacking poor quality patent                                 applications that are overly broad and                                 potentially dangerous if granted                                 uh we have identified uh prior art                                 from the community uh to be able to                                 transfer that to                                 patent examiners so that they could                                 reject patent applications outright                                 or at least scale back the scope of uh                                 of the patent claims the patent                                 application claims                                 before granting patents that weren't                                 outright rejected                                 and so uh this has been an important                                 part of our activity                                 uh in addition we have been working with                                 uh                                 we brought together uh what would have                                 been very strange bedfellows five or six                                 years ago                                 uh but we brought together um two very                                 significant operating companies                                 uh ibm and microsoft to work with us                                 and the linux foundation uh to be able                                 to                                 uh engage in in authoring uh                                 founding the uh the open source zone                                 under unified patents which is an entity                                 that performs a significant amount of                                 work uh                                 reducing risk in various zones uh                                 in establishing the open source zone uh                                 they have uh                                 uh they have been working uh to be able                                 to                                 uh uh invalidate poor quality patents                                 held by uh non-practicing entities                                 uh that were you being used in                                 litigation                                 uh there are literally over a dozen                                 uh situations that they've intervened                                 to be able to uh reduce risk associated                                 with non-practicing entity                                 uh held assets that read on linux system                                 linux uh and open source related                                 functionality                                 and so uh that's been a very uh                                 important relationship for us                                 and one that's helped in our                                 transformation                                 from looking primarily at uh                                 since our foundation founding looking                                 primarily at                                 operating company risk to now pivoting                                 over the last two years since microsoft                                 became a participant in our community                                 to focusing a significant amount of                                 attention on                                 on non-practicing entity risk as more                                 and more companies                                 recognize their uh their fortunes rise                                 and fall                                 with open source uh and software in                                 general uh                                 there's been a level of a natural                                 uh reduction of risk associated with                                 operating companies                                 there still are operating company uh                                 risks out there                                 that we are working to uh to uh                                 diffuse but at the same time we                                 recognize that                                 uh patents are being sold and continuing                                 to be                                 sold by operating companies that can can                                 no longer use them in this in this                                 context                                 to third parties uh and generally                                 non-practicing entities                                 that will look to uh to utilize the                                 patents to sue                                 and extract rents from the open source                                 community                                 or whom whichever targets they can                                 ultimately find and so                                 open source is just is not necessarily                                 their                                 their maybe their prime directive since                                 they are equal opportunity litigants                                 uh but uh but nonetheless uh because                                 open source is so successful                                 uh you know it it is uh it is becoming                                 increasingly a target from                                 non-practicing entities                                 and that's why what we're doing with uh                                 with unified is so important                                 uh to be able to balance and can                                 complement                                 what we do before patents are granted                                 the pre-issuance program                                 we're working also after patents are are                                 granted to be able to ensure that they                                 are                                 uh that risk is mitigated associated                                 with them the other thing that's that's                                 really happened over there                                 yeah sorry to interrupt we're just uh                                 almost at time we've got four minutes                                 for questions and we've had several                                 questions from the audience                                 okay uh i hope you just forgive me                                 interrupting you there too                                 great so the first question is about                                 research facilities that hold patents                                 and whether or not they're eligible to                                 join the oin                                 as well yes individuals research                                 facilities                                 um we've had all manner of participants                                 from one-person organizations uh to                                 to you know obviously the largest                                 organizations in the world                                 but we encourage entities like cern and                                 others to you know we'd love to have                                 that kind of participation                                 from company from entities that have                                 really been driving the edge of open                                 source for                                 for decades great that's nice and clear                                 and another question from the audience                                 was do oin members they say                                 still sue non-oin members over linux                                 related patents i'm not familiar with                                 the history of that but uh                                 are you familiar with cases where                                 non-oin members have been                                 sued by oin members over patents                                 relating to the linux system                                 we're an oan                                 i know of a couple of cases where oin                                 members have sued each other but not on                                 open source functionality                                 and so i mean oracle google                                 as an example but that was about open                                 source functionality and i don't know of                                 cases where                                 and a company in the oin community has                                 sued somebody                                 on open source grounds uh                                 a suit a non-participant uh that could                                 happen                                 because they're not they're not buying                                 into the same                                 compact if you will the same obligations                                 the same                                 belief system um and they're creating                                 their own vulnerability we can't control                                 that but it could happen but i don't                                 know of cases where it has happened                                 okay thank you another question is                                 um why not extend the oin pledge                                 to require that members either simply                                 don't sue at all over the patents that                                 they hold relating to the linux system                                 or that at least they will not sue open                                 source                                 projects whatever definition that might                                 have                                 why why not extend uh the freedom as it                                 were in that way                                 well i think the the the former kind of                                 comment it                                 it does you are prevented from suing                                 uh with your patents another entity                                 on linux system grounds within the                                 community                                 and so the idea is to create a bigger                                 community so that there are fewer and                                 fewer people that are outside the                                 community                                 people that are outside the community i                                 guess the question is should we be                                 preventing people inside the community                                 from suing anyone outside the community                                 even if they haven't joined                                 well i mean that they should join                                 because it's free                                 and because why do we want to inoculate                                 people who don't have shared values                                 and are not willing to do the same thing                                 that everyone else has done if                                 ibm with whatever                                                    huawei with                                                            of these are                                  these are massive companies that are                                  that are pledging their portfolios                                  so why would we protect someone who                                  doesn't want to take that that minimal                                  step                                  in the interest of fairness then from                                  from that perspective yeah                                  we don't want to see litigation uh but                                  at the same time we want to see people                                  sharing the same values                                  yep thank you                                  you
