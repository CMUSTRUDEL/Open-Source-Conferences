Title: #FOSSBack: Aaron Williamson - Stress-Testing the Open Source Definition
Publication date: 2021-03-01
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	For over 20 years, the Open Source Definition (OSD) has largely defined which licenses are fit for use by collaborative software communities. While there have been many efforts to stretch the definition of open source -- from "source available" to "do no evil" licenses -- incompatibility with the OSD has fatally marginalized most of these efforts. Today, two licensing movements in particular challenge the ascendency of the OSD. On the one hand, startups building SaaS components are moving from open source licenses to more restrictive licenses like the Server-Side Public License (SSPL) to protect their profits from SaaS platform vendors. On the other, the growing ethical source movement seeks to use software licenses as a tool to discourage harmful uses of community-developed software. This talk will discuss the role of the OSD in maintaining license orthodoxy and how these trends test that orthodoxy.

	                              um so                               originally i was going to talk about a                               pretty boring topic which is                               just sort of like the basics of free and                               open source software licensing but                               uh nina suggested um that maybe i could                               cover                               uh one of the more controversial uh                               legal topics                                in the community these days which is um                                which is                                licenses like the commons clause and the                                server side public license                                that uh that are efforts by businesses                                who use                                open source as sort of a business model                                to                                um to essentially exclude                                competition build a moat around their                                businesses etc                                and that sounded uh more interesting to                                me                                um and so here we are this is going to                                be a little bit of an experimental talk                                because it's not                                um you know i'm a lawyer but i'm not                                going to get too                                deep into the weeds of the licenses or                                the law                                um instead i wanted to take this                                opportunity to                                think about how we should think about                                these licensing trends that are                                sort of ascendant in our community right                                now one being these sort of                                business friendly licenses um that may                                or may not be open source                                um and the other being uh ethical source                                licenses                                um that have cropped up uh repeatedly in                                the last                                several years so uh title of my talk is                                stress testing the open source                                definition                                uh so we're gonna start uh at a pretty                                basic level which is what is an open                                source license                                there's general agreement that it's any                                license that complies with the open                                source                                definition that's published by the open                                source initiative now of course the free                                software movement                                uh has its own version of this the free                                software definition                                uh generally considered to be                                essentially the same                                in its uh in its generalities                                uh if it's expressed differently um so                                a an open source license is a license                                that complies with the open source                                definition                                now practically it also helps a lot if                                the license is                                certified to comply with the open source                                definition by the open source initiative                                which publishes the open source                                definition                                and maintains a license review process                                for                                determining and certifying whether a                                particular particular license                                is compliant with the open source                                definition                                so we can say that in reality or in all                                practical reality open source software                                therefore means software that's licensed                                under an open source or an osi approved                                license                                beyond just complying with the                                definition now open source licenses are                                often referred to                                as the constitutions of open source                                projects                                but in reality in my opinion the open                                source definition is really a lot more                                like a constitution in the national                                legal structure sense than a license is                                because it's a general statement of                                high-level principles that the more                                specific rules found in licenses                                need to conform to um there can be a                                pretty wide variety in the specific                                rules that we have in the licenses                                but the open source definition changes                                very slowly uh                                by design it doesn't vary much                                from year to year in fact it's only                                changed once in the last                                          now if you've never gotten into the                                 weeds of applying the open source                                 definition                                 to open source licenses then it might be                                 easy to assume that it's obvious uh how                                 the open source definition applies to a                                 particular license                                 uh but if you have gotten into the weeds                                 you know that it's not                                 all that easy and that's because the                                 open source                                 definition is a statement of general                                 principles it's meant to state the                                 tenets of open source licensing in a                                 succinct way but in a way that provides                                 room for useful variation between                                 licenses                                 in the same way that a constitution does                                 with regard to laws it sets out the                                 basic principles                                 um you can do anything you want to                                 within those principles                                 but don't step outside of them so it                                 says things like this                                 uh one of its one of its tenets the                                 first one                                 is free redistribution so an open source                                 license uh shall not restrict any party                                 from selling or giving away                                 software as a component of an aggregate                                 software distribution                                 containing programs from several                                 different sources the license shall not                                 require royalty                                 or other flat fee for such set or other                                 fee for such sale                                 so that makes sense to be open source                                 your software's license has to permit                                 royalty-free redistribution of your                                 software uh including in commercial                                 products                                 a pretty well understood tenant of                                 open source licensing                                 but you can already see the open source                                 definitions sort of beginning to fray                                 around the edges with time                                 the only software delivery model                                 contemplated by this or any other rule                                 is distribution of software software as                                 a service                                 isn't even a twinkle in the open source                                 definitions i at the time that it                                 is adopted first in                                       then you come to a rule like rule six                                 which is no discrimination against                                 fields of endeavor                                 the license may not restrict anyone from                                 making a use of a program                                 in a specific field of endeavor for                                 example it may not restrict the program                                 from being used in the business                                 or from being used for genetic research                                 wow                                 what's a field of endeavor seems pretty                                 broad                                 we know it includes two things business                                 and genetic research                                 what else might fit in there you won't                                 find the answer in the open source                                 definition                                 instead like the us constitution the                                 answers can only be found in                                 sort of the interpretive history of the                                 open source definition                                 and a lot of the raw materials of that                                 history can be found in the archives of                                 the open source initiatives license                                 review mailing list                                 this is sort of the case law of open                                 source license review if the open source                                 definition is the constitution open                                 source licenses are the law                                 then this is uh the interpretation of                                 the                                 constitution to the law by judges                                 um and like cases in our legal system                                 and i'm going to apologize i realize we                                 have a lot of people in europe and                                 throughout the world and i'm going to be                                 referring                                 uh as as a metaphor to the united states                                 legal system a lot i hope that you'll                                 forgive me for that but it's the one                                 that i happen to know and practice in                                 um but uh again if the                                 open source license review list is uh                                 the case law                                 of our licensing system um                                 then like cases in our life and our                                 legal system                                 uh it evolves as it gets processed                                 through successive generations of human                                 brains that develop a                                 develop in a changing cultural context                                 and come to                                 sort of a an evolving understanding of                                 what a license means and what it ought                                 to mean                                 and what the open source definition                                 ought to mean uh in the particular                                 context that they come up in                                 and uh i think it's worth thinking about                                 how that context has changed                                 uh in the time since the open source                                 definition was adopted in                                      and today                                 but despite the sort of gradual                                 evolution and interpretation of the open                                 source definition                                 the open source definition is a                                 fundamentally conservative                                 document again that's by design                                 like the constitution it's supposed to                                 be resistant to change                                 as a result of the passions of the age                                 and as anyone who's been on the open                                 source initiatives license review list                                 for a decade will tell you passions                                 flare from time to time                                 in our society as they do in any society                                 the same ideas keep coming up over and                                 over again as though the community                                 develops amnesia every few years which                                 makes sense                                 new people join the community every day                                 and it takes time for them to absorb its                                 history                                 now this talk is about two ideas that                                 have come up before                                 in the open source license                                 licensing consideration community                                 ethical source licenses and licenses                                 in the open source style that attempt to                                 limit                                 commercial competition                                 now as early as                                                        titiano mangotti the developer of a                                 nutella client you may remember nutella                                 as a                                 free software uh sort of napster type                                 uh tool um anyway                                 the the client was called gpu and this                                 developer added a                                 so-called asimov license to the project                                 license                                 seeking to prevent military use                                 by providing that the program and its                                 derivative work                                 will never be modified or executed to                                 harm any human being                                 nor through inaction permit any human                                 being                                 uh to be harmed so this is one of the                                 one of the                                 laws of robotics from from isaac                                 asimov's uh                                 universe and and it was applied by this                                 developer and has been applied by other                                 developers since                                 to software uh as as a as a statement to                                 to try and prevent uh open source                                 software                                 uh from being used for for evil                                 um now then as                                 now uh such licenses were deemed                                 incompatible with the open source                                 definitions rule number six                                 uh which prohibits discrimination                                 against fields of endeavor                                 in this case we're talking about the                                 ancient endeavor of war                                 now unsurprisingly uh                                 those who have been defending the open                                 source definition                                 for the last two decades dismiss                                 recent efforts as merely history                                 repeating itself                                 so this is a quote from bruce perrin's                                 bruce perrins                                 for those of you who are unaware is the                                 author                                 of the open source definition before                                 that he was the author                                 of the debian free software guidelines                                 which are                                 the guidelines that gave rise to the                                 open source definition and on which the                                 open source definition was                                 very closely based so bruce was the                                 debian project leader back in the                                 mid                                                     uh came up with the debbie and free                                 software guides as a sort of statement                                 of principles to                                 say what what was uh appropriate for                                 inclusion                                 in uh debian uh                                 the debian distribution and what was                                 inappropriate                                 um and so then he went off and formed                                 the open source initiative                                 uh as a way of sort of evangelizing the                                 concept of open source in a more                                 business-friendly context uh and adapted                                 the debian free software guidelines to                                 be the open source definition                                 um that was the basis for uh the open                                 source initiatives                                 determinations of which licenses were                                 open source or not                                 so uh what he said about the recent                                 movement toward                                 more ethical licenses is this                                 uh more recently there's been a spate of                                 ethical licenses which require specific                                 conduct of the software user                                 although although there has been a                                 regular stream of such things suggested                                 to the open source initiative over the                                 past                                          the most recent crop includes the                                 anti-                                            which requires the licensee not commit                                 labor abuses which are said to be                                 rampant in china                                 the vaccine license which requires users                                 to get their shots                                 and the hippocratic license which                                 prohibits use                                 abuses against uh underprivileged                                 minorities                                 uh and so he made these comments in a                                 in a blog post and goes on to say                                 essentially                                 we've seen all of this before we've had                                 developers try to put ethical use                                 clauses into open source licenses before                                 and we've known for a long time that                                 these clauses violate the open source                                 definition and shouldn't be included in                                 open source licenses                                 because uh well that's what we decided                                 and it's bad for open source                                 and uh it makes it more difficult to                                 sort of establish                                 the commons of software for common use                                 that                                 we were trying to when we set up the                                 concept of of open source                                 in the first place so no surprise that                                 those who have been around since the                                 early days of open source and helped                                 shape what the open source definition                                 is are resistant to                                 recent efforts to uh to sort of                                 push on the definition of open source                                 whether it's from the ethical source                                 side or from the sort of business                                 friendly                                 license side                                 now likewise                                 just with just as with ethical source                                 licenses licenses that                                 limit competition in one way or another                                 have also been around as long                                 as open source has been around um so to                                 give a couple of examples                                 um the sun community source license                                 which was previously applied to java                                 back before it was made open source                                 in certain respects under the gpl v                                  with the glass path exception the sun                                 community source license gave open                                 source like permissions                                 but required modified versions for                                 example of java                                 to remain compatible with sun's                                 specifications                                 so they were preventing essentially a                                 competing or fractured java ecosystem                                 with that license                                 again not considered open source at the                                 time though shared a lot in common with                                 open source and borrowed a lot from from                                 open source licenses                                 uh and then there was microsoft's shared                                 source initiative which received a                                 whole lot of negative attention from the                                 open source community back                                 uh in the day so this was around                                      when it was introduced                                 um and that initiative permitted a range                                 of activities                                 uh depending on the nature of the                                 licensee's use                                 um so depending on whether it was                                 academic or non-profit etc                                 and how likely that use was to compete                                 with microsoft's business                                 so the concept of                                 uh you know using an open source like                                 license                                 to restrict uh competition um                                 or sort of other businesses from getting                                 too close to the core business of the                                 licensor                                 uh is is something that's been around                                 since                                 open source has been around um                                 and uh so                                 these licenses are um considered like                                 ethical source licenses to violate open                                 source rule number                                 six because they discriminate against                                 certain commercial uses of the software                                 which                                 are fields of endeavor like business or                                 like war or like genetic research                                 um so uh                                 this includes recent efforts um such as                                 the commons clause                                 uh which plainly prohibits selling the                                 license software                                 um and the elastic license which is                                 which is excerpted here                                 which prohibits providing managed                                 services                                 around software so the elastic license                                 specifically says                                 you may not provide the software to                                 third parties as a hosted or managed                                 service                                 where the service provides users with                                 access to any substantial set                                 of the features or functionality of the                                 software                                 and so in in theory the idea behind this                                 particular license                                 is to address you know what's commonly                                 reported as a problem                                 among uh software vendors that                                 uh produce software for sort of cloud                                 services                                 um that you know large uh cloud platform                                 providers like amazon can come along                                 you know use their immense resources to                                 offer their                                 uh to offer these open source services                                 in this case for example                                 elasticsearch or cabana uh as a service                                 um and and effectively undercut                                 one of the potential business models for                                 a company that wants to                                 make it software open source but also                                 develop a business model around the                                 software                                 so in this case um you know the licensor                                 wanted to                                 offer managed services itself but feels                                 that it's diffic too difficult to                                 compete with                                 someone like amazon who offers managed                                 services at such                                 an immense scale that that a startup uh                                 has a difficult time                                 competing with them um                                 now the licenses like this                                 are uh quite clearly uh                                 in violation of the open source                                 definition at least as it's been                                 sort of classically interpreted that if                                 you're if you're excluding a particular                                 type of use of the software uh in a                                 relatively clear way then you are                                 discriminating against a field of                                 endeavor um so there's really no                                 there's there's never been any argument                                 including from the people who develop                                 these licenses that the commons clause                                 or the elastic license are open source                                 licenses they are meant to be                                 open source like licenses that give you                                 a lot of the same flexibility to sort of                                 adopt                                 adopt the software uh for your own                                 business needs so long as you're not                                 competing                                 um but uh but not to give you                                 um all of the freedoms that an open                                 source software license                                 uh would give you um now                                 they succeed or fail you know sort of to                                 questionable and                                 in varying degrees uh along you know                                 along um their stated purpose which is                                 to                                 permit everything except for competing                                 with uh with the original licensor                                 um some of some of these licenses i've                                 found                                 difficult to uh to interpret on behalf                                 of my clients who                                 really aren't anywhere like an amazon                                 but                                 the terms of the license are often quite                                 quite vague                                 uh you know intentionally and so it's                                 you know there's there's a broader set                                 of things where you where you need to go                                 back to the original license or to ask                                 about if you                                 if you're serious about using their                                 software in a more sort of open source                                 way um but                                 whereas uh whereas licenses like the                                 commons clause or the elastic license                                 are um sort of obviously and                                 intentionally not conformant to the open                                 source definition others have been a                                 closer call                                 so mongodb developed its server-side                                 public license                                 um with the help of an experienced open                                 source attorney                                 and with the goal of it being an open                                 source compliant open source definition                                 compliant                                 open source license um so they based the                                 license on                                 uh the afero gpl version three um                                 and and you know very intentionally i                                 think only changed a single                                 a single section of that license which                                 is the section on                                 you know interaction with other network                                 services                                 uh section                                         rather than competing sorry rather than                                 prohibiting                                 competing or commercial uses in the same                                 way that the                                 commons clause or the elastic license do                                 it took the same basic approach as                                 strong copy left licenses like the                                 agpl on which it was based so to require                                 the licensees of the software to make                                 enough of their own software open source                                 that they can't lock down competitive                                 modifications and therefore                                 you know it basically makes it a lot                                 harder for someone else to compete with                                 you but it does it by saying                                 you know by by essentially having a                                 reciprocity or share alike or copy left                                 requirement                                 now uh that copyleft requirement goes                                 much further than uh the gpl's copyleft                                 requirement and that's really been the                                 source of the controversy for the                                 server-side public license                                 in addition to sort of para osd                                 concerns the server-side public license                                 really didn't fare well                                 in the open source initiatives license                                 review process                                 um but many of the criticisms were                                 rooted sort of only                                 loosely in the open source definition                                 many commentators were clearly                                 suspicious of mongodb's motives and                                 accused them of using the open source                                 initiative to rubber                                 stamp a sort of bait and switch                                 licensing strategy                                 rather than sort of in good faith                                 putting forward an open source license                                 for                                 others to use um so                                 i think the most cogent open source                                 definition based                                 argument uh related to the                                 um                                 related to the server-side public                                 license was that it                                 it violated rule number nine of the open                                 source definition which is                                 that the license must not restrict other                                 software                                 and i apologize i think i got a little                                 lazy with my slides here and so i don't                                 have rule number nine up but                                 rule number nine of the open source                                 definition provides that a license may                                 not restrict other software                                 um with which it's distributed we looked                                 at it a little earlier                                 um and that's because the server-side                                 public license requires                                 licensees to open source software that                                 wasn't based on                                 the license software itself so that                                 would include                                 management software uh user interfaces                                 application program interfaces                                 automation software                                 monitoring software backup software                                 storage software and hosting software                                 uh the idea being basically if you're                                 amazon and you want to                                 offer uh mongodb as a service then you                                 have to open source                                 everything that makes it possible for                                 you to deliver that service to your                                 customers                                 at scale and therefore to eliminate                                 whatever                                 competitive advantage that you have at                                 least based on sort of                                 you know what you've built in that                                 superstructure around the software                                 over over the developers of mongodb                                 which is to say                                 mongodb now                                 this argument itself that that                                 this provision of the server-side public                                 license violated                                 um the open source definition has its                                 own problems it's not as clear-cut                                 as the argument against ethical uh                                 ethical source licenses um you know and                                 the first reason for this                                 is that as bruce parents himself                                 recognized on the open source                                 initiative license review list uh                                 the uh the argument doesn't really line                                 up all that well                                 with rule number nine of the open source                                 definition                                 um so that definition says that the                                 license may not                                 place restrictions on other software                                 that is distributed along with the                                 license software                                 for example the license must not insist                                 that all other programs distributed on                                 the same medium must be open source                                 but as he goes on to say since software                                 as a service is not distributed                                 open source definition number rule                                 number nine doesn't                                 apply um by its literal terms to use                                 like                                 uh mongodbs and the server-side public                                 license                                 sorry he says the document was written                                 for another time and i couldn't predict                                 today's conditions                                 he goes on in a later message to say                                 that he didn't even have a lawyer to                                 help him                                 um and so uh                                 and so here again we see that you know                                 there is this sort of                                 common community understanding that that                                 uh                                 came out on the osi mailing list about                                 this license                                 that was in violation of of rule nine or                                 that at least                                 it in some way violated the open source                                 definition                                 um but uh but it's actually a little bit                                 of a poor fit in part because the open                                 source definitions                                 uh language has you know is is so                                 limited to the context                                 of distribution but there's another                                 reason why                                 this argument is a little bit of a poor                                 fit against the server-side public                                 license                                 being an open source license and that's                                 that                                 historically the open source initiative                                 hasn't held the clearest line when it                                 comes to applying                                 rule nine at least in my opinion so for                                 example uh                                 gpl version two has long required                                 licensees to provide not only the source                                 code for the software                                 itself that's licensed under the under                                 the license                                 but also the scripts used to control                                 compilation and installation of the                                 executable now as in the case of the                                 laundry list of things that                                 the sspl requires you to provide um                                 scripts used to control compilation and                                 installation of the executable are not                                 actually the software itself                                 they're not a derivative work of the                                 software they are software that is                                 used to sort of um deploy the software                                 to sort of put it into practical effect                                 in in the specific context where you're                                 using it                                 so you know the osi has in the past                                 approved licenses that sort of reach                                 beyond the software itself                                 to um to other things that that help you                                 to                                 deploy it in a particular instance and                                 it's not really clear where the line is                                 between what gpl                                 v                                                                       a little further to these scripts and                                 maybe scripts are considered sort of                                 less                                 uh substantial than than the types of                                 things that the sspl was trying to                                 require                                 but again the line is just not that                                 clear and likewise gplv                                  required that you know in addition to                                 all of                                 the things that gplb                                              the software that comes in embedded                                 devices uh or                                 consumer electronics devices um include                                 any installation information required to                                 install modified versions of the                                 software back into the device and so                                 again you could you could read that as a                                 restriction on a field of endeavor                                 as in the delivery of sort of locked                                 down                                 consumer electronics devices you could                                 read it as a restriction on the other                                 software on the device including the                                 software that controls                                 access to the device's internal software                                 and memory                                 um but uh both versions of the gpl                                 have of course long been considered                                 compliant with the open source                                 definition                                 whereas the sspl which sort of like                                 stretches these same types of                                 requirements                                 was pretty roundly rejected                                 and all of this is just to say that um                                 you know which i think is the obvious                                 that the open source application open                                 source initiatives application of the                                 open source definition is uh to                                 particular licenses is necessarily                                 political process                                 as in court where there's ambiguity in                                 the constitution and the law                                 the political bias of the judges or just                                 the people on the open source initiative                                 mailing list can determine the outcome                                 and this isn't an inherently bad or                                 wrong thing it's a trade-off between                                 certainty and adaptability                                 in the open source definition and our                                 systems of law make the same trade-offs                                 um open source initiatives license                                 review committee is basically a                                 conservative institution applying                                 established rules                                 periodically to new cases and                                 intentionally avoiding innovation                                 and as in a constitutional democracy                                 fundamental changes are supposed to be                                 really difficult to make                                 and they happen slowly and so when they                                 do occur it's typically the result of                                 social change that sort of builds slowly                                 or almost                                 imperceptibly over time until suddenly                                 the need for change is undeniable                                 and those changes can sneak up on you                                 and i you know again i'm                                 i'm going to apologize for giving a very                                 u.s centered                                 metaphor here but in the u.s the first                                 cage                                 the first court case challenging laws                                 prohibiting gay marriage                                 uh was brought in                                         as late as                                                       president signed a federal law                                 defending traditional marriage by                                 defining it as                                 between one man and one woman in                                      two states approved state constitutional                                 amendments making gay marriage                                 unconstitutional                                 so in the late                                                         sort of                                 wall against this concept that gay                                 marriage is something that                                 that that the state should permit                                 and then in                                                           the first state to explicitly permit gay                                 marriage                                 and then nearly half of the states in                                 the u.s                                 followed over the course of just the                                 next decade so from                                 you know                                              no action and then from                                              suddenly half the country is on board                                 with this                                 um and in                                                            ruled gay marriage                                 bans unconstitutional nationwide and i                                 don't mean to say that acceptance of                                 ethical source licenses                                 much less business source licenses are                                 as important as the legalization of gay                                 marriage in the united states                                 or even that they're inevitable only                                 that the recurrence of an idea                                 over the course of time doesn't                                 necessarily mean that it's tired or worn                                 out or wrong                                 sometimes it only means that it's                                 building steam                                 and while the triumph of gay marriage is                                 perhaps a less compelling metaphor for                                 the struggle of adoption of business                                 friendly licenses in particular                                 the struggle of those licenses may be                                 bound up inextricably with the evolution                                 of copyleft licenses more generally                                 it was the progressive wing of our                                 movement richard stallman's free                                 software foundation that raised the                                 alarm about the                                 sort of application service provider                                 loophole to begin with                                 that banner that's now being taken up by                                 companies like mongodb                                 and elastic from a very different                                 perspective instead of incentives                                 um but the solution to that problem the                                 affair of gpl                                 never really had the impact on server                                 side software that the gpl did on the                                 previous paradigm                                 and its model of software deployment may                                 be as outdated                                 now as the gpl v                                                        affair gpl was adopted                                 as the pace of technology technological                                 development continues to increase                                 so while it's understandable that the                                 osi would see a license like the sspl                                 as a cynical attempt to co-opt open                                 source for business advantage                                 it'll eventually have to reckon i think                                 with a competent next-generation                                 copyleft license                                 genuinely aimed at increasing software                                 freedom                                 or human freedom and that license may                                 look a lot more like the sspl                                 than it does like the agpl and if                                 licenses                                 are going to remain an effective tool                                 for enforcing community values and                                 bringing software freedom                                 in this new age of distributed online                                 network services                                 than something is going to have to give                                 thank you that's my presentation                                 i understand that maybe i'll be thrown                                 into a room for                                 questions now hi thank you so much aaron                                 yes uh so many interesting topics and                                 i have some questions myself but i would                                 like first to encourage you to post your                                 questions                                 in the chat in prinzlowerberg in                                 streamyard or sorry in venulis                                 any questions you can either post them                                 as a chat directly or                                 in the questions tab which is next to                                 the the chat top right                                 in the meantime i will ask you a                                 question aaron because i don't see any                                 questions                                 there just yet uh so you said that the                                 agpl                                  may be outdated for the needs of uh                                 recent companies and market activity                                 i think that's a fascinating concept and                                 so                                 does that mean that you do see merit and                                 justification in                                 some of these additional restrictions on                                 on freedom that you described from                                 mongodb in elastic do you                                 do you see that they i mean you                                 fundamentally agree with those companies                                 that restricting                                 the freedoms that we're used to could be                                 necessary to preserve                                 freedom in the current commercial                                 context                                 well um i i'm going to reserve judgment                                 on that exact                                 question um but what what i you know                                 there's there's                                 always been this tension in in free and                                 open source like                                 software licensing between you know                                 restriction and                                 and freedom right and different concepts                                 of freedom so you know if you are                                 if you are sort of more uh on the                                 i if you're if you're more concerned                                 with the freedom of developers                                 then you might lean more toward uh                                 highly permissive open source licenses                                 because in in one sense those grant                                 more freedoms than a copyleft license                                 whereas                                 if you are concerned with ensuring your                                 software is never used to restrict                                 another person's freedom                                 then you may lean more toward a copy                                 left license and so my point isn't that                                 i agree with these companies                                 and their particular restrictions it's                                 more that if you                                 if you believe that copyleft licensing                                 has a place in the sort of                                 new software paradigm then necessarily                                 it's going to get more restrictive um                                 than existing copyleft licenses in the                                 same way                                 that uh the server-side public license                                 got more restrictive and                                 and you might be able to find a more                                 clever way to do it and there are in                                 fact several                                 i think efforts to think about what the                                 future of copyleft                                 looks like in our community um                                 copyleftconf                                 um was started by the software freedom                                 conservancy to consider                                 sort of you know what the future of of                                 copyleft ought to look like                                 um i know a few people who have taken a                                 stab                                 uh at drafting sort of model                                 model copyleft licenses for for a new                                 era including                                 um richard fontana who who's at red hat                                 and a lawyer named kyle mitchell                                 um and so these are these are all                                 interesting efforts                                 um but eventually you know                                 the i think the uncomfortable truth for                                 the for copyleft proponents                                 is that uh is that                                 you know their their interests are bound                                 up                                 more with the interests of these                                 companies who they tend to be highly                                 suspicious of than                                 than maybe they think                                 interesting so you potentially see that                                 freedoms will necessarily be more                                 restricted in future then                                 um i i think it will be one strategy um                                 for                                 for software freedom proponents uh for                                 for attempting to sort of secure the                                 freedoms of                                 of uh free and open source software                                 licenses                                 in in the cloud environment thank you                                 and we have a question from uh                                 jan vildeboa who some of us will be                                  familiar with about the                                  interpretation of the sspl by                                  distributions                                  uh he says that red hat made the                                  decision that it was not compatible                                  for them to distribute software under                                  that license                                  and he asks about uh whether other                                  distributions                                  necessarily need to take the same                                  approach do you have an opinion on this                                  about the compatibility of sspl with                                  distribution models                                  through software repositories and by                                  existing open source linux distributions                                  uh i mean what i would say about that is                                  you know it sort of goes back to the                                  point i made at the beginning of this                                  uh of this talk which is there are two                                  ways to think about                                  uh what the open source uh what an open                                  source license is                                  one is uh that it is a license that                                  conforms the open source definition                                  in which case you can make your own                                  determination about whether                                  a particular license complies regardless                                  of whether the open source initiative                                  has weighed in                                  on it and one is that it's an open                                  source license that has been                                  uh approved by the osi as conformant                                  with the open source definition now                                  the open source initiative took the uh                                  took the i think                                  unusual step um in response to the                                  server-side public license of                                  publishing a blog post signed by the                                  open source initiatives board saying                                  um even though it was withdrawn from the                                  license review process                                  that the server-side public license was                                  not an open source                                  license now notably i don't think they                                  really gave                                  much of a justification under the under                                  the                                  sort of specific terms of the open                                  source definition for why that is                                  um certainly the licensed stewards uh                                  mongodb                                  continued to you know assert that it was                                  a valid open source license even                                  after it was withdrawn um just sort of                                  saw the writing on the wall                                  um so i think certainly you know                                  distributions can make their own                                  decisions                                  um about this but they they they face                                  their own                                  uh sort of internal processes internal                                  politics around                                  around you know what ought to be                                  considered an open source                                  license and so you know i think                                  it probably will be an uphill battle um                                  but                                  but of course you know anybody's allowed                                  to interpret the open source definition                                  as they please and ultimately it's going                                  to be the downstream users who have to                                  decide whether                                  whether it's an appropriate license for                                  their use                                  thank you very much                                  you
