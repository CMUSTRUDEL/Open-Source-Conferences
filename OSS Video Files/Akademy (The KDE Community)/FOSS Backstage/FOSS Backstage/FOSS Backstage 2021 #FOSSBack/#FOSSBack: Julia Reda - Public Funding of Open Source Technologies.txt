	                              thanks for coming you again                               thank you yeah it's a great pleasure to                               be here and                               uh to speak on this important subject                               you've already                               said i think the most important                               biographical facts about myself                               uh i would just like to add for                               transparency's sake that i am                                nowadays also a board member of the                                open knowledge foundation germany which                                is also working on this subject of                                funding                                uh open source technology um so today                                however i am representing myself as a                                private person who is passionate about                                free software and already when i was a                                member of the european parliament i was                                trying to convince                                governments to take um free and open                                source software more seriously                                as a matter of public policy and uh                                today                                i want to give you an update on my                                thinking on this and also some of the                                work that i've been doing with other                                free software policy activists in order                                to                                make more public funding for open source                                technology a reality                                in europe so i want to start with a                                pretty                                i would say high level of observation                                about                                what government actually is and what                                what its purpose is so like on a very                                idealized                                uh very high level view the government                                is                                supposed to be all of us so it's                                representing                                the entire population and trying to                                serve all of the population and be                                accountable to it                                and one very important function that                                government                                provides for its population is to                                uh provide to build and to maintain                                infrastructure                                and in the past this was mostly                                sort of thought of as uh maintaining                                roads or making sure that there is a                                fire service and                                other public services like that but i                                think                                more and more software has become                                such an infrastructure for public life                                and we are seeing this really more than                                ever                                during the coronavirus pandemic i mean i                                was looking at this slide                                that i have used before and it very much                                looks like                                a scene from a different world uh now                                that we're in lockdown and our                                daily lives all parts of it education                                etc have really become more and more                                mediated                                by technology and i think that                                the government should therefore have a                                free software philosophy                                at its heart which is to use free                                software                                to take responsibility for it and also                                to contribute to the development of                                free and open source software because it                                really forms part of the backbone                                of public service that governments are                                responsible for                                um it's quite quite certain i think                                also that nowadays in this very                                technologically mediated society those                                who build the technology have a lot of                                power                                and this phrase algorithms rule the                                world                                is maybe a little bit cheeky in the                                sense that                                it sounds sort of like some of these                                really                                um sensational headlines that are trying                                to pretend that software is magic                                and this is not what i'm trying to say                                with this so i'm not saying you know                                algorithms are are scary and therefore                                we should ban them or anything like that                                which is popular with some politicians                                but rather in the sense that computers                                are no longer                                 limited to particular parts of our lives                                 but instead                                 all of our society is mediated by                                 technology and                                 this is leading sometimes to some really                                 fun                                 and weird problems like uh you know                                 this twitter account internet of is                                 uh                                 um collecting sort of funny                                 problems funny bugs with uh the internet                                 of things where you could have                                 uh a blue screen of death on a fridge                                 which is maybe not like the greatest                                 uh utopian scenario so                                 um nowadays of course with the                                 coronavirus this has become                                 even more obvious because                                 all of a sudden we had to improvise                                 digital solutions for a lot of things                                 that we used to do physically                                 and at the center of the discussion has                                 sort of been zoom                                 and whether it's a good idea that                                 everybody is using this proprietary                                 software                                 um but because it was a crisis                                 uh when the first lockdown started a                                 year ago                                 the sort of normative power of                                 having something that works out of the                                 box                                 sort of took over but um i think                                 one year into the crisis we should no                                 longer                                 take this uh excuse that we were in a                                 crisis situation and instead really                                 ask our governments to also help                                 support and provide open source                                 alternatives that have the same sort of                                 backbone                                 power that a proprietary software like                                 zoom can provide and also the same                                 usability which also is you know needs                                 to be developed needs to be tested and                                 can be quite expensive                                 and everybody benefits from it being                                 there but                                 not everybody feels responsible to                                 contribute to it and to pay for it                                 the same is true in other parts of                                 society like schools                                 businesses and even the public                                 administrations themselves like                                 i come from germany and german public                                 administration has been very reluctant                                 to digitizing a lot of its services for                                 a long time                                 but now that a lot of public services                                 had to close their physical spaces it's                                 really                                 become so urgent that they have to                                 seriously deal with these questions                                 so quite often we end up using                                 improvised proprietary solutions that                                 actually conflict                                 with our own data security and data                                 protection standards                                 so i think we've established                                 at this point that software is playing                                 this increasingly important role in our                                 society                                 and then the question is okay what                                 should be the government's role in it                                 um i think it would be somewhat                                 dangerous if government was centrally                                 controlling                                 open source software projects because of                                 course um                                 the permissionless innovation and the                                 the possibility that really everybody                                 can participate uh                                 in free software projects um without                                 some sort of central                                 control and planning is really what has                                 made free software so successful so i                                 think it's really more about                                 creating the awareness                                 within governments that they are already                                 relying on free and open source software                                 every day whether they are aware of it                                 or not                                 because quite often politicians                                 understanding of software is very much                                 focused on the application layer only                                 and they don't know all the software                                 libraries or the server infrastructure                                 that is run on open source                                 even in their own institutions so my                                 goal is that                                 uh governments realize this better and                                 start taking more responsibility                                 to actually support the security and                                 safety of their own it infrastructures                                 but by that also start contributing more                                 to the overall software ecosystem                                 there is a very i think somewhat                                 dangerous debate going on                                 at the moment in europe about digital                                 sovereignty                                 that is sort of trying to frame the                                 dependence on proprietary software as a                                 nationalist                                 issue and i don't really like this                                 framing because for me                                 the point is not that you know amazon or                                 microsoft are                                 american companies but i think the                                 problem is really more                                 that um if the uh                                 open source software that we are using                                 on a day-to-day basis                                 is not accessible to a security audits                                 and to modification that actually suits                                 our needs                                 so i think we should not promote this                                 idea of digital sovereignty as sort of                                 trying to                                 separate the internet and digital                                 technology into different geopolitical                                 spheres                                 actually that is an idea that china                                 and russia have been promoting in the                                 past                                 at for example international internet                                 governance discussions that basically                                 the internet should not be a global                                 medium                                 i think we should actually take this                                 discussion around digital sovereignty in                                 a different direction                                 so the kind of digital sovereignty that                                 makes sense to me                                 is to say okay if we have a lot of free                                 and open source software                                 that provides the basic infrastructure                                 that a state needs to function and that                                 the economy                                 and the educational system needs to                                 function then                                 we become less dependent on a single                                 government                                 or on a single company regardless of                                 which country that company is from or                                 whether it's a multinational                                 so digital sovereignty can actually be                                 interconnectedness and decentralization                                 instead of trying to                                 sort of lock ourselves up off from the                                 rest of the world                                 i don't really care if software is made                                 in germany                                 as long as it is made open source and so                                 i think                                 it's important to kind of instill this                                 thinking also in public administrations                                 to sort of go away from only funding                                 companies that sort of immediately and                                 directly contribute to the economic                                 growth of                                 that particular country and instead also                                 look at                                 what is the basis for all of that                                 economic growth                                 what is the free infrastructure that at                                 the end of the day benefits                                 all of us because i don't think that                                 global politics                                 is a zero-sum game where we can only                                 benefit if somebody else is losing out                                 so um i think this idea of sort of                                 digital sovereignty as                                 embodying decentralization connectedness                                 and                                 permissionless innovation is actually                                 pretty well                                 um established in one already existing                                 u.s based                                 uh open source funding program the open                                 technology fund                                 so uh this is a pretty good program that                                 uh                                 we all benefit from even though it's                                 paid for by the u.s government                                 but it is not run by the us government                                 it's run by                                 an independent ngo that has been                                 receiving                                 public funding from congress in order to                                 promote primarily anti-censorship                                 technology so they have funded things                                 like signal                                 or tor or wireguard so also privacy                                 technologies that help                                 democracy activists independent                                 journalists around the world                                 um in countries such as belarus or hong                                 kong or iran                                 to stand up to authoritarian governments                                 and so of course                                 this has been sort of in the interest of                                 the us government as well                                 but nobody is stopping the                                 you know activists in other countries                                 that may not be aligned with u.s policy                                 from using those open source                                 technologies precisely because they are                                 open source and so i'm sure that a lot                                 of the developers who have                                 received public funding from the open                                 technology fund do not agree with the                                 us government's policies at all i mean                                 uh just look at sort of the surveillance                                 programs at the                                 of the us but because there is a                                 separation between it where                                 money is coming from the public sector                                 but the organization of the funding is                                 done by civil society                                 this is why people can trust these kinds                                 of projects and so i think it's a good                                 model                                 that we should learn from so                                 the problem though that was exposed with                                 the open technology fund is that last                                 year                                 this project was under extreme threat                                 because                                 there was a single point of failure                                 because basically if you only have this                                 one project                                 that lots and lots of open source                                 technology projects rely on this one                                 funding source                                 then a single authoritarian regime can                                 also try to shut it down and this was                                 actually something that was attempted                                 by the trump administration last year so                                 president trump appointed one of his                                 allies to the u.s                                 agency for global media who                                 fired executives from the open                                 technology fund                                 froze its funding and also even tried to                                 get the otf                                 permanently banned from receiving u.s                                 funding even after                                 uh he would leave office now unfortunate                                 uh let's say                                 fortunately this attack on the open                                 technology fund was                                 not successful because they actually had                                 support                                 from both parties in congress and were                                 able to                                 um protect it from um                                 from this attack and now under the biden                                 administration it's pretty clear                                 that the open technology fund will be                                 able to continue                                 but i think what this means for us                                 european is that                                 we are not very digitally sovereign if                                 uh basically a single government                                 somewhere else in the world can                                 go down an authoritarian route and                                 suddenly                                 the free software that we all have been                                 relying on for our privacy                                 for circumventing censorship                                 technologies is suddenly                                 not funded anymore so in a way i feel                                 like the eu                                 has been coasting on the benefits of the                                 open technology fund without                                 actually contributing to it and i think                                 this is something that should change                                 because um if there are more prop                                 uh projects like the open technology                                 fund that maybe                                 focus on different types of open source                                 technologies                                 not just on sort of privacy technologies                                 in particular                                 um then it's also less damaging if a                                 single one of them loses its funding or                                 has to                                 reduce its operation for a particular                                 time because i think                                 one thing that is really important and                                 that has not been                                 paid attention to enough is the                                 maintenance of free and open source                                 software projects                                 which is not as sexy as saying okay i'm                                 inventing something entirely new                                 but the maintenance is just as important                                 so where are we in the european union                                 there are some funding infrastructures                                 in                                 individual member states such as the                                 netherlands and                                 also to a certain extent at the european                                 union level and i'm mostly going to talk                                 about the eu                                 because i was involved with that and                                 also with                                 germany because this is the country                                 where i'm from but there are                                 also other um very interesting and                                 exciting projects in                                 other member states that i think we                                 should share information about                                 so the european commission is really                                 uncomfortable                                 with its own reliance on proprietary                                 technology so for example when the                                 the lockdown started um the european                                 commission was criticizing                                 the security of zoom but at the same                                 time                                 still using it for some of its own                                 meetings                                 well because it simply worked so i think                                 we need to push the european commission                                 to actually put its money where its                                 mouth                                 is and it already has an open source                                 strategy so that's good                                 it has committed to releasing um                                 more of its in-house software as open                                 source and i think that's a really good                                 development                                 but we should sort of push them                                 to also fund open source projects more                                 generally                                 so um when i was in the european                                 parliament                                 in                                                                       parliament                                 the heartbleed and shellshook                                 vulnerabilities were                                 discovered and they i think demonstrated                                 that                                 open source software and open source                                 infrastructure is really                                 implemented all over the place and quite                                 often we're not aware                                 aware of it and even though                                 free and open source software has a lot                                 of                                 benefits in terms of security and                                 reliability                                 it's not enough to just make something                                 open source                                 you also have to make sure that there is                                 funding available and an infrastructure                                 available to make sure that the software                                 can be maintained and audited                                 so as sort of a learning                                 from heartbleed i was able to convince                                 the european commission with a few of my                                 colleagues                                 to start the free and open source                                 software auditing project                                 where the goal was basically to pay for                                 the audit                                 of free software applications that were                                 used inside the european commission                                 and then to release those the results of                                 those audits                                 and hopefully bug fixes back into those                                 projects                                 and um well i think we learned a lot in                                 the                                 process of doing this pilot project                                 because the european commission had                                 never done something like this before                                 and we ran into quite a lot of problems                                 and then sort of try to                                 iterately iteratively improve                                 this project so in the beginning um                                 there was basically the approach of                                 contracting this                                 security audit out to a company so there                                 was a public tender                                 and we realized that basically the the                                 companies or the individuals that are                                 best placed to actually                                 improve free and open source software                                 are not usually the companies that are                                 best placed to win                                 european union public tenders because                                 this is just a different                                 sort of skill sets there is a lot of                                 bureaucracy involved                                 and there is a high risk that you end up                                 with a consultancy that produces a lot                                 of reports writes a lot of things                                 but doesn't actually write a lot of code                                 and so                                 um in order to fix this problem we                                 eventually changed the eu fossa program                                 into a bug bounty program                                 which was also criticized by some people                                 because back bounties um                                 can also create sort of um not ideal                                 incentives because back bounties                                 basically are paid out for finding a bug                                 but then there is still the problem who                                 is doing the actual work of fixing the                                 bug                                 and um even though the eu fossa has                                 finished by now and it has                                 i think found some quite serious flaws                                 for example in putti                                 that were fixed as a consequence of it                                 and                                 generally the response from the free                                 software community to fossa was quite                                 good                                 this project has now wrapped up and is                                 being continued in a slightly different                                 form as part of                                 the europeans commission's isa square                                 program                                 so in isa square the european commission                                 is actually trying to                                 pay for the fixing of bugs which i think                                 is a good sort of next step approach so                                 they have                                 partnered up with integrity and um                                 are basically paying a                                          for uh bug bounties that um                                 are released in the contracts context of                                 the matrix.org                                 program program for encrypted and                                 decentralized communication so if you                                 don't just find the vulnerability but                                 also provide a fix                                 you get this                                                      actually a program that is running right                                 now and that people can participate in                                 um                                 at the year at german level we have the                                 prototype fund which is                                 also funded by uh german government                                 ministry                                 but is uh run by civil society and i                                 think this is really the best approach                                 to make sure that free software                                 developers have an                                 easy time actually applying for funding                                 so the prototype fund                                 is also a project of the open knowledge                                 foundation                                 where i'm a board member and it's                                 directly funding free software                                 um and also helps projects with the                                 bureaucracy                                 around that so the problem though                                 is that because of the limits that are                                 put on the funding by the german                                 government the prototype fund can only                                 fund prototypes so it's about funding                                 innovation it's about starting off a new                                 project which can be pretty important                                 but what is missing is a funding                                 structure for the maintenance of open                                 source infrastructure                                 i really like this xkcd pro comic                                 because i think it illustrates                                 the problem very well so um it's kind of                                 a stack of                                 building bricks that says all modern                                 digital infrastructure                                 and then at the very bottom there's a                                 tiny piece that says                                 a project some random person in nebraska                                 has been thanklessly maintaining since                                                                      now this person in nebraska would not be                                 able to apply                                 to a lot of the existing funding pro                                 programs for                                 open source software because it's not                                 innovative it's not you know developing                                 a prototype it's                                 sort of boring it's maintaining                                 something that everybody relies on but                                 most politicians have never heard of                                 and this is i think the funding                                 structure that is missing and that we                                 should                                 have in the european union so um                                 together with some activist friends from                                 different organizations both from the                                 prototype fund but also from the open                                 technology fund                                 i've started sort of conceptualizing                                 what such a digital infrastructure                                 fund could look like and also trying to                                 start to talk to                                 government officials in the german                                 government and also in the european                                 commission about how we can make this a                                 reality                                 so we have come up with a few principles                                 that                                 would be really important for this fund                                 to work                                 first of all um we should learn                                 from the lessons of the fossa program                                 and the prototype funds so                                 it must be really easy to apply to this                                 was not the case in the beginning of                                 fossa                                 it sort of became better throughout the                                 bug bounty process                                 but it's also something that the                                 prototype fund is really good at that                                 the entry barrier is low                                 and even if you're not a company even if                                 you're like an individual person                                 you should be able to apply for funding                                 for your free software project                                 um there has to be very low overheads so                                 you should not                                 basically have reports written by                                 consultancies and things like this but                                 the majority of the funding should go                                 directly                                 to the project it must not be limited to                                 innovative projects so we have to                                 convince                                 governments that it's worth funding the                                 maintenance and improvement of                                 infrastructure rather than just funding                                 innovation because at the end of the day                                 new innovation is going to build on top                                 of that and so it is going to pay off                                 for the economy at large but we have to                                 focus on sustainability and making sure                                 that basically if this one building                                 block in the xkcd comic is pulled out                                 that the whole infrastructure doesn't                                 just crumble                                 also i think it's really important that                                 this funding program has to be part of a                                 broader                                 free software and also free hardware                                 strategy                                 of government where they also pay                                 attention to other issues that arrive                                 such as                                 chip manufacturing and other issues that                                 may affect                                 our ability to sort of be digitally                                 sovereign to                                 to stay in their own vernacular                                 we also want to learn from the open                                 technology fund and                                 we're in talks with them and the great                                 thing about                                 the open technology fund is that it                                 actually wants to be copied                                 the entire basically operational                                 infrastructure of                                 how the otf distributes funding is open                                 source itself                                 so we are able to to basically                                 take all the lessons that they have                                 learned in their operation                                 and build a european project that is                                 inspired by it but maybe is funding                                 slightly                                 different projects so from the otf i                                 think we have learned how important it                                 is that                                 this funding structure must not be                                 directly run by the government                                 it's okay if money is coming from the                                 public hand i think that's the job of                                 the public administration                                 but at the same time i think a lot of                                 developers are rightfully suspicious of                                 government oversight and so that should                                 not be                                 part of this funding structure also                                 there should be no expectation                                 of promoting the government in exchange                                 for receiving this funding you're                                 receiving the funding because this is                                 something                                 that is helpful to society at large and                                 not because the government wants to have                                 a good publicity it must be built also                                 on a network of trusted actors so the                                 open source community is not just sort                                 of                                 a business community or something like                                 that it's a culture where people know                                 each other and trust                                 individual people that they have worked                                 with over years                                 and so whoever runs such a fund has to                                 be part of the free software community                                 to actually have                                 these personal connections and be able                                 to build this trust                                 there should also be no restrictions on                                 the nationality                                 of the people who can apply and this is                                 something that's actually pretty                                 difficult to convince governments of                                 that you know the german economy will                                 grow                                 if we give money to some developer in                                 brazil                                 who is maintaining and improving                                 infrastructure                                 that is open source i think to me this                                 is totally logical                                 but to a lot of governments it's not um                                 yeah and obviously there is no                                 competition between the open technology                                 fund which is now thankfully continuing                                 under the biden administration and these                                 this new                                 european fund that we're hoping to build                                 because basically                                 we want to have decentralized and                                 redundant funding infrastructure                                 so if one of them for example shrinks                                 the other can take it off                                 so take take it up so i think the crisis                                 with the open technology fund last year                                 has demonstrated that it's good for                                 all of us to have a diverse funding                                 infrastructure that can talk to each                                 other that can help each other                                 and that can maybe also specialize in                                 slightly different fields                                 so i think                                 uh that obviously the core                                 of the free software community are the                                 people who are building the software                                 i'm not a software developer actually                                 and i think                                 what i can contribute to the overall                                 ecosystem is to build a bridge between                                 the free software community                                 and public policy because well most                                 people in government                                 are also not free software developers so                                 i think it's great if you                                 continue to do the coding and i'll try                                 to focus on                                 telling the story behind it why this is                                 something that politicians should care                                 about                                 and um yeah i'm hoping to do that with                                 like-minded activists from                                 the other uh organizations that i've                                 mentioned such as the prototype fund the                                 open technology fund                                 and also in the individual people in the                                 european commission                                 or in governments who really want to                                 push                                 um this open source strategy forward                                 um so we will try together to make                                 something like a european digital                                 infrastructure fund or basic technology                                 fund a reality                                 in the next couple of years but what is                                 the most important                                 to us is to insist that these design                                 features that we think are needed are                                 actually                                 put in place so this means not a focus                                 on like                                 which country you're from and which tax                                 id                                 you have not a focus on                                 things like whether you're a big                                 business or an individual developer but                                 what should really count is are you                                 building something that is relevant                                 for the public infrastructure                                 and is it released as open source and is                                 it                                 auditable that is really at the core of                                 what we should be funding                                 so um the goal ultimately                                 is to have eu or global funding                                 structures                                 but we don't want to wait for you know                                                                                                to come together and to agree on                                 something with the european parliament                                 but sometimes it's actually easier                                 to start something in one country and                                 then if it's successful other countries                                 may                                 join it this has actually recently                                 happened                                 with gaia x project for open cloud                                 infrastructure which was started in                                 germany                                 and then france got interested in it and                                 now it's sort of more of a european                                 project                                 so this is kind of how we want to                                 operate so                                 um we are trying to get this off the                                 ground                                 in germany and i'm really glad to have                                 support from people within the otf who                                 are basically saying well look                                 everything we're doing is open source                                 you can copy our methodology you can                                 copy our                                 um our infrastructure our own software                                 that we're using to run this fund                                 but i think there are many important                                 areas                                 aside from anti-censorship and privacy                                 technology that also need                                 funds like the open technology fund and                                 for me sort of basic technologies that                                 are not                                 at the application layer are one of the                                 missing links that i would like to focus                                 on                                 but there are also other things i think                                 where this sort of funding                                 structure is needed so for example i                                 could imagine                                 an open technology fund for government                                 technology like government                                 applications or one for open hardware                                 and so on so i think there is no                                 shortage of areas that would benefit                                 from this                                 so hopefully in a few decades we will                                 have                                                                                           funded by different governments and                                 public sector players around the world                                 because i don't think                                 that the public infrastructure that we                                 use for everything                                 from school to work to the healthcare                                 system                                 is something that we should leave                                 entirely to the responsibility of                                 private companies so um yeah what can                                 you do to help so at the moment this                                 fund does not                                 exist yet so that means we cannot                                 actually take like                                 funding applications for this or                                 anything like this                                 but of course do check out the prototype                                 fund or the open technology fund if you                                 are building open source software that                                 you think                                 might uh fit those criteria so for the                                 otf primarily sort of anti-censorship                                 and privacy technology                                 and for the prototype fund primarily                                 sort of new ideas new projects that are                                 just starting out                                 um especially in germany and yes please                                 talk about                                 this idea write newspaper articles about                                 why                                 government should find open source                                 software and                                 um if you hear your politicians                                 talk about digital sovereignty ask them                                 what they actually mean by that like do                                 you actually mean that we should sort of                                 shut ourselves off from the rest of the                                 world i think this is something                                 that uh lies in europe's past and not in                                 its future                                 or do you actually mean that we should                                 become more resilient by having things                                 like open source                                 so we become less dependent on a single                                 technology company for example                                 and please also start similar                                 initiatives in your country                                 ask political parties to include this                                 idea in the election programs                                 and please also share if there are                                 existing projects like this in your                                 countries that we should know about                                 and yeah hopefully uh not in not too                                 distant future we will be able to share                                 good news about this project going ahead                                 in germany                                 i will leave it at that thank you very                                 much for your attention                                 um this is where you can reach me at zen                                 viking on twitter                                 or at julia.reda okay                                 and yeah i look very much forward to                                 discussing                                 more of this in breakout or by email or                                 on twitter                                 thanks a lot yeah thanks a lot julia for                                 your talk                                 um we actually got a few questions in um                                 via our platform uh maybe we can go                                 through a few before you go over to the                                 breakout and then people can take it                                 further                                 um one person asked um about the eu                                 fossa                                 project what were your what are your key                                 learnings basically from                                 this because it was the first time that                                 was done right yeah                                 um so i think the most                                 important one is that you have to make                                 it really easy to apply                                 so like the the first sort of try                                 of fossa where we had these this public                                 tender                                 i think that didn't work very well                                 because of basically                                 to yeah to win a public tender from the                                 eu you kind of                                 like you don't necessarily have to be a                                 big company but if you're an individual                                 developer                                 like yeah don't even try so at the end                                 what we                                 why we decided to do bug bounties                                 instead                                 was because then we could do a public                                 tender for                                 a bug bounty company and then basically                                 uh um different back boundary platforms                                 could apply                                 and they are actually able to do that                                 but then we were able to actually pay                                 money to individual developers which                                 otherwise the eu                                 wasn't really equipped to do but of                                 course                                 this sort of meant that we ended up                                 using                                 the form of funding because                                 this was the easiest to implement and                                 not necessarily because bug bounties are                                 the best way                                 to support the free software community                                 so in the end                                 we also did some other stuff like                                 creating hackathons which actually                                 like i was a little bit skeptical if                                 this is useful but                                 in the end actually we had some good                                 feedback because some of those                                 um communities around like relatively                                 specialized projects                                 are really global and they just never                                 meet in person because                                 it's quite expensive to fly people in                                 from all over the world so in the end                                 i'm quite happy with                                 with the fossa project even though it                                 probably didn't change the world and it                                 was also much                                 smaller than the open technology fund                                 like the open technology fund                                 it gets about                                                           so                                                                 smaller smaller than that it was more                                 like                                                                    like that                                 but still i think it's important to                                 point out that also                                                  is not a lot for the german government                                 like                                 they if they decided they wanted to do                                  that they could do it                                  right now like this is not serious money                                  for a mid-sized country                                  yeah okay then another question                                  it says funding developers has already                                  become more common                                  how do you see funding for other roles                                  like ux designers project                                  managers translators and so on that are                                  also important for                                  um fast projects yeah super important i                                  mean                                  um i think the otf is already doing a                                  little bit of that                                  like for example they have um a sort of                                  a professional training environment for                                  improving user experience for example                                  but yeah i think it's a really good                                  point that basically                                  um funding structures should be sort of                                  agnostic                                  to which part of the open source                                  development                                  the funding should go to like the                                  funding should not be reserved to the                                  coding                                  alone because things like you know user                                  interface or translation is just                                  as important for the software to be                                  actually used in practice                                  which is you know really important also                                  for the acceptance                                  of open source technology                                  then there is another question by                                  someone who sends a disclaimer that it's                                  a red hatter and says a lot                                  fast developers are employed and it                                  seems like those projects                                  seem to focus more on independent                                  developers                                  is there a way to what is the way to                                  address that                                  yeah i mean i guess if uh you're um                                  employed and you are really free to                                  basically                                  use your work time to work on any free                                  software project you want                                  that is great but i think quite commonly                                  um free software developers who are                                  employed and who are releasing the pro                                  products of their work as free software                                  are still expected to work on specific                                  problems                                  so i think there might be um                                  a bias in the kinds of open source                                  software that                                  free software developers who are                                  employed are going to focus their                                  attention on                                  and maybe it's more like developing new                                  features that are needed for this                                  particular company                                  and maybe not so much maintaining stuff                                  that is really at the core                                  infrastructure but again like i'm not                                  a free software developer so if what i'm                                  saying is totally wrong                                  feel free to correct me but i think it's                                  important to basically                                  step in where the market does not                                  automatically provide for the funding                                  that is needed                                  okay then i think a final question                                  um there are questions about having like                                  an                                  open source tax approach so um                                  for example one percent tax to all                                  proprietary software                                  sales um and then distribute that money                                  back into the                                  open source ecosystem um                                  do you think this could be a feasible                                  approach um i mean                                  personally i like it i just know that a                                  lot of politicians get very scared when                                  you approach                                  when you propose tax increases like it's                                  something that is                                  often not very popular uh otherwise we                                  would probably have it                                  in more areas but personally i think                                  this is kind of                                  a a nice idea                                  okay then let's see uh there's one                                  final question actually um more on                                  germany there recently                                  has the um day the                                  uh sprint sprint i think it is                                  yeah the uh you know agency for                                  innovation for leap innovation                                  and how is that connected to your uh to                                  the                                  funding of open source yeah i think i                                  think they are                                  uh really great and are really bringing                                  some innovative thinking                                  into the german government and we have                                  talked to them about this idea                                  um i think one of the restrictions that                                  also                                  uh sprint is having is again this idea                                  that it's just about innovation and i                                  think you know funding innovation is                                  great                                  but i think we need to create sort of a                                  broader understanding in the german                                  government that in order to have                                  innovation you have to fund the basic                                  technology like                                  we've just learned this with the                                  coronavirus you know like in order to                                  have                                  a new vaccine you have to fund the basic                                  research that gets you there                                  and i think the same is true for for                                  innovation                                  in the tech tech sector                                  you
