Title: #FOSSBack: Monica Sarbu - Managing distributed teams from your pyjamas
Publication date: 2021-02-25
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Almost any open-source project of a certain size is powered by a globally distributed team. Different contributors from different parts of the globe have a similar interest and gather virtually to work on it, often in their free time. Many people underestimate the potential of building a valuable product this way, but today no one can ignore the incredible impact that open-source had on our technological progress. There are thousands of open-source projects that have anywhere from one to thousands of contributors. Each of them has a leader or some sort of steering committee and most of them work in a fairly similar way. If you think about it, this is by far the most successful model of software development.
There are many ideas that can be taken from the “open source way” of building a product that you can apply to manage any type of distributed team working on any type of project. The open-source model has shown us that we can work efficiently in an async way, across multiple timezones, that allows people to combine their personal life with building successful products. 

Monica will share her experiences in building and leading several globally distributed teams of paid engineers working on open source projects.  She gained her experience on building an open-source project and a community around it by starting Packetbeat, which was acquired by Elastic. Packetbeat was the starting point of the Beats project, which is one of the most downloaded products of Elastic with over 100M downloads. Her experience continues with leading the team that develops and maintains Logstash, another very popular open-source project.

One of the things she learned during her experience is the value of 1:1 mentorship relationships and how they can be a powerful tool for encouraging and growing diverse talent. After leaving Elastic, she founded Tupu.io, a non-profit initiative that offers free mentorship for women and underrepresented groups in tech. This presentation will include the learnings from creating and running this mentorship platform.

The talk will have the following structure:

  + The open-source development model

      - Constraints: multiple locations, multiple timezones, reduced hours

      - Characteristics: async communication, PRs, code reviews

       - Benefits: scalability, sense of accomplishment, leadership

       - Concerns: inclusion, lack of professionalism 

   + The open-source development model for teams:

       - Autonomy, flexible working schedule

       - Favor async communication, but still take advantage of the technology

        - How can you still do performance management? Don’t count PRs

     + Mentorship

        - The value of mentorship for increasing diversity and inclusivity

        - The mission of tupu.io and how you can help as well

	                              today i'm going to talk about                               managing distributed themes from your                               pajamas                               um so a bit about myself uh                               in the last six years i was leading                               everybody teams at elastic                               which is the company behind the open                               source project                               elasticsearch kibana beats logstash                                and also giants farm and starting with                                last year                                i started two new companies                                and one of them exata exeter                                is offering servers                                database for gemstack applications                                and also tupo which is a non-profit                                organization                                to help that offers                                free mentorship for non-representative                                people in tech um okay                                so let's start with uh how                                explaining a bit about these three types                                of engineering teams                                so the first is the classical one uh the                                onside where basically                                everyone is working from an office uh                                then remote basically when                                people or when the company starts to                                hire people um are working remotely in                                addition to the                                to the people that are working in an                                office so basically it's a mixture                                and the third type is a team that is                                fully distributed people are working                                from home                                particularly very similar with what we                                are experiencing now                                in this pandemic times um                                a few years ago many people had doubts                                about the productivity of a fully                                distributed team                                um and though you know there are so many                                successful open source projects that                                kind of prove that                                you can build a successful                                product with people uh                                spread around the world and you know                                there are                                such great examples like linux kernel uh                                firefox ubuntu mysql kubernetes and this                                is just a few of those right um                                and also there are many companies that                                kind of took this model                                of an open source um model and they were                                fully distributed from                                and here also you you can see a few                                examples                                uh like elastic sketch uh of zero                                gitlab stack overflow and many many                                others                                um but then you know corona uh came                                and and basically people were forced to                                work from home uh during this mundane                                times and                                many companies struggled there because                                overnight they had to change                                their style of working from an                                office culture to a kind of a                                distributed culture right and this is                                this is challenging because you know                                both they have nothing in common so you                                have to                                everything everything more or less from                                scratch how you are working with your                                team                                and how you are becoming productive and                                things like this                                so that's why i want to talk today about                                the distributed world model and let's                                start                                with some advantages so what advantages                                you as an                                employee of a distributed company have                                and uh first one is that you are working                                from home                                um so you you don't have to commute to                                work                                and maybe for hopefully for many of you                                this is not a problem because                                you probably have to have you have a                                short commute time to work                                but for many people there especially                                people in us                                where they have to uh go to work uh                                of one hour and then come another hour                                so they will basically save two hours of                                their life                                and work on something else that makes                                them happy                                 so flexible schedule is also another um                                 advantage basically you are not forced                                 to do the entire work in a in a big slot                                 you know the traditional nine to five                                 you are able to                                 um to plan your day                                 um as you want and                                 so and and also to have time to do                                 something else uh                                 in between um so this also life                                 allows you to have a better work life                                 balance                                 um which is kind of is a big advantage                                 in my opinion                                 because it allows you to uh                                 to do other things that you know                                 makes you um fulfilled                                 in one sense so you can for example um                                 you know go to the doctor whenever you                                 want in the middle of the day                                 you can uh go and attend                                 a sport event of your kid you can take                                 your kids uh                                 early uh for school uh without                                 you know feeling guilty that you are                                 leaving uh the office at                                       and things like this right and in the                                 end i think this is what                                 makes them makes people happy right                                 being able to                                 to do what you like and also                                 um you know you don't have to                                 uh sacrifice some personal                                 um projects if you want                                 in order to be able to have a career                                 i think this is what makes most of the                                 people happy                                 um so that's in my opinion that's a big                                 advantage                                 and you know no need to relocate so                                 in a traditional way you're probably                                 you've seen an uh job offer uh in in a                                 big city                                 so if you're living in a small in a                                 small village for example                                 you had to move and to a big city in                                 order to have                                 a particular job but with this model                                 basically                                 you can have your desired career                                 without you know moving the place that                                 you                                 love to to to to leave                                 um so let's see also you know we've seen                                 a lot of advantages what people                                 from you know from your advantages but                                 let's see                                 what are the company advantages so i                                 think in my opinion you know                                 being having happy employees uh                                 this will make them like unlikely to                                 leave the company                                 because you know they are happy they                                 want to continue working                                 for this amazing company and this will                                 also                                 make people more motivated right because                                 they want to                                 um they want to put their efforts                                 um more effort in making the product                                 that they are building more success                                 because they really believe and they                                 really want                                 the companies to be successful in order                                 not to lose these benefits                                 right and there were some studies                                 and here there was a survey uh made by                                 kosovo cloud in                                      that show that this district model also                                 increased productivity                                 and there are so many um                                 you know things that you can reach                                 to kind of prove that a distributed                                 model increased                                 increases productivity which people kind                                 of had doubts                                 um you know for a lot of time and in                                 this survey                                 um                                                                     were interviewed                                 say that they are willing to work uh for                                 longer hours                                 to get more done um there are                                    but they said that they're less likely                                 to take time off                                 uh                                                                      are accomplishing                                 more in less time and what is                                 interesting is that                                    of those they have                                 uh um you know unimproved productivity                                 while working from home                                 another big advantage for a company is                                 that you can hire the best                                 talent across the region across a                                 continent or across                                 uh even the globe right so you are not                                 restricted to um to                                 um to a city right                                 so with this you can basically                                 have more better qualified people                                 right in your company um                                 and then i mean if you are building you                                 know a company that                                 uh so you need to have uh support                                 coverage you know being distributed                                 helps you right you uh you                                 if you want to cover another time zone                                 you hire another person in                                 that another time zone you don't have to                                 find                                 ways how to um                                 you know put people work in different                                 shifts uh                                 work during the nights and work you know                                 as you know a certain time frame during                                 the day                                 in order to cover other time zones                                 and you know there are so many                                 statistics there they say that the worst                                 teams build                                 better products and let's think a bit                                 about this so what i mean by diversity                                 not necessarily about gender i guess                                 most of you here                                 think about this but other things means                                 also that                                 you know teams or people that have                                 a different background a different                                 nationality a different culture                                 and imagine that this is also important                                 because                                 imagine that you are building your                                 company is building rack                                 for for                                 [Music]                                 to be used by you know different                                 different people around the world                                 and if you your team will be                                 consisting of only off let's say                                 white males that did the same uh                                 the same prestigious university uh in us                                 they probably have the same ideas and                                 you know                                 the audience that they are building the                                 pro this product                                 is very diverse he's very different and                                 they have                                 different patients from this product so                                 by                                 basically having a diverse team                                 you kind of have diverse ideas                                 that go into and to into this product                                 and then the product will be yeah                                 have better results and will be better                                 appreciated by um by a wider audience of                                 of your users um                                 so there are some statistics done uh                                 in                                              that cell diverse teams have                                            higher revenue                                 due to innovation and what i mean by                                 diverse they took into account                                 gender nationality career                                 industry age and education and basically                                 you see here                                 uh that companies with                                 um below average uh in diversity                                 you know lowered the score lower                                 um for for innovation                                 okay so let's see now uh from a                                 perspective of a manager                                 like what are the things that you need                                 to take into account when managing a                                 distributed team                                 so let's start with the challenges um                                 and obvious first one is                                 communication                                 because i think the most difficult is to                                 keep everyone on the same page and                                 the way we we managed to do that for                                 example                                 elastic was to um                                 you kind of need to learn to be more                                 organized                                 to take notes uh when you are having                                 a meeting call uh                                 just to be um available for everyone in                                 the team maybe the one outside the team                                 that kind of need to have um                                 an outcome of that meeting                                 um work independently it's                                 a challenge especially you know for                                 um those people just finnish university                                 and they don't really have experience                                 with a working environment i i                                 personally believe that it's kind of                                 difficult for them to                                 uh to adjust because they need a bit                                 more coaching                                 which is in my opinion a bit challenging                                 to be done                                 uh over you know in a distributed manner                                 time zones um time zones is                                 in my opinion challenging um                                 when you know the the team that you are                                 little distributed across the continents                                 for example at elastic i was leading                                 teams there                                 based in u.s east coast west coast and                                 also europe                                 uh and for a shorter period of time i                                 also managed um                                 mit there were people from asia                                 and it was kind of challenging for us to                                 find                                 time for for our meetings that fit                                 everyone                                 so i believe that time zone is really a                                 big challenge when you have to cover                                 when you have your team from all the                                 continents you know from                                 asia and and um or australia                                 uh europe and the u.s                                 isolation is something that i think you                                 need to be aware of                                 and make some effort                                 to avoid that                                 especially when you hire people you know                                 when you have someone in a new time zone                                 than the other team members and                                 sometimes                                 this can feel that person                                 can feel isolated and i think it's                                 important to                                 to make sure you have a big                                 overlap meaning a few hours a day                                 between the team members in order to be                                 with you to synchronize with                                 our work i think this is indian                                 um                                 the the most important thing because                                 i feel like if you have very                                 very good and talented people in the                                 company                                 they are very motivated they are very                                 willing to to do whatever they can                                 in order to make the company succeed to                                 make the product succeed                                 often your work is                                 um is happening and you have to                                 be careful when someone is approaching                                 uh born out because you know when you're                                 working from home it's very                                 difficult to um                                 you know to to turn you off because it's                                 hard to                                 make this differentiation between you                                 know                                 uh your personal life and work and                                 sometimes you say okay i got a slack                                 message                                 why not that's like a message right so                                 sometimes it's hard to to make this                                 okay so let's talk about collaboration                                 um                                 yeah so i was saying that it's very                                 important to use the right tools for                                 video conferencing                                 and i think we are living now in an era                                 there are so many options there                                 for example elastic we use room and                                 slack a giant's phone we use google meat                                 and slack but i think it's important                                 that                                 you to learn to                                 to reduce the distractions because i                                 think                                 you have you can easily have a few                                 thousands of female in a day a few                                 really a lot of notifications on slack                                 um and a few messages from your family                                 and friends and i think                                 this can be overwhelming for uh                                 for you so i think it's important to                                 plan your day                                 in order to to you know say you know                                 some people say i do emails                                 and only in this period of time in the                                 morning and                                 in order to be able also to do some work                                 done                                 during the day um and that's why i think                                 it's                                 important to to learn to um                                 work more asynchronously than                                 asynchronously in a distributed company                                 so what that means for example imagine                                 that you are engineer                                 and you have a problem and you don't                                 know the answer and you need some help                                 for it                                 and basically you will need to um ask                                 another colleague                                 uh you know about a solution                                 a possible solution and then you will                                 probably use slack                                 in order to get an immediate response                                 but this sometimes you know if you are                                 always um asking direct                                 you know synchronously this can                                 overwhelming for someone                                 and so for example more asynchronous                                 way you basically you know you are an                                 engineer                                 you create a pull request with your                                 feature                                 and then you basically                                 ask for a feedback from other colleagues                                 um in that pure request in github                                 and then you wait a few days maybe to to                                 get the feedback                                 but this also makes you um                                 [Music]                                 you know you makes yourself feel like                                 you are stuck if you need to wait for a                                 few days for                                 you know for a feedback and i think you                                 know this                                 the reality is that you need to to learn                                 to                                 um to do things in part basically not to                                 wait for one                                 uh one feedback or one answer                                 and to work on multiple things um on the                                 same time                                 in order not to be blocked by one so it                                 this kind of requires                                 maybe a bit of adjustment from my point                                 of view                                 but you know people have this uh                                 impression that                                 they're if they're working from home                                 then they kind of need to be available                                 you know                                                      basically people do and also the way i                                 also did it is that you                                 block your calendar and also with                                 personal things so                                 like you need to go to the doctor or                                 you need to also spend time                                 with your family probably you know there                                 are some people that are very                                 for them it's very important to you know                                 to have this two hours in the evening to                                 have dinner with the family i don't know                                 things like this right                                 um you also block you know                                 the time where you are sleeping and and                                 this is important right especially                                 if your team is distributed                                 um across multiple time zones you know                                 that                                 might be difficult for someone to know                                 when basically you are sleeping                                 um yeah and and also                                 another one is have regular one-on-ones                                 or over video um                                 [Music]                                 this is important because it's important                                 to                                 also know you as a manager is important                                 to know                                 how your team feels about                                 if they have any blockers and you can                                 also discuss                                 you know all the things to discuss as a                                 manager                                 as a people manager with the team you                                 can basically                                 uh you will do it over video you know i                                 think people                                 have this um um                                 people feel like if you are working from                                 home                                 then they feel like they are not able to                                 have a close connection with their                                 colleagues                                 but from my experience i feel the other                                 way around                                 i feel like if in a distributed company                                 i feel like you you will have a closer                                 connection                                 with your colleagues just because you                                 see them in their                                 uh natural environment right and if you                                 are going to new office                                 i feel like the moment you open the door                                 to the office you are a different person                                 you are more like a business person                                 right and then you just do a chit chat                                 and and and and things like this um                                 but you know when you are working in a                                 distributed environment                                 and then you have you see                                 the colleagues um you know surrounded by                                 their family and often you see                                 a colleague with their baby in their uh                                 hand during the                                 uh during the conference call you feel                                 like you know                                 you are better um                                 or you have a closer relationship with                                 them uh                                 so i think also you know many companies                                 out there they also organize                                 face-to-face time i think this is also                                 important                                 and you know there are some means they                                 do this twice                                 or three times a year where the                                 entire team or maybe the entire company                                 is gathering                                 in one place to meet face to face i                                 think this                                 is this is something that is important                                 to have                                 um and um                                 just to also you know have some uh                                 some time with with with the people so                                 basically you                                 like like how tall this person is                                 and how this person is uh like yeah it                                 is                                 this sometimes helps so recognize work                                 um                                 [Music]                                 so i think this is something that                                 no matter if it's a distributed company                                 or not i think                                 i believe that you need to judge people                                 by their results                                 not by their working hours i think in a                                 distributed environment                                 anyway you cannot really um uh                                 you know count the number of                                 of our personal work i think from my                                 point of view                                 this is uh i think this is how i usually                                 evaluate people                                 like their results over a longer period                                 of time usually a few months                                 um and this is also a lot allows them                                 to innovate and from my point of view                                 this is                                 really the most important thing is to                                 offer um engineers to                                 uh to have the freedom to uh to innovate                                 and                                 another thing is like okay they they                                 come up with new ideas but i think it's                                 important to give early feedback                                 and you know not wait for um                                 [Music]                                 for uh for the you know for the idea to                                 um                                 to become bigger and uh before                                 you you give a feedback career graph                                 i think this is um and i feel like when                                 in a distributed environment i feel like                                 you                                 kind of need to trust people more um                                 just because i think people like feel                                 like                                 they can trust someone if they see                                 someone near there                                 in the in the office but i think maybe                                 you know in in in a distributed                                 environment you need to trust people                                 more                                 um yeah um                                 yeah from from from the beginning um                                 i think it's important to encourage                                 people to drive projects by themselves                                 um because                                 yeah i know we are a bit of a bit late                                 here                                 so uh um i think an important                                 um an important thing to                                 um to to you as a manager to
