Title: #FOSSBack: Thomas Fricke - Digital Sovereignty Driving Open Source in Germany and Europe
Publication date: 2021-02-23
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Since mid 2019 Digital Sovereignty has been promoted by the Government in Germany, for the most of us unexpectedly. 

Behind the scenes economical motivations are driving the initiatives. Several new governmental agencies have been created, projects have been started on scale driving the administration to go digital, finally deliver a promise broken for at least twenty years.

The fear of loosing the industrial technology base to the US and Chinese cloud hyperscalers, conflicts with the US administration on political questions have created lots of activities.

Gaia-X and the Corona app are only the most prominent initiatives started directly by the German government. 

The talk tries to give an overview what is going on, tries to give an estimation what will come next, how sustainable the initiatives are, where it makes sense to demand further steps.

	                              let's                               go to it the content is a little bit i                               will talk about                               this and i will start with the history                               and the economy and then                               digital sovereignty example is gaia x                               and there are a lot of other initiatives                               which are worth mentioning at the moment                               a disclaimer is a little bit long so i                                will not read everything so i am                                not working in the public sector i'm                                just doing everything there                                for free at any moment i make my                                money with combinations and especially                                securities so this is                                enough to do a little bit of                                free work in the public sector because                                it needs it                                into that direction and i will                                [Music]                                explain what i'm doing in the moment                                or when it's important so a little bit                                of history                                um i was part of the team in                                     which promoted zusa in the deutsche                                bundestag we had                                partial success and what we had to learn                                the hard way is that there is a lot of                                they are not interested in technology                                at least at this time nobody was                                interested zeus was                                known as a nuremberg company and not                                even the                                member of parliament of that arya and of                                the party have been                                any interest for forza and um                                we had a partial success means ibm made                                some money those are                                uh made the news or the headlines and                                then uh finally we                                received the notice that it has been                                stopped by a hard                                lobbyist who is a member of the atlantic                                bridge                                lobbying the council defense industry so                                we                                never never before i've met people                                with such destructive power                                and outside the public sector uh open                                source                                developed quite well from the very early                                beginnings when                                uh kyle's computer club in                                     has been funded everything was there but                                they did not coin                                it or frame it as a digital solidity but                                if you read the                                the manifests it's very close to this we                                had a lot of conferences here partially                                organized by                                uh the team or the predecessor of the                                team                                which is giving the conference here we                                had the linux star                                chemists in brussels the first time and                                in                                                                                                    become big and wanted to have this                                um cloud like business and they adapted                                linux because it was all cheaper so one                                of the first                                really huge commercial adoptions was                                quite                                nearly                                                                 of                                organizations available and                                as you might have noticed all the                                startups in berlin are the                                not anymore startups like zellando                                immorbilian scout all the                                idiot all the bigger things i cannot                                name them all                                are using open source software kind of                                they are promoting open source they have                                an                                inner source program and it's                                it's working quite well if we talk about                                economy                                we have to know the standard patterns so                                that's a                                making money capital accumulation and                                general pattern is to privatize the                                profits and socialize the losses so                                this is one of these common patterns                                which we                                really don't like but it's you will face                                it everywhere                                and you have a politics of interest                                which is not even                                 uh easy to explain in english because                                 politics of interest is always                                 economically framed in english so it's                                 kind of lobbyism                                 you have a lot of psychological                                 psychology greed                                 thought and all the other things                                 and everything important it's all                                 sometimes it's important to                                 know what is not mentioned so this is                                 called the reader deconstruction i                                 will present the slides with all the                                 links in it                                 and we will see what this means in a few                                 minutes                                 does money make open source go around                                 here is a list                                 of the last acquisitions in the open                                 source business so public                                 um open source companies have been                                 bought by other                                 biggest one is red hat bought by ibm                                                                                             that it will have an ipo this year about                                                                           docker failed to get acquired by                                 microsoft                                 because they didn't want it                                 rancher has been acquired by zuza and so                                 on we have we have hundreds of millions                                 of acquisitions in open source so it                                 looks like it is a big business but on                                 the other side if you look                                 what which companies had the most profit                                 of open source                                 apple was a bsd kernel microsoft which                                 is                                 using uh canonical our ubuntu software                                 in                                 in its cloud amazon and google they are                                 uh thousands of millions so in german we                                 have this                                 billion american it's trillion so don't                                 mix it                                 and if we compare to the next bigger                                 companies like                                 tesla sap or in germany                                 they are factor of                                       compared to the open source companies                                 factor                                    bigger than the open source company so                                 open source                                 a billion in open source looks big but                                 compared to the big platforms or the                                 hyperscalers                                 is not a huge number one site remark                                 uh germany always is proud of having                                 found the ip                                 the mp                                                                  money they uh earned by patents                                 and compared to the value of spotify so                                 the platform versus uh                                 um whether it's a patent uh business                                 it's a factor of system                                 [Music]                                 and they're considered as large                                 companies but uh                                 compared to the hyperscalers they're                                 really small                                 and if you compare to the money which                                 has been                                 owed by private households in germany                                 this is                                 now even bigger it's nearly                                   billion or trillion for the americans                                 money so it's a                                 a huge number so what um it doesn't look                                 like that that money is a problem but we                                 have another problem here                                 uh which is the investment is not really                                 working well so we had we are in the                                 middle of the pandemic and even the most                                 prominent companies kurovac and biontech                                 which are                                 now big pharma business                                 they had difficulties to get money for                                 for their business so they need to ask                                 the government                                 for investment and not the vc market so                                 the vc market                                 in europe is completely defined so all                                 the companies which are successful are                                 bought by other                                 american funds and this is                                 a big problem here that we cannot really                                 um do the funding on that big scale this                                 is a                                 reason why the american platforms are so                                 successful                                 we could do other things of course we                                 could raise the taxes on property                                 or taxes the big platforms like anova                                 like like amazon but as already it has                                 been mentioned that                                 rising the taxes in germany is                                 quite hard and this is not capitalism by                                 by its own by the way you are all so                                 have                                 big governmental investments which are                                 going                                 completely in the wrong direction so                                 what can we do                                 uh on that and uh compared to what what                                 is the value of open source what are                                 what are we contributing here and then                                 here it only counts not the social                                 aspect                                 then not we are free developers sorry                                 for that i am                                 very very much um with a resistance back                                 but here                                 if we look into the numbers we see uh                                 by the linux foundation survey                                           developers are                                 european-based and                                 we make a one-third of the actual growth                                 with                                 the software in new products and this                                 there's another study                                 that                                                              products are open source so effectively                                 um there is a quarter of the growers                                 directly related to open source of in                                 europe so we have to claim this uh                                 success and we have to                                 also claim some back for this money or                                 we already made there's a                                 new study quantification                                 which says we are making uh every year                                 in the open source business in europe                                    billion so nearly                                                      is a                                 contribution to the gdp so this is a big                                 number and this                                 is now on the table and                                 politics is really paying attention to                                 it at the moment                                 but his question is do we pay the right                                 attention                                 one of the guys in the german open                                 source business is rafael laguna                                 he founded open exchange                                 where he was ceo now he is the founding                                 director of the sprint                                 bundesliga for spring innovation and he                                 is                                 promoting open source on the government                                 level there's an interview                                 uh and uh what i very much like and what                                 i don't like                                 for example it's a little solution                                 here's a pacifist at heart i'm also                                 so if i'm not part of the open source                                 business or one of the organizations                                 uh big organization because they have                                 too much                                 uh promoting for the military business                                 and uh the more or less the tipping                                 point was this                                                                                        christian democratic party had their                                 yearly pathetic so they and he could                                 announce                                 that open source is now the government                                 politics so so the biggest party in                                 germany which                                 which the longest longest tradition of                                 governing has now adopted open source                                 and they are framing a difference they                                 are framing it                                 digital is versatile so vicious wonder                                 is one of the things                                 you should uh smile on but                                 it's effectively it's a miracle                                 and it's a fairy tale so don't believe                                 in fairy tales but it's a framing which                                 says okay                                 it's as relevant as it can be for the                                 german                                 economy there are other things                                 everybody wants to be on that list                                 but this is more interesting for the                                 german                                 politics and behind the scenes uh there                                 is                                 another motivation for going open source                                 we have been                                 had this trump administration for four                                 years and                                 it really threatened the independence of                                 europe and                                 there have been sanctions on decisions                                 if they are wrong or not but the                                 sanctions for                                 where should be sovereign was not                                 recognized                                 as a very positive sign and they                                 immediately started and this                                 digital sovereignty we will still have                                 to define it                                 took off and uh                                 yeah the bigger thing uh which was never                                 mentioned                                 in the official news was that there was                                 a fear of a potential cloud boycott so                                 sources in the german government told me                                 that they have been afraid that not only                                 the pipeline and the                                 um and                                 technology boycotts on the day on the                                 oil pipeline not the data pipelines the                                 old pipeline to russia                                 um have been                                 threatened but also there was an                                 embargo under the hood um                                 that uh germany would be cut off the                                 cloud so no amazon no google uh                                 no facebook anymore so this was one real                                 threat and then they                                 uh analyzed it and there was a study                                 a strategic marked analysis reducing the                                 dependency                                 on open source of software                                 windows and it came out surprise                                 surprise they are                                 heavily depending on                                 on software windows on proprietary                                 software windows                                 another um                                 another threat in the blog is uh the                                 data so so it's not only about open                                 source it's also about data                                 and in                                      and uh later they framed this digital                                 and data is the new oil i absolutely                                 hate this                                 framing as a new oil because uh what                                 it's effectively meaning                                 you can see here uh you see yeah                                 um what will be our deep water horizon                                 so this is not something                                 which is predictable it already has                                 happened we                                 see a lot of breaches and and where                                 data is somebody will try to catch it                                 and to get out of it                                 and what we also see is that they                                 commanded a lot of                                 things so the official                                 line of the government is not very                                 unambiguous so somebody says yeah we                                 want to have everything free and                                 anything                                 and in the same same                                 department they say okay we make this                                 i.t security uh because that's                                 a law which is effectively restricting                                 our freedom and this uh                                 for all the non-germans these germans                                 violence fantasies are propagating to                                 the euro                                 european level and come back and then                                 they go into law this is not a big                                 not a very friendly approach on that                                 the role of the hyperscalers is very                                 questionable so uh                                 you have seen the value is in the                                 trillions or                                 german billions of money and what                                 we also don't like is that they are                                 aggravating customer and partner data on                                 a big scale                                 and amazon is very famous for squeezing                                 partners out of the business                                 and corey doctorov calls the um                                 amazon ecosystem the kill zone so                                 effectively our                                 entire economy will be killed because of                                 these business practices and                                 we have seen notorious gdpr violations                                 the cloud act                                 and customers are forced into the cloud                                 for example the office                                                                                       completely cutting us off from from                                 running our own version even even if we                                 have paid for the proprietary solution                                 so this is not really something which is                                 acceptable                                 and another thing which does not work                                 is everything about intellectual                                 property so intellectual                                 property has failed on nearly every                                 scale from                                 very big a few uh lines of few nodes in                                 music to disney laws to                                 patents on in                                 in the industry so uh and together with                                 code and data this means who owns the                                 code who owns the data                                 i think this is an unsolvable problem                                 and this is all                                 going to be addressed at the moment                                 we have intrinsic arguments here against                                 intellectual property so intrinsic means                                 only business                                 arguments it's an ineffective method of                                 control                                 it's slow um it is not really                                 um making giving us anything you have                                 seen the throne of the mp                                          fraunhofer has split in                                 separate parts there are parts say we                                 cannot open source our code because it                                 weakens all patterns                                 you say see the entire framing at the                                 moment                                 is completely wrong so other parts of                                 throne of support open source and then                                 it's a transition you see this kind of                                 transition in everywhere                                 and this is one of these strategic                                 market analysis so                                 they they say uh in in a pdf                                 uh yeah we are depending on                                 microsoft and other software providers                                 and this is something i                                 i'll just linked it if you want to read                                 it but this is what we told them                                                                                   these are consultants yeah they are paid                                 a lot                                 and uh here is a positive thing so now i                                 will talk about digital sovereignty                                 and sovereignty itself is quite                                 difficult wording so in in the us                                 serenity is related a little bit to                                 uh extreme right if you                                 don't take care and in this case digital                                 sovereignty means um the best definition                                 i have seen here is from peter guns                                 it's a concept that you as an individual                                 an organization or a state                                 uh allow to determine where                                 you want to um place your personal data                                 and how it should be used and this is                                 this is something which is absolutely                                 comfortable even to the chaos computer                                 club                                 this is this is working in a way that we                                 can                                 say okay this is a definition we can                                 can work on and this is the definition                                 we can                                 really use even in our contracts                                 and he has declared four principles i                                 think it's a little bit analog to the                                 four freedoms of the gpl                                 and yeah                                 you need the right uh to store the data                                 wherever you want                                 it should be there should be standards                                 or standards should be open source                                 um and cloud services must be in a way                                 that you follow the principles of the                                 internet                                 the open citizens must be interconnected                                 without the need and the consent of a                                 central                                 authority and education is a big part of                                 the concept so you really need to                                 educate people on it                                 and then one of these outcomes was this                                 project                                 guide so this is our bonus minister                                 admirer so he's a secretary of state                                 in the department of                                 business or of economy and energy                                 and they very much claimed here we have                                 this digital summit and now we are                                 promoting it and                                 and uh he's missing on this photo                                 because                                 he was so excited about this new step                                 that he                                 immediately had an accident and                                 fall off the stairs and and he was not                                 able to attend                                 what you also see is there is a lot of                                 a lot of people here will not really                                 contribute                                 to the digital development of germany                                 um the worst guy is uh                                 um is a official one of the official                                 digital ministers of attack telemetry                                 communication                                 and traffic and here is the reality in                                 germany                                                              digital summit                                 the fastest way of transporting data is                                 by horse with                                 which dvd on it and                                 by using the book by by                                 promoting the internet in mecklenburg                                 football in the east in east germany                                 um they have effectively cut off the                                 telephone lines because                                 the line the digital                                 wireless networks the phone network is                                 so weak that you cannot carry voice over                                 ap                                 and then some parts of                                 eastern germany have really no                                 access to the internet which is a                                 catastrophe                                 in times of pandemic                                 okay the next step was uh yes                                 as yuria already mentioned there is no                                 single country which can govern open                                 source process so                                 first invitation always goes to france                                 and so the outcome is an european                                 initiative                                 so it's uh at the end it will be                                 an uh aisbo so it's                                 by belgian law it's a association                                 international                                 but lucrative and you have                                                                                              industry so this means                                 it's not a government-run project                                 anymore it's an industry-run product and                                 this is                                 very much constructed of does the way                                 um the german internet is constructed so                                 the d                                     also um                                 a german gunmetal shaft so it's also a                                 non-profit organization                                 and they build all the backbones and the                                 internet                                 uh traffic in germany it works quite                                 well                                 and um yeah you will have                                     members which means um there is a big                                 support                                 by the german uh and the european                                 industry so                                 so it's really um on an industrial scale                                 you see all the                                 uh all the participants i've worked for                                 seven of them uh not related with gaia x                                 but                                 uh yeah so this is more or less a good                                 representation                                 but also uh this palantiyan is not the                                 drupal volunteer is a volunteer which is                                 uh responsible for the surveillance                                 everywhere                                 wanted to attend which means to                                 uh we needed a clarification so the                                 clarification here is definitely is this                                 is                                 everybody has one vote if you are in                                 this ispl                                 and if you are google or if you are a                                 small company                                 you have the same number of votes which                                 is exactly one so if palantir wants to                                 join                                 and they can join then they have exactly                                 one vote                                 and not cannot dominate even if the big                                 cloud the hyperscalers                                 would attend they only would have one                                 voice                                 so politics we already mentioned what is                                 gaia x by the way you see a lot of                                 interesting colored slides and here it                                 is about the data spaces                                 it's about connecting data and software                                 here is                                 where i feel a little bit more familiar                                 effectively                                 it's an openstack cluster or some                                 platform                                 and there's kind of kubernetes on top of                                 it with all the                                 network uh issues and the connections                                 um so this is where why i feel home in                                 the ix project so i know                                 most of the technologies and this is                                 quite                                 an interesting technology                                 stack it's quite complicated but it                                 works                                 and here you see what they intend they                                 want to have a federated system of                                 independent clouds and they can have                                 different levels from a very public                                 level to a very                                 isolated level and they all come can be                                 interconnected in a very very defined                                 way so your data can flow                                 from your hospital into a cloud                                 provider's data center in a very defined                                 and protected flow this is the intention                                 behind it                                 and there is the sovereign cloud stack                                 which is more or less a hello world of                                 gaia x it is on github and the people                                 who brought it there are                                 it's more or less the creme de la creme                                 of the german open source                                 um developer so-called                                 garlov is the main driver and he was                                 one of the troll developers at zusa                                 and and peter gunn and the other also                                 contribute a lot of                                 the politics and code in this project                                 what else there is a demonstrator you                                 can click it                                 it effectively feels like linux in                                                                                                younger so i like it but it's definitely                                 not                                 finished yet it will be available end of                                 the year you will have                                 there are already demonstrators how it                                 works so please                                 try it out and and if you are able to                                 contribute                                 please contribute                                 another thing which is quite interesting                                 was a corona app so effectively the                                 highest                                 instance of computer security is not                                 um it's not an official institution but                                 it's a chaos computer computer has                                 absolutely v                                                       they don't like your solution and can                                 cricket in                                 the live session um it's done so what                                 happened to the german                                 eid personalized wise and                                 here with this activity                                 for in the german corona app they                                 gain more that's the highest level of                                 supports of cars computer computer club                                 said we cannot complain so this is more                                 or less                                 uh what you need and then the                                 initiatives uh took off so this is one                                 this                                 the german digital secretary of state is                                 marcus victor                                 bond he is more or less a cio                                 of the german government                                 computing so uh and he is driving                                 a lot of initiatives christina lung and                                 she's a co-founder of tech for germany                                 it's supported from another                                 digital secretary of state council arms                                 missile sources is the highest                                 um people in in germany support at the                                 moment open source under the                                 this is quite necessary because the                                 biggest project i know of at the moment                                 is the online touring squad so it's                                 online access law                                 it's a law which                                 requires that every                                 buddhist land every country in in                                 germany and every                                 contributor puts one of these building                                 blocks of the entire german                                 administration                                 into an open source project so this is a                                 real huge open source project                                 and it must everything must be open                                 source and it's                                 based on kubernetes so you see a lot of                                 micro services here and if you                                 have ever worked in a bigger                                 microservice problem this means we have                                 you have a real huge distributed system                                                                     services which turns out to be                                 whatever few thousand different micro                                 different containers uh there is                                 it enforces automatically a different                                 organization                                 cicd pipelines uh security                                 process changes everything you need you                                 have to address a tech                                 vector because this will be a                                 first-class target                                 and this does not work with open source                                 and everybody knows that                                 it's not possible to build this                                 with proprietary solutions                                 so yeah this is a standard                                 control council they complained a lot of                                 the government in germany this is                                 something i've been part of                                 this there will be a governmental code                                 for not because we                                 are not able to use                                 github but because we have as you                                 already mentioned                                 um we have to lower                                 as a barrier to contributions this means                                 uh every it should be easy for everybody                                 in the german administrative                                 administration to contribute to code to                                 take hold and it should be legally                                 compliant                                 and there should be everything                                 integratable it could be integrated in                                 ix it will be opened of course                                 um it will be another open source                                 repository where you where the german                                 government                                 hopefully will guarantee that this                                 code which is there is compliant to all                                 the rules and all the laws                                 and then it can be reused in europe and                                 we will also reuse a lot of code from                                 other european countries and                                 um already in the news is the planning                                 for the center                                 of digital sovereignty i am disclaimer                                 i'm under nda but what you can read in                                 the news                                 already without me breaking the nda                                 is that it will be a very huge                                 hospital and it will be um                                 [Music]                                 have a lot of connections to all other                                 ospos and open source projects without                                 taking over                                 open source products it cannot really                                 control everything but it will be a                                 big and and first stop for all                                 um projects which have relations to the                                 government                                 in the near future                                 another thing personally because i like                                 also the approach of getting independent                                 of                                 the hardware dependencies the risk                                   project is taking off in europe uh                                 because nvidia has acquired arm for                                    billion                                 it's hardware so therefore i did not                                 mention it                                 intel more or less is in a burnt out                                 state                                 but it's more or less not usable anymore                                 in a security                                 environment and risk                                   will be an independent architecture                                 because the risk                                                         the bsd license so we can use it and                                 there are                                 european initiatives uh which will be                                 hopefully                                 in the next few years lead to                                 completely independent hardware so                                 hopefully see                                 processors supercomputer processors                                 which are faster than what we see at the                                 moment                                 from the big contributors in                                       what is missing not everything is                                 is under open source and some of the                                 promises                                 are still broken even the german health                                 system gematic is delivering but not                                 everything i i think and what is                                 not delivered at the moment is the                                 source code of the bundeswehr                                 passport systems and they                                 try behind the scenes because they are                                 controlled by secret services in germany                                 uh                                 to get to keep as much control as                                 possible                                 and this will be um it's a little bit                                 sad because                                 uh some of these initiatives to get your                                 passport on your mobile phone                                 should and must be open source and                                 uh otherwise they will be broken and i'm                                 looking forward to                                 the talks where somebody on stage is                                 going to break it and                                 to break out of the secure samsung                                 containers                                 it's a challenge but                                 [Music]                                 what i've seen so far is that there are                                 people who will make a                                 phd thesis out of it so the conclusions                                 at the moment yeah uh open source is                                 um going big in                                 uh business now and accepted by the                                 government                                 and we see a lot of progress we are in                                 the transition phase                                 we have many gaps partly public sector                                 has an absolutely brown field so there                                 is no something                                 we can write new code from scratch                                 projects are struggling but not by                                 technical issues                                 even even individual efforts can have a                                 big impact if you                                 promote it to the right person you will                                 be                                 invited to a board where you can decide                                 so                                 stay tuned fighting for this kind of                                 data sovereignty is a big driver in the                                 german government at the moment                                 see a lot of progress a lot of building                                 areas uh and it's important                                 so yeah that's what i wanted to tell you                                 if you want to                                 contact me uh i will be in the right                                 position                                 after this let's                                 let's go and                                 thank you very much uh thomas for your                                 talk                                 um yes there is actually there is one                                 question maybe we can do that real quick                                 um before we go                                 over to the breakout room um                                 someone asked what do you think is the                                 way forward is it projects like gaia x                                 or if it's not um what do you think is                                 missing at the moment                                 uh i think gaia x is a big progress                                 because now we can build our own clouds                                 so we don't have to wear the                                 t-shirts the cloud is just another                                 guy's computer and now we will have we                                 will be able to build our own cloud in a                                 separate                                 environment it's like linux in                                      nobody would have believed that somebody                                 could clone the unix kernel and make a                                 public project out of it nobody would                                 have believed it at that time                                 but it happened and the complexity is                                 immense but we will                                 handle it and we will learn it and the                                 other things which are lacking                                 yeah we will see we have to now we can                                 make the pressure                                 um if the official institutions are on                                 board and if somebody in the government                                 asks why                                 is the software for your id card not                                 public                                 you need a reason for that                                 you
