Title: #FOSSBackstage: Simon Phipps & Rich Sands - Managing the Corporate-Community Boundary
Publication date: 2021-02-25
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	So you work for a corporation but are part of a community. Doing something controversial? Have lots of internal stakeholders with conflicting needs? Changing course in a way that makes people suspicious or concerned? Write an FAQ! No, really!

Do it not just for the FAQ itself, but for the process of aligning everyone behind a single, open strategy. If you can answer the hard questions publicly, honestly, and confidently, you’ll foster trust and build good will even when your audience does not hear the exact answers they want. What’s more, the feedback will give you the input you need to correct any errors you have in fact made.

In this talk, we’ll look at how to use an FAQ as tool and an excuse to:

- Organize the effort.
- Force decision makers and leaders to decide on goals, craft a coherent strategy, and understand and accept the tradeoffs.

 - Internally sell transparency and scrupulous honesty as essential to success.

 - Help the legal team be a partner, instead of just saying “no”.

 - Simplify and accelerate communications and make the Marketing Department an ally.


Learning from history

I’ll be using a bit of FLOSS history to illustrate these points – Sun’s Open Source Java Initiative.

Java wasn’t always Free Software. By 2005, Sun was making a lot of money with its staunchly proprietary Java platform. Richard Stallman called it a seductive “trap”. Under pressure from FLOSS community leaders to open source Java and turn it into a compelling example of the new model, Sun listened.

Those of us on the Java team were just as surprised as the rest of the software world by the announcement. Immediately, the questions started pouring in: Which license? How to encourage and manage contributions? What happens to the brand, and to Java’s “Write Once, Run Anywhere” compatibility promise? How does Sun continue to make money with Java, when the code is out there for anyone to use without paying a fee?

Sun didn’t know the answers. And these questions were in the minds of Sun’s customers, competitors, and knowledgeable FLOSS leaders. We needed a way to:



 - Answer the hard questions consistently and in one place so everyone would know.

 - Get the whole company on board, including management, lawyers, salespeople, engineers, and marketing personnel.

 - Communicate the answers successfully to diverse internal and external audiences.
 - Convince skeptics on both sides that this initiative would succeed in future-proofing Java’s business while keeping the platform relevant and exciting.



Thus was born the “Open Source Java FAQ”, which was inspired by an earlier FAQ done for the Debian community, and grew to 200 questions. It would prove to be a key tool in solving these problems.

uh rich and i used to work at some                               microsystems                               which is getting to the point now where                               some of the younger viewers                               may not even know it ever existed um                               but sun was a dynamic and                                controversial corporation um that                                expired                                in                                                           and while rich and i                                worked for some microsystems we were                                both                                involved in making the java platform                                open source                                and that was a controversial thing                                at the time and we're going to explain a                                little bit about why it was                                controversial                                and we're going to explain a little bit                                about what we did                                to try and make java go open source                                smoothly                                in that process my role was                                as the the chief open source officer at                                sun i was the head of open source                                i was running one of the industry's                                first open source                                program offices and the task that we're                                going to be talking about                                is very much an open source program                                office task                                uh and the tool that we're going to be                                talking about is one that i have not                                noticed                                very many modern ospos actually thinking                                about or using                                so i'd very much encourage you to                                consider                                uh using this particular approach if                                you're working in an open source program                                office                                uh ricky's role at the time was to be                                the um the the marketing guru for the                                java team                                and uh this uh the                                technique that we're using was very much                                his brainchild that he pioneered                                perfected and uh used to to great effect                                and so we're gonna we're gonna talk you                                a little bit through that and uh                                on the slides you see that there's um                                two avatars there's a little rich and a                                little simon                                and that will give you some hint who is                                uh                                going to take the lead on each of those                                slides if you come back to this talk                                later and you want to ask questions you                                can use those avatars                                as your your guide to know which of us                                to email to ask the question to                                um so uh rich is gonna take it from here                                it turns out that i'd never realized                                this rich is                                um a a competitor with randall monroe of                                xkcd because he                                he drew these so over to you rick                                well thanks simon um so so why does why                                is it so difficult for                                companies to uh communicate with                                uh communities well it's it really comes                                very                                unnaturally to companies because                                marketing departments are used to                                adjusting the message for different                                audiences                                that doesn't really work very well for                                uh for                                developer audiences so we're gonna talk                                about                                uh what happens when you've got some                                explaining to do and we we had some                                explaining to do                                and we used the really uh boring                                old-school                                technique uh of the faq to solve that                                problem uh next slide                                so companies really don't always get it                                a lot of companies uh                                nowadays get it much better than uh                                   years ago                                when we were at sun but a lot of                                companies                                just don't really understand the open                                source uh ethos                                how the way how communities work uh and                                 um even companies that do understand it                                 have a tough time sometimes                                 matching their uh expectations and                                 corporate interests                                 with uh the community's interests when                                 they don't whine                                 next                                 so um how many of you have run into this                                 problem you                                 you roll out some terrific uh                                 program that you think everyone's going                                 to love and out come the pitchforks                                 and the torches uh while this is a                                 problem that that many of us have run                                 into                                 uh and uh you know simon why don't you                                 tell talk a little about                                 um what uh some of our experiences were                                 at sun with the                                 the four the pitchforks and the uh the                                 torches                                 okay so uh in many ways some                                 microsystems was one of the first                                 companies                                 to use open source as a strategic uh                                 approach the founding of the company                                 used bsd                                 unix and used it as the operating system                                 on workstations                                 and um the one of the founders of the                                 open source movement                                 uh was one of the founders of some micro                                 systems that's bill joy                                 and he was doing that around about the                                 same time that uh richard stallman was                                 working on the east coast so uh sun's                                 history is very much                                 intertwined with the history of the free                                 and open source software movement                                 and um one of the problems with being a                                 pioneer                                 is that although you do things that are                                 that are                                 very effective and successful as a                                 pioneer when you succeed                                 a town gets built in the place where you                                 used to be the pioneer                                 and you don't fit in too well as one of                                 the towns people                                 and that was what happened with some                                 microsystems some                                 uh watched the uh open source movement                                 emerge                                 uh it always had a tense relationship                                 with the east wing of the free and open                                 source software movement                                 and um by the time we got to                                 the end of the                                          sun was uh it fairly routinely                                 in conflict with the the the                                 free software movement led by richard                                 stillman                                 java was released in                                                                                                        way that was                                 very open and fitted with its ethos and                                 the licensing around java in                                          quite                                 revolutionary it gave anybody the                                 freedom to do anything they wanted to                                 with the software                                 as long as they weren't going to make                                 money with it um                                 they i don't that sounds familiar today                                 so the the licensing                                 that java had was this pioneering                                 completely                                 uh do what you want with this code                                 license and i know that was the case                                 because i worked at ibm                                 in                                                                    ibm                                 using exactly those freedoms and the                                 the whole fact that ibm came on board                                 and popularized                                 java in the enterprise was all down to                                 sun's use of open licensing                                 now sun assumed that everybody saw the                                 worthiness and goodness of this                                 but it turned out that that wasn't the                                 case that lots of people were very upset                                 about the strong field of use                                 protections that were in the java                                 licensing                                 arrangement they were there for an                                 excellent reason as was shown when                                 microsoft tried to do a hostile fork of                                 java at the end of the                                       and the licensing proved that it worked                                 well when microsoft had to pay something                                 like a billion dollars                                 as damages for uh their uh                                 attempt to embrace extend and extinguish                                 java in the late                                        when we got to the turn of the century a                                 lot of people                                 had by that point um missed the openness                                 and the loveliness of sun                                 and uh really were um out with the                                 pitchforks and the scythes                                 uh trying to deal with us uh sun one                                 one of the sun's great flaws is it it                                 failed to notice                                 the growing power of linux and of                                 the free software movement and uh it                                 it failed to fight that by making                                 solaris                                 open source free software early in its                                 life cycle and                                 uh some said many bad things about                                 um uh linux unfortunately and in fact                                 its founder                                 uh scott mcneely was known to do exactly                                 that                                 off the cuff during interviews and so um                                 by the time we got to uh the early                                       um we had been fairly soundly denounced                                 by                                 grok law the discussion forum and we                                 had also had the delight of having                                 richard stallman                                 write this uh article where he declared                                 that java was not                                 just a trap by its licensing taking away                                 your freedoms                                 but also it created a whole class                                 of evil that would forever be called the                                 java trap                                 and so uh well in                                                        um by then it had already been                                 discussing making java open source for                                 about three                                 years and it was an unwelcome                                 development shall we say                                 that richard decided in                                      to write this article and so one of my                                 jobs as chief open source officer                                 was to go and try and uh                                 solve these problems and so uh i spent                                 quite a lot of time                                 talking with the uh with pamela jones                                 who                                 ran grock law talking with the people in                                 the free java community to understand                                 their problems                                 and we we fairly quickly came to the                                 conclusion that although                                 internally we knew we were heading in                                 the direction of open source for java                                 no one outside was ever going to believe                                 us                                 they had lots of questions and they had                                 internally in their minds answered those                                 questions in the worst possible way and                                 consequently we could come out uh                                 tomorrow back in                                                        was open source                                 and people would never trust us and so                                 um as part of the opening process we                                 learned about meeting people                                 talking with the community engaging the                                 leaders of the community                                 that we were working with we also                                 learned about not                                 um trying to compete with the community                                 and create a competing community                                 and so when we did our initial openings                                 of java                                 um that was done by putting java under a                                 free-to-use license                                 a non-free but free to use license and                                 putting it into debian's non-free                                 repository                                 and we did that in uh in                                      and we implanted a member of our staff                                 in the debian community tom marble                                 who is still there uh he he he went                                 native                                 uh fairly readily and did a fine job                                 working on java in the the debian                                 community                                 and also one of the things we did while                                 we were there was we                                 we wrote an faq explaining this                                 complicated                                 license that we used for java in the                                 world of debian                                 and and that's why when we came to                                 actually open source java in                                      rich decided that this was exactly the                                 tool to use                                 to solve all the presenting problems                                 that we had in open sourcing java                                 rich back to you thanks simon so                                 so uh next slide so                                 so we're gonna do this in the form of an                                 faq so                                 question why write an faq well                                 the number one reason to write an faq                                 like this i mean                                 you might have a community that has a                                 very simple                                 licensing there's no controversy                                 developers love you                                 they're using it they're adopting it you                                 probably don't need this kind of faq                                 but if you've got any sort of                                 controversy or things that                                 aren't aren't completely the way that                                 the community                                 would want to see it this can really                                 help you out                                 but the number one reason why you want                                 to write an faq                                 is to learn the answers to these                                 questions yourself                                 so writing an faq that really                                 peels back the onion and goes deep on                                 the strategy and what you're trying to                                 accomplish                                 forces you the company and your                                 executives                                 and across the whole company all of the                                 different departments and                                 uh stakeholders to test and refine this                                 strategy and really figure out what it                                 is you're going to do                                 get everyone on the same page so that                                 there's no disagreement                                 and no uh no cross purposes and then                                 teach all of the people who have to talk                                 about this                                 what are the messages and um                                 how to explain this strategy                                 to the community and what this allows                                 you to then do                                 is establish trust because you're being                                 completely transparent                                 you're putting everything out there on                                 the table so that                                 everyone can figure it out if you can                                 answer                                 the difficult questions about your                                 strategy intelligently                                 then you've got a coherent strategy if                                 you can't answer those questions you                                 probably need to go back to the drawing                                 board                                 next slide so who's the audience                                 well in a nutshell the audience is                                 developers                                 marketing people are comfortable with                                 having                                 this message for sale for the uh                                 customers this message for the engineers                                 different messages for different                                 audiences but that really doesn't work                                 for developer initiatives and it turns                                 out that developers are actually                                 the most difficult audience to please                                 and so that makes them the most                                 important audience because if you can                                 make your developer uh audience the                                 people you're trying                                 to get to adopt your platform if you can                                 get them                                 to be satisfied pretty much everyone                                 else is going to come along for the ride                                 and that's because everyone knows that                                 in an                                 adoption-led strategy the developers                                 really                                 hold all the cards they're the ones that                                 are going to make the decision                                 are we going to adopt this technology or                                 are we going to go use something else                                 so if you're a customer for technology                                 you're going to ask your engineers                                 how is this thing is it good is it bad                                 what what should we do                                 if if you're uh if you're

  what do you guys think of this community                                 what do you guys think of                                 of how this company is engaging so                                 really the developers are the are the                                 key audience                                 next slide                                 what's most important to developers well                                 in a nutshell                                 transparency developers want to know                                 everything there is to know                                 about your strategy the truth the whole                                 tooth                                 and nothing but the truth it's difficult                                 to do this                                 but that's why this is such a powerful                                 technique                                 so they want to know the motivations                                 what are your goals what are your                                 objectives what are you trying to                                 accomplish                                 by doing what you're doing so in sun's                                 example uh you know why open source                                 java what are you trying to do uh                                 you know whether the developer community                                 likes                                 your answers or not it's very very                                 important to put it all out there on the                                 table to explain what it is you're doing                                 because the one thing that developers                                 won't forgive                                 is uh lies                                 spin all the things that marketing                                 people often will                                 will do to try to adjust how people                                 perceive a company                                 developers really just push back at that                                 and say forget it                                 we're just we're just not into that so                                 if developers see that you're on their                                 side that you're really trying to put it                                 all out there                                 they can sometimes cut you some slack                                 even if they don't like                                 your strategy completely next slide                                 okay so here's a few more questions do i                                 have to answer the hard questions too                                 absolutely you must answer in fact                                 that's the most important thing because                                 adoption-led strategies are not new                                 developers know where the traps are                                 developers know                                 where the problems can crop up and they                                 expect you to answer those questions                                 if you don't answer the questions it's                                 like a red flag they're trying to hide                                 something                                 if you do answer the questions and you                                 answer them intelligently                                 and with depth then developers know that                                 you know even if they don't agree with                                 you                                 that you you know what you're doing well                                 what if we don't know                                 the answers well how about that                                 transparency thing                                 just say we don't know that works very                                 well                                 and especially if you then come back and                                 and uh answer the questions later                                 when you do know well what if they don't                                 like the answers                                 well the truth is what's going to earn                                 you                                 the respect and trust to allow you                                 to have a strategy that may not                                 completely                                 solve all of the uh the problems that                                 the community                                 is looking to solve you may have some                                 goals and objectives that the community                                 just isn't interested in                                 or doesn't even agree with but if your                                 method for doing this uh this uh                                 uh initiative matches up                                 with their uh uh needs and objectives                                 sometimes you can                                 uh live together in the same community                                 go ahead simon                                 uh one thing to to emphasize here                                 is uh well actually there's two things                                 to emphasize first of all the faq                                 isn't a static document it's not                                 something you write once and forget                                 it's a document that you constantly                                 update as you learn                                 more and that where it's the way you                                 communicate                                 uh to the whole community but also to                                 your whole internal team                                 second thing to point out is that the                                 faq is not necessarily about                                 you the great source of wisdom and                                 knowledge telling the poor                                 uneducated and unwashed outsiders what                                 the truth is                                 this process is very much about you                                 discovering how others see you                                 it's very much about you discovering                                 what the flaws of your strategy are once                                 you've embarked on it                                 it's about you discovering the truth                                 yourself not just you telling truth to                                 others                                 and as a consequence the faq                                 used in the way that we're describing                                 here can prove to be very challenging it                                 can lead you into places in discussion                                 with your internal staff where you have                                 big arguments                                 as you discover that that you're doing                                 things wrong and you've got to change                                 things because that                                 question that you're answering                                 demonstrates that no you can't                                 um you know we can't use the gpl in that                                 way with that licensing exception                                 because it will disrupt our business                                 model and you only discover that in the                                 discussion that arises from                                 talking through the faq it                                 it's very much a learning journey that                                 you're on as you do an faq                                 rick yeah and one of one of the things                                 that can happen is you actually                                 uh go through the process and you                                 discover that                                 um that developers just aren't going to                                 adopt your                                 your technology if you follow the                                 strategy that you have in mind                                 so then you have a choice change the                                 strategy                                 or don't change the strategy and don't                                 use an adoption-led developer-led                                 a model for for uh for success                                 so you've got choices but at least you                                 won't be surprised                                 and the community won't be surprised                                 next slide                                 so let's look at an example so this is                                 from the open source java faq                                 and so uh the question is why didn't you                                 choose a license like bsd or apache                                 well guess what that's actually a really                                 hard question                                 and the reason why it's hard uh is is                                 kind of involved but                                 there were at the time there were                                 actually there were two                                 there were actually three different                                 editions of java micro edition                                 standard edition and enterprise edition                                 and                                 the micro edition is what ran on phones                                 and uh                                 and uh small devices and the standard                                 edition is what                                 underlie the uh server stuff as well as                                 the desktop stuff                                 and so um uh we actually did two                                 different licenses we did the                                 straight gpl for the micro edition and                                 we did the gpl with                                 the class pap exception which is kind of                                 like lgpl                                 for standard edition well why did we do                                 that                                 well we wanted to drive more adoption                                 of java standard edition especially                                 within                                 linux distributions and so how did we                                 do that we picked the license that                                 matched up with linux's license                                 and um we uh we offered that                                 uh out to uh to uh linux distributions                                 uh this um a lot                                 but with with the straight gpl for the                                 micro edition                                 it minimized the likelihood that we were                                 going to have                                 incompatible forks so the the value                                 proposition for java                                 right once run anywhere uh really                                 relied on api level compatibility across                                 all the different implementations of                                 java                                 and we were really trying to stop uh                                 things from                                 uh from forking we wanted to get a lot                                 of different uh                                 uh elements of the open source world uh                                 uh engaged and involved and contributing                                 and we want but you know the the final                                 the                                 thing that was probably most important                                 to sons executives                                 was to protect and uh enhance the                                 uh binary licensing uh business                                 so some made a ton of money on java                                 and they made it primarily through                                 binary licensing so                                 we had this this very difficult                                 uh uh push and pull between wanting to                                 engage the community                                 and wanting to maintain a binary oem                                 licensing model                                 and so we saw we solved it with this                                 sort of hybrid                                 licensing strategy that really didn't                                 please anybody in fact when you look at                                 android android uh came out with uh                                 uh class libraries that were licensed                                 under uh                                 what what did they license it with was                                 it apache yeah                                 yeah it was apache and so and that was                                 because                                 they knew that that um you know all                                 those phone manufacturers                                 they all wanted to be able to uh                                 mix their proprietary                                 cellular modems and everything else with                                 the open stuff                                 and not have to publish the source code                                 for it and it was kind of a non-starter                                 for                                 for them unless they bought a binary                                 license from sun                                 and that's why sun did did what they did                                 you want to                                 add anything to that simon no no go go                                 carry on                                 okay okay so next slide

all hangs together as a                                 sensible                                 overall strategy you can have a separate                                 faq for your technical

it's got to                                 be somebody                                 who uh is bridging the worlds of                                 technical and business uh so it can't                                 just be your uh your project lead it                                 can't                                 just be your uh a product owner in the                                 business it needs to be somebody who                                 is able to sit between those two worlds                                 uh someone who's really good with words                                 and can craft                                 very carefully sprung text that that                                 tells the truth in a concise and                                 compelling way                                 you've got to have somebody who can                                 resolve conflicts and to                                 bring people together and you've got to                                 have somebody who understands developers                                 and can                                 engage the developer community and and                                 uh                                 get trust from them and the obvious                                 person to do that is the person that                                 you've employed to be the community                                 manager                                 for the project that's involved you                                 could do it with a centralized person                                 from an                                 ospo the the only challenge with doing                                 that is that person                                 won't be completely uh                                 aware of all of the issues with the                                 product strategy direction and business                                 plan                                 in our case it was rick rich was the                                 perfect guy to do this                                 um he's he's uh uh                                 aware of all the issues he is a                                 conciliator and a brick builder                                 uh he uh it sees conflict as an                                 opportunity to build                                 agreement and move on to the next step                                 and uh so he did a great job and                                 congratulations rich                                 it was really i think we got java                                 launched basically because you were on                                 board                                 although everybody else on the team                                 thought it was them as well so um                                 there's you know that's                                 a that's a small benefit for you                                 um the other thing to to recognize is                                 that it's really important to have                                 the leadership of the company or at very                                 least the overall leadership responsible                                 for your product on board for this                                 strategy                                 because this strategy is going to create                                 conflict in the company                                 it is going to force you to face uh the                                 way your community sees you honestly                                 it is going to force you to admit what                                 your true motivations and objectives are                                 openly to your team as well as probably                                 to the public                                 though that your your leadership team is                                 going to have to be willing to make                                 compromises to handle hard questions                                 otherwise you're just going to raise all                                 the questions from the community                                 and you will craft for yourself the                                 weapons that are used to kill you                                 if you if you embrace this process then                                 you will probably need to agree to                                 surrender a little of your control of                                 the product to the process itself                                 this is really hard if you're a c-level                                 executive                                 you expect to call the shots you don't                                 expect to have the community or your                                 staff call the shots                                 but if you want to succeed with uh                                 getting your                                 open source software adopted for your                                 business benefit                                 you're going to have to get on board and                                 agree with all of these things                                 um the other channel oh rich carry on                                 yeah i just wanted to                                 to mention uh changing incentives it's                                 that                                 little bullet in the middle that's one                                 of the toughest ones                                 because if you've got a product that                                 you've been making a ton of money on                                 and all of a sudden the source code to                                 that product is out there for anyone to                                 use                                 to fork to do whatever they want with um                                 well what's what are the oem sales reps                                 going to do                                 when they can't buy their next mercedes                                 because                                 uh the uh the the uh                                 the oem sales business is drying up uh                                 well                                 you you need to figure out how you're                                 going to deal with that in your company                                 you need to figure out how you're going                                 to tell your investors                                 how you're going to continue to make                                 money uh with                                 uh an entirely new strategy i think                                 incentives are a really                                 crucial uh element okay                                 we're gonna need to skip on because                                 we're we're almost out of time here so                                 we might actually skip over some slides                                 um one big challenge you're going to                                 face is that your legal department will                                 tell you that speaking openly and                                 honestly about your motivations your                                 product                                 is too risky and i just want to confirm                                 for you that it is really                                 really risky um i had to appear in court                                 as a witness in the google oracle trial                                 and i found that uh that oracle                                 um made me do a video deposition and                                 brought up our email correspondence from                                 the process of doing this                                 faq as questions during that deposition                                 that was                                                and also the decisions we made about                                 open sourcing java during this process                                 became key elements in the java oracle                                 trial                                                                                                   materials we used in discussing it were                                 produced                                 by both parties by google and oracle as                                 evidenced during                                 that trial so it legal are right this is                                 a risky thing to do and                                 it may well be that that risk is too big                                 for your team to be willing to take on                                 there's no sense in which writing an faq                                 explaining your project                                 is a trivial casual thing to set about                                 doing                                 um uh rich                                 do you want to talk about this we've got                                 about two more so so at the                                           just before we uh                                 open sourced did the code drop for open                                 jdk                                 one of the senior executives at sun                                 tried to stage a coup                                 uh basically said you know i've never                                 really been on board with this whole                                 uh transparency thing let's just get rid                                 of that faq and do a really simple small                                 one                                 uh and uh this i think illustrates why                                 having your leadership on board is so                                 important uh because uh you know there                                 were some people who agreed with that                                 executive                                 but by then the engineering executives                                 who really uh ran the show at sun                                 were pretty well sold on uh transparency                                 and uh they pushed back but it took a                                 few of us um                                 having to threaten to quit in protest in                                 order to get                                 that faq published so you've got to                                 really be sure                                 your leadership has your back                                 next slide                                 [Music]                                 okay where are we oh i                                 could probably skip over that rich yeah                                 let's skip over this one                                 so other marketing and communications um                                 so                                 uh this is one of the the side benefits                                 of the faq                                 you've actually done most of the                                 marketing work with that faq it's a                                 source material for all the rest of your                                 your marketing materials uh speakers                                 guides keynotes etc                                 so when all of the questions have clear                                 and true answers                                 and you can just point people at them                                 you save a lot of time and effort                                 next okay so um                                 oh that's another one of yours uh you're                                 going backwards                                 well i went backwards i'm that's getting                                 getting spooked here                                 so did it all work well uh you'll                                 remember                                 back at the beginning of this process um                                 the                                 one of the challenges we faced was that                                 richard stallman had written an article                                 uh that uh called the java trap that                                 utterly condemned us in the                                 most corrupt skating and a plain way                                 which only richard is able to master                                 and at the end of that process um we got                                 to uh to this                                 the gnu general public license is the                                 most popular most widely used free                                 software license                                 the special thing about this license is                                 that it's a copyleft license                                 that is to say all versions of the                                 program must carry the same license                                 so the freedoms that the new gpl gives                                 to the users                                 must reach all the users of the program                                 and that's the purpose for which i wrote                                 it                                 it'll be very good that the java trap                                 won't exist anymore it'll be a thing of                                 the past                                 that kind of problem can still exist in                                 other areas but it won't exist for java                                 anymore                                 i think sun has will                                 with this contribution have contributed                                 more than any other company                                 to the free software community in the                                 form of software                                 and it shows leadership it's an example                                 i hope others will follow                                 [Music]                                 um so the output of this was uh we                                 actually did persuade richard stallman                                 to write to                                 record a promotional video for sun um                                 promoting uh open source java um which                                 um really was beyond our expectations at                                 the time i think it's fair to say rich                                 yeah it's pretty remarkable uh you know                                 richard stallman uh uh                                 didn't change his mind all that often                                 yeah uh                                 we we uh we solved uh we got him to                                 change his mind                                 by being completely transparent                                 about what we were doing and why we were                                 doing it all right                                 so we're pretty much out of time here uh                                 if you look at the rest of the slides                                 um uh you'll find a how-to                                 in how to do the faq and                                 both rich and i will be very pleased to                                 work with you on preparing this strategy                                 if you wish                                 it is a big undertaking and you need to                                 have your management lined up carefully                                 and you need to make sure that you are                                 as authentic as possible                                 because ultimately authenticity is the                                 key to using an faq to manage that                                 corporate community boundary                                 uh telling the truth and making it clear                                 that you are indeed                                 telling the truth and taking the                                 questions seriously is ultimately the                                 key                                 to your being successfully accepted rich                                 has written                                 uh as you would expect the mother of all                                 faqs                                 about writing the mother of all faqs and                                 there's a link                                 to his resources just there and a number                                 of other resources are available                                 and apart from that please do feel free                                 to
