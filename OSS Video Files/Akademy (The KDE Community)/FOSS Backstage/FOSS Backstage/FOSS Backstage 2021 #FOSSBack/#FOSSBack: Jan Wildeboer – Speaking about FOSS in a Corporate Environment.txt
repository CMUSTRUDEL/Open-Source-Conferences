	                              my name is                               jan wildebore i work at uh red hat as                               emi                               evangelist since uh                                                  just wanted to give you                               uh or share my my sort of elevator pitch                               if you want to                               position free and open source software                               in any corporate environment or also in                                public environments it doesn't really                                matter when people ask the question                                you know why should we care about this                                and if specifically if you want to                                um encourage them to allow people to                                share                                with other people because that's always                                the point a lot of companies say like oh                                my god corporate secrets we have to be                                very careful                                so my shortest version is                                effectively this um when you think about                                the world we live in today                                then a few things have changed compared                                to maybe                                             the biggest change that we are                                experiencing is                                that hardware has become more or less                                irrelevant and everything                                everything now more or less happens on                                the software layer                                and when you work on the software layer                                you know you need to have this kind of                                of abstraction                                to even think about stuff like cloud or                                devops or all of this stuff so                                the software layer defines everything                                nowadays software defined networking                                software defined storage etc and when                                you look at                                a typical it stack in this modern world                                which is you know                                this size this is your i.t stack                                then this is where things get                                interesting and this is what i always                                point out                                if you are a company and you know you're                                in a market and you're competing with                                other companies then                                this it stack in your vertical typically                                tends to be                                quite comparable to your direct                                competition because you work on the same                                laws the same regulations                                so you tend to have a lot of parts                                working in the same way                                and if you take a closer look and this                                is what always you know gives                                people this this surprise moment when we                                take a closer look                                then we see that maybe you know                                      on top of this whole stack is stuff                                where you actually make                                money that is your secret sauce that is                                the stuff that sets you apart from the                                rest the stuff that you need to hide and                                keep secret                                but that means logically very simply                                that                                                         in your mostly software-driven it stack                                actually is non-competitive                                functionality it is stuff that                                does not add to your margin it's just                                stuff                                that you need in the broader sense and                                that is exactly                                where open source and free software                                kicks in because we built that                                   so that you can focus on that                                   from a company organization perspective                                this also means                                should i really focus all my money on                                the                                                                  it's only the                                   that i really should care about and                                doesn't it make far more sense to reach                                out                                to your direct competition even to work                                together on that                                                        can get four companies to work together                                on                                whatever part in that eighty percent our                                respective investment risk just dropped                                by                                           because we are now sharing this stuff                                and it's non-competitive so we're not                                giving anything away                                with this argument with this                                      distribution of                                looking at stacks it's a very general                                 principle it's a pareto principle and                                 you know it's it's it's nothing special                                 but it helps in positioning what open                                 source really means in i.t                                 it's not necessarily the fancy cool                                 whatever                                 stuff because that's not what open                                 source works on open source works on the                                 stuff that everybody needs ideally                                 that can be shared freely as freely as                                 possible                                 and that adds to that eighty percent                                 that we all need to build working stacks                                 now you can call this                                 openstack you can call this kubernetes                                 or whatever                                 ultimately all of these projects are                                 working on the same thing                                 standardize the hell out of the lower                                 eighty percent and work together on that                                 in a non-competitive way                                 i guess i'm almost perfectly on time i                                 still have                                                                                                     think about this as a way to position                                 what we are doing in the world of open                                 source and free software                                 how this explains a lot of things in a                                 very simple way that makes it                                 understandable to people who are not                                 really deep into this if you have any                                 questions you can meet me later on in                                 the spatial lounge                                 or you can ask them right here thank you                                 you
