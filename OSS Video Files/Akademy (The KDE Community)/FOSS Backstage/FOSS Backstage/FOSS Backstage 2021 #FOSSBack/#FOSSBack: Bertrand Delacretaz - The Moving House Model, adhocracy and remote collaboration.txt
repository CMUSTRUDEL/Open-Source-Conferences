Title: #FOSSBack: Bertrand Delacretaz - The Moving House Model, adhocracy and remote collaboration
Publication date: 2021-02-25
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Moving house with the help of a group of friends is an interesting exercise in collective improvisation and coordination. Everybody can help with most of the jobs at hand, so the challenge is to keep people busy in a meaningful way, to make the best use of the physical and intellectual resources available, while keeping people happy and engaged.

Sounds familiar? The Moving House model does apply to other types of group projects, including software development. Adhocracy, Asynchronous Collaboration and a can-do attitude, as practiced in Open Source communities, are key elements that enable groups that have no formal structure to collaborate efficiently and smoothly - like when helping friends moving house.

In times where remote collaboration is more important than ever, we'll dig into the analogies between a simple group activity, such as moving lots of stuff from one place to another, and more complex projects. This will help us discover how to turn team members into "autonomous agents" with just the right amount of group coordination to make things happen.


This talk will help both managers and group members better understand how to collaborate remotely, and how to avoid the trap of "reproducing office life remotely" that is too common with remote collaboration in Covid-19 times.

	                              so yeah yeah                               might be surprised to see me in black                               and white and slice on black and white                               as well i thought                               you know it's a it's a low tech uh thing                               that i'm taking as an example so why not                               look low tech and                               it you know shows my age as well so i                               think it's probably useful                                um so yeah i'm i work for adobe in                                attached administratively attached to                                the basel office nobody's going to the                                basel office currently as you can                                imagine                                so but i've been working remotely                                forever i would say for a very long time                                at least um almost i would say                                         probably                                so and i've been studying these things                                you might have seen some of my other                                talks on the topic so this one is a                                brand new one you're being treated to                                the beta version                                of this of this talk about moving house                                um i don't know how it works it's                                probably different in different cultures                                but in                                in switzerland where i live it's very                                common when you move house to ask                                friends to come and help you know you                                gather a team of friends                                and you improvise the thing and and it                                tends to work pretty well and i i've                                done that a number of times obviously                                and um i thought                                there's many parallels between                                successfully                                organizing a moving day usually we do                                that on one day you know                                we prepare then the friends come for                                just one day and then you make a big                                effort and you move the whole stuff                                and i realized that organizing this                                successfully                                that there's lots of parallels between                                that and the asynchronous collaboration                                that we need to do now                                especially with these times of covid                                if i can switch my slides yes so there i                                think there are many parallels between                                these activities and that's what we're                                going to                                to discuss in this talk                                first obviously you need to make the                                decision to move                                and it's a big decision you know any                                change that you take                                you have to you make implies some risk                                way where you are is                                often you're okay you think okay maybe                                the new thing is better                                but there's going to be things that are                                not as good or initially not as good and                                you need to work on them                                so it's uh you know first you d you make                                need to                                make the decision and the parallel with                                our                                collaboration or software projects is                                that you need to define the project's                                vision                                where is it that we're going in the                                moving house case if people bring your                                furniture to the wrong place it's not                                very useful                                so this is with moving is pretty useful                                it's pretty easy you know you define                                where you go                                but still you need to to have a very                                clear vision of your project                                when is it going to happen how are you                                going to set it up so this is the                                equivalent of                                clearly defining the project's vision                                and then um                                you might be a bit afraid this is this                                looks a bit like one                                of our moves so i have a family with uh                                three kids                                and i've been because i've been working                                home we had the office                                i had the office at home and stuff and                                on one of our moves we had                                    of these boxes to move our stuff                                and that that's a bit scary when you                                think about it it's a lot of work so you                                know                                but no guts no glory you have to go go                                for it                                 and take some risks and make some effort                                 and uh                                 you know and you hope you'll be                                 successful and you                                 you do what it takes to be successful                                 you don't just hope                                 so there's also lots of similarities                                 here between                                 embracing projects that might be might                                 seem a bit                                 too big or too complicated or just you                                 know just above the level                                 where you're comfortable and that's                                 there's lots of rewards                                 associated to that so then once you have                                 decided that you want to move once you                                 have                                 overcome the fear of doing it you need                                 to prepare                                 and the anticipation preparation                                 preparation is a                                 is a big part of being successful                                 exactly as in the software project                                 need to think you know how are things                                 going to happen maybe mentally go                                 through the steps and you know are we                                 going to have the right things when we                                 arrive at the new place and stuff                                 so before your team starts working you                                 need to to be serious about the the                                 preparation that                                 that you'll be doing so for                                 for your move you will invite friends                                 and actually                                 you invite the right friends you know                                 you know you know you folks know your                                 friends you know                                 some people talk a lot and they don't do                                 much                                 others might not be in a good shape to                                 do a move you know if                                 they have a you know back problems or                                 yeah it might maybe they would they want                                 to come and help you                                 in a different way come clean up the old                                 flat after you move or                                 there's many other things you can do but                                 for this big day                                 you need the right team and assembling                                 the right team is very                                 important exactly as in a software                                 project you know                                 in open source it's cool because there's                                 this self selection usually                                 people start being useful and then you                                 realize that they are adding value to                                 the project                                 and you you integrate them in your                                 project in this case you have to in                                 advance                                 select the right people but because they                                 are your friends you know them so                                 you can you know you can assemble                                 hopefully the right team                                 being careful to have the right mix of                                 people in your on your team                                 right number as well                                 another part of the preparation that we                                 all love                                 when we're moving is to put things in                                 boxes hopefully your boxes are a bit                                 smaller than these                                 than the ones we see here on the picture                                 and it's actually very important to have                                 the right size of boxes you know                                 if your boxes has two are too big or too                                 heavy                                 that the one person cannot carry them                                 it's much less convenient to organize                                 the stuff so we                                 will have some big things to move maybe                                 some larger furniture                                 but for the most part you want ideally                                 you want to have standardized                                 uh you know boxes in switzerland we                                 often use the banana                                 cardboard boxes that that the that the                                 stores use when received bananas and                                 sometimes they give them away so you can                                 get get them for free it's very                                 convenient                                 and if you have all boxes of the same                                 size or similar size                                 you know same size is very easy to put                                 in the in the truck when you're moving                                 your stuff                                 and the same weight or not going over a                                 certain weight is important so you don't                                 hurt your friends and they are                                 comfortable carrying them so it's a very                                 also very important planning                                 planning uh step in your in your move                                 and in the equivalent in software is                                 breaking your problem in smaller parts                                 you want to create a big software thing                                 or complicated complex software thing                                 we need to break that into smaller parts                                 of the right size and we usually use                                 tickets to do that in software                                 but the it's very much the same thing                                 you know breaking down your program                                 into small manageable parts                                 and you don't forget to label these                                 things if you                                 if you have ever ever done a move where                                 people didn't label the the boxes                                 it's a mess you know then you have to                                 ask maybe open the box to see what's in                                 it to find out where it goes in the new                                 flat that's not convenient at                                 all so you have to be very careful about                                 labeling thing here we have a great                                 example                                 where you know it's very obvious                                 sometimes you you have old cardboard                                 boxes from previous moves which have all                                 labor                                 so it's it's quickly messy so here i                                 think we have a good example                                 and the goal of this is to foster lose                                 coordination to foster                                 a kind of asynchronous coordination you                                 know on the day                                 everybody will be there but you want                                 your people to act as autonomous                                 autonomous agents                                 to be look at the box oh this is glasses                                 it's fragile it goes in the kitchen i                                 know what to do                                 you don't have to go and ask the who's                                 who you know the leader of the move                                 exactly what to do with this box it's                                 obvious and it's the same thing software                                 you want to                                 when you create your tickets for your                                 project or wiki pages that define                                 what to do you have to be careful about                                 how you label things                                 so that they can be people can be as                                 autonomous as possible in working on                                 that                                 that step of the project                                 okay so you have done your preparation                                 you think you're good                                 and then comes the big day you're up                                 early in the morning waiting for your                                 friends to show                                 up and you know enough planning now you                                 need to start doing that's that's when                                 it happens                                 still you have to be careful about                                 having the right elements                                 so that you you'll be successful um                                 i have the right tools you need some                                 tools maybe to disassemble some                                 furniture                                 there's always been some unknowns in the                                 new flat maybe something was not                                 set up properly and you need to fix                                 things to put your                                 your new furniture in place so you be                                 you're careful to                                 you know have the right set of tools                                 exactly as in software                                 uh my math teacher back in school used                                 to say                                 good craftsmen have good tools you know                                 to do a good job you need good tools and                                 that's important                                 and before your friends show up you                                 clean up all the sharp things you know                                 you                                 you've been preparing things in the flat                                 maybe disassembling some things already                                 there might be                                 loose nails on the floor you don't want                                 people to get hurt so you create a safe                                 space                                 for your team to operate exactly as we                                 as you do in software                                 you know in terms of uh people having                                 good workstations being                                 economic way to work                                 and you know being having friendly                                 atmosphere a positive atmosphere on the                                 team                                 exactly the same thing so the the                                 analogy with that is cleaning up the                                 floors                                 and making sure there's no dangerous                                 things around when your friend                                 when your friends come and uh and start                                 doing their work                                 and you provide food and beverages of                                 course this team will need to                                 to drink something to to have something                                 to eat during the day so they can stay                                 productive you know and efficient and                                 there's many different tastes                                 if you have a diverse group you need a                                 diverse set of food                                 so that everybody everybody can stay                                 happy and healthy                                 during your your big moving day the                                 analogy                                 in software is to create a productive                                 and sustainable environment to make sure                                 you know your co-workers are fed                                 intellectually and practically and you                                 know physically and everything                                 so it's uh that's the analogies i see                                 here                                 in the food that you provide for your                                 friends compared to providing a                                 productive sustainable environment for                                 your                                 for your software team                                 and you share the plan when your friends                                 arrive it's very important to orient                                 them                                 to explain them how the thing is going                                 to work you know how you have organized                                 things how you have labeled the boxes                                 what you shouldn't do or what you should                                 be careful of you know these                                 these are the boxes which are fragile                                 they have red labels be careful with                                 these or don't put them in a big truck                                 we'll put them in a small car                                 to to be more careful about them and so                                 on there's many things                                 that for you might be obvious but for                                 your friends maybe they                                 they did different moves with different                                 people and they have different ideas of                                 how                                 how this should go so you have to to                                 explain                                 you know what's your vision of how                                 things are going to go                                 how to find information and make sure                                 everybody has the same information                                 that's a problem that i see often in                                 software projects                                 where everybody has a different piece of                                 the information                                 and and they don't have the overview and                                 it can be very hard then to coordinate                                 especially if you have to do this                                 asynchronously                                 so sharing the plan here we do it you                                 know speaking to your friends                                 but it can also be in written form                                 there's many many ways of                                 doing that and then it starts                                 people start moving things you know you                                 can uh                                 at some point you have to stop talking                                 and start doing                                 and maybe when your friends arrive                                 someone has a great idea yeah i think we                                 should do it like that or maybe we                                 should think about a better way to go                                 to the other place you know better road                                 or something                                 it's good but at some point you okay now                                 it's                                                                   to get going                                 so yeah same thing in software if you                                 talk for too long you will go nowhere so                                 at some point you have to decide okay                                 we think we have enough information to                                 get started so let's actually get                                 starting and get started and start                                 carrying                                 stuff and                                 you probably have some specialists in                                 your friends maybe you have someone                                 who's a carpenter                                 who's you know used to assembling                                 furniture disassembling                                 being careful about that here we see                                 this uh these folks with white gloves                                 they're very careful about how they do                                 it so if you are someone who is                                 especially good at                                 doing something you want to put them in                                 that slot you know in that that task                                 that's where they'll be efficient                                 they'll be happy others might be happy                                 because they don't have to do that thing                                 that they don't really know how to do                                 it's the same thing sometimes there's a                                 illusion in software                                 and you know among software engineers                                 that people are interchangeable                                 that can be the case up to a point but                                 you know it's like or                                 if you do soccer you want to put people                                 on the right spot in the field                                 it's exactly the same thing try to take                                 advantage of everybody's                                 uh specific uh capabilities and and                                 skills                                 um on the other hand you still need to                                 be you know                                 somewhat interchangeable if one of these                                 guys is is sick on the day                                 someone will need to to sub for them and                                 you know take on their work                                 so you shouldn't be too um you know too                                 too                                 particular about okay this is my                                 specialty only do disassembling                                 assembling                                 uh furniture it's not good you have to                                 be flexible                                 while recognizing the special special                                 skills of people is                                 exactly the same in software once again                                 okay so you know you reach destination                                 i'm not saying anything on the the big                                 truck and driving it there's there'll                                 probably be a number of a number of                                 interesting things to say but let's                                 skip that and you know you reach the                                 destination                                 uh now you're ready to start putting                                 actually stuff in the new flat and                                 arranging everything so it's so it's                                 fine                                 and i think again you probably welcome                                 an orient people there so you'll                                 if you're leading the the move you'll be                                 there first and then you'll show people                                 around maybe we have them visit                                 the the flat the new flat quickly and                                 you explain them again how it's                                 things are set up here for example maybe                                 you put sheets on the doors to explain                                 what goes in this room or even what                                 what the name of this room is so that                                 people can match it to the labels                                 maybe in the rooms you have signs that                                 say here you should put                                 cardboard boxes which are still full                                 here's where the bed goes or maybe you                                 have a plan                                 you know you have your your vision of                                 how the flat should end up                                 and and uh and maybe you even did some                                 plans i don't know                                 but you have to communicate this vision                                 to the people and                                 here if you have a big team this is a                                 pretty big flat so may                                 you might have a big team to move uh you                                 probably need some written explanations                                 you know                                 if people have to come to you every time                                 they have a question oh where does this                                 box go                                 how do we put the couch you will waste a                                 lot of time communicating                                 and not actually doing work so                                 it can be very useful to have written                                 instructions that you                                 you will put in the right places in the                                 flat and it's exactly the same in                                 software you know                                 sometimes uh especially in large                                 organizations people                                 who do lots of meetings and they talk a                                 lot                                 it's good i mean i'm not saying you                                 shouldn't talk but                                 you the written form is extremely                                 efficient when you need to                                 help people to coordinate loosely or                                 asynchronously                                 and it's the same here in your flat                                 maybe some written instructions will                                 help people                                 figure out things without having to come                                 to you all the time and ask you                                 and then waste time in communicating                                 and you will check the food and                                 beverages again you know people                                 they have started to eat some stuff                                 there some things are missing                                 you will make sure that there's again                                 enough to keep people productive                                 and engaged and it's the same thing                                 again in software                                 uh you know creating a big software                                 project is more like a marathon it's                                 okay we work sometimes in sprints but i                                 think the whole project is a marathon so                                 you need                                 energy you need uh you know food for the                                 people be it in                                 intellectual food or you know physical                                 food                                 but in this case you need to make sure                                 there's enough enough                                 fuel i would say to keep the people                                 productive and engaged so we                                 you will do that several times during                                 the day probably                                 and you are here to help even if you                                 have written instructions                                 which is great uh there are some                                 detailed questions                                 that that people need to rely you know                                 they need to count on you for                                 so you'll be here you'll be available to                                 answer questions                                 but you want to restrict that to the                                 specific questions which are not covered                                 by the the                                 no the written instructions that that                                 you wrote and that's                                 it's an it's a you need to find the                                 right balance you don't want to spend                                 too much time doing tons of complicated                                 written instructions but you want to be                                 available for the                                 the harder or things that are harder to                                 explain or where you have a very                                 specific idea i want this thing exactly                                 here                                 and so you need to be around and you                                 need to be                                 to free up your time to be available to                                 help your team                                 it's the same way uh in a software team                                 you know this                                 serve service information is needed and                                 and                                 very useful but it it doesn't cannot do                                 everything you need to find                                 when do you switch to spoken one to one                                 or smaller team conversation                                 to make sure the information and the                                 vision is clearly                                 communicated so it's it's a difficult                                 balance to find in there especially                                 in a larger software project                                 okay so it's getting you know you're                                 getting there uh                                 you have moved most of the furniture but                                 then you know the end is very long                                 usually                                 uh that's you know things goes start to                                 slow down                                 and there's still a lot of small things                                 to do which are not maybe obvious                                 but need to be done for the for the job                                 to be finished it's not finished until                                 it is and                                 how do you decide that                                 one very important thing that i realized                                 when i when i go and help friends move                                 is that you have to be to to be doing                                 useful work                                 all the time often uh when you're                                 helping people move there's many things                                 you can do yes i can carry a box i can                                 maybe paint this door if it needs to be                                 painted or                                 i can reassemble this cupboard or things                                 like that                                 the trick if you want the team to be                                 efficient is that everybody                                 should always be doing something useful                                 maybe it's they're not what they thought                                 they would do                                 maybe they'll get a bit messy by by                                 doing you know the painting                                 um maybe they'll be tidy in the evening                                 but                                 you try to be useful all the time find a                                 slot where you can do something useful                                 it's the same in a software project if                                 especially if when you're in a crisis                                 uh you know that there's many things to                                 do and then you might need to                                 autonomously find                                 find something that you can do grab a                                 ticket work on it                                 implement it and and help you know do                                 provide concrete help to the project                                 that's like like the bees here which are                                 very autonomous                                 and they each do very small things but                                 together it creates something                                 much better or much larger i would say                                 and uh yeah i mentioned i don't had her                                 crassy                                 in the in the abstract of this talk and                                 i think it fits very well                                 in this context you know if you look in                                 wikipedia                                 uh this is the definite uh an excerpt of                                 the definition from wikipedia                                 it's defined by a lack of formal                                 structure of course when you're                                 moving house with with friends we don't                                 define a                                 you know a master of the cupboards on a                                 master of the boxes                                 it's all very loose and and there's no                                 no formal structure                                 and people have to be adaptive creative                                 and flexible                                 so so you know so it's efficient so                                 you're not arguing about who should do                                 what just do it                                 you know go i can do that i do it okay                                 done fine                                 and that's that's very similar to uh the                                 hawker a democracy                                 and the one thing that's if you look at                                 the adequacy definition                                 they say the cost of communication can                                 be very high                                 because you need to coordinate you need                                 you know you need all these                                 semi-autonomous agents they need to                                 coordinate for it to be to be efficient                                 and that's i think with what we defined                                 having a clear vision                                 having written form explanations that                                 people can use in search service                                 i think you can read drastically reduce                                 the cost                                 and that's what we see in open source                                 projects where                                 uh you know the cost of communications                                 it's uh                                 it's you know it's not a problem because                                 we're used to asynchronous communication                                 written communication and and i think                                 there's again many parallels here                                 okay so uh now it's really you know it's                                 really getting down your flat looks like                                 how you imagine it would more or less                                 you think you have                                 good enough conditions to spend the                                 night here and eat in the morning                                 so it's it's you know it's getting good                                 and it's important to decide                                 when to stop you know when is good                                 enough i'm not sure if this picture                                 would be good enough for all of us                                 but maybe you know if your flat still                                 looks like that but your bedroom is                                 ready                                 you can sleep the kitchen is good enough                                 so you can eat in the morning                                 you can take care of that later and good                                 enough might be different from one                                 person to the                                 to the other but it's very important to                                 define when it's good enough and you                                 don't want to                                 this to drag on and your friends to get                                 you know tired and angry oh this is                                 you know this is really uh lasting too                                 long it doesn't work                                 so you will have to define what is good                                 enough and                                 as in software nothing's ever                                     finished at some point you need to let                                 go and say okay                                 this good enough it it fulfills the                                 criteria                                 uh even if it's not perfect everywhere                                 and                                 we we can go on so again a strong                                 parallel here                                 and then you will have to invite people                                 to stop and some of them will not be                                 willing to stop they say no you know i                                 can still arrange this carpet                                 okay the painting here the you know the                                 painted door i can do another layer                                 or he said no no it's good enough we                                 stopped and now we have to celebrate                                 you know it's important as well when                                 you're finished                                 um you want you know you did                                 great things with your friends and you                                 have to celebrate and enjoy it maybe                                 someone's bringing pizza or some other                                 food                                 and and you have a good time you know                                 after all this hard work you need a                                 reward you need to                                 to rejoice together it's the same thing                                 in software teams you know when you                                 reach good milestones it's great to have                                 a celebration                                 uh whatever you can do in these days of                                 of covid and                                 physical distance but there's many cool                                 things that you can do and it's                                 important to                                 to do them                                 and in the end of you know at the end of                                 the day you are probably very tired                                 about all this preparation all this                                 coordination all this this work                                 and but you're very happy you know we                                 made it uh                                 it doesn't come for free it was a big                                 effort and you you put the effort in                                 you you did your best and you find ways                                 to make things work                                 and then you can be can be very happy                                 about it                                 and that's it you know it worked we                                 moved it's sometimes                                 if you looked at the pile of stuff that                                 you had to move                                 and you said by by myself it would be                                 impossible                                 but your friends showed up and you made                                 it and you organized it and you                                 coordinated                                 and if you do it in a way that people                                 can be autonomous agents more or less                                 it will be much more enjoyable and much                                 more efficient                                 so i think there are many parallels                                 between                                 moving house and creating software                                 projects hope these                                 simple principles can help you remember                                 what we can do                                 to make our software projects better and                                 more efficient and we see a lot of that                                 in the open source                                 communities you know that's uh many of                                 these techniques                                 and principles are in in everyday                                 you know they are applied in in open                                 source communities and                                 you know it also works in large                                 organizations companies whatever                                 you can really use the same principles                                 so i hope this                                 analogy has been interesting to you and                                 it you know it will                                 hopefully help you remember how to                                 structure                                 and organize your projects to be to be                                 more efficient                                 we have four minutes i think left for                                 questions                                 so uh um alexander if you have any                                 i'm happy to take them hey bertrand so                                 it's josh here i'm gonna                                 field any questions we're just waiting                                 for our job to come in                                 uh and uh kevin from the chat just                                 mentions uh                                 it's like minimum viable product as                                 applied to moving house                                 uh which seems yeah the analogy seems to                                 work it works for me as i'm listening to                                 this i can totally see it                                 um while we're waiting for questions                                 come in i actually have a quick                                 question myself where um i                                 i joined a distributed company so i work                                 for elastic i joined a distributed                                 company and what i noticed                                 coming from a normal company um was that                                 there really was a lot of                                 uh optimizing for uh these autonomous                                 agents                                 and you talk a lot about the balance                                 between you know making sure that                                 there's there's still a team and there's                                 team support                                 i'm wondering if you have any tips for                                 what's a good way to find that balance                                 to not have                                 you know people working at home or in                                 their corner alone completely alone and                                 isolated from the team                                 versus what you may find in a more                                 traditional                                 in in situ team where everything is                                 actually optimized for                                 team function and and kind of group                                 think what are some ways that you found                                 that can                                 you can strike a good balance between                                 these two                                 so i think a nice way of of you know                                 i think the way we we like to work when                                 we're doing creative work is as a team                                 you know i love the brainstorming                                 sessions when you're all                                 in the same room and you have white                                 boards and you you collaborate with that                                 uh it's very hard to do in a in a purely                                 remote setting                                 i think the nice way is to alternate                                 between periods where okay                                 okay you're at home you're you know you                                 can organize as                                 uh how however you want you're working                                 alone or maybe in teams of                                 two or three on your stuff and then a                                 phase is when you                                 get together with a larger team and                                 there's many ways to organize like                                 virtual hackathons today                                 we did that in my my team in my company                                 a few few weeks ago                                 where we everybody would work would work                                 in their corner but we had                                 two short meetings morning and afternoon                                 and so beginning                                 and end of the day to come together and                                 one someone will explain what they've                                 been doing                                 demonstrate and that so i think it made                                 for a good balance of                                 being quiet on your own and efficient                                 and then having some social interaction                                 some social aspect                                 one fun thing that we did was um                                 each team had to find a name for their                                 team on                                 on one of the days in these daily uh                                 short meetings                                 we had to wear something that that                                 matches that matches the name of your                                 team                                 so we were my team we were the mad                                 hatters so we were wearing crazy hats                                 for this meeting and it                                 you know it reproduce a bit of the of                                 the social interaction but i think                                 alternating between                                 alone time and group time as much as we                                 can uh                                 can help for that yeah that makes a lot                                 of sense that really strikes a chord                                 with me being an introvert as i think                                 many distributed workers are                                 it's nice to have that mix of the two of                                 them                                 so somebody uh on the chat asks um                                 this question from malvika uh what                                 happens when this group of friends do                                 this kind of move on a regular basis can                                 they build a                                 government governance structure of                                 decision making                                 well that's an interesting question so i                                 never had the same groups of friends                                 twice so they are they're always                                 different and i think that that's that's                                 a big advantage of that and maybe we                                 need to reproduce that in our teams                                 if you if you have always the same team                                 things tend to solidify and then                                 you know exactly how the other one is                                 going to react and make things sometimes                                 harder                                 so i think it's good to have some                                 rotation on maybe or maybe if you do                                 these workshops that we're discussing                                 if i invite someone who's totally                                 strange you know you know who's a total                                 stranger to your team                                 and and i think they can bring some                                 fresh ideas                                 that's what i see when moving houses yes                                 no                                 some even someone who can be active you                                 know help okay                                 they have to know a bit of the                                 techniques but maybe from different                                 group or different culture                                 so so no mixed thing up mix things up i                                 would say                                 you
