Title: #FOSSBackstage: Russ Rutledge - Opt-in InnerSource at Scale
Publication date: 2021-03-02
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	InnerSource is a fantastic way to collaborate and produce software. Join Russ Rutledge, Director of Community and InnerSource at Nike, as he explores how Nike’s culture of “Just Do It” impacts their approach to InnerSource. Russ will share their collaboration maturity model that gives a “glide path” towards InnerSource and the rules they use to introduce and incentivise new behaviours for broad adoption.

	                              hey everyone                               really glad to be with you here today                               i'm so glad for the introduction that uh                               daniel gave to                               inner source uh especially uh to his                               emphasis                               on starting with people and culture                               first                               so i'm going to talk about efforts that                                we've had at nike and getting people to                                opt in to intersource                                behavior at scale across the company so                                my role at nike is i am the director of                                developer                                of developer collaboration so our goal                                is to                                make it easy for ad hoc scaled                                peer-to-peer                                interaction and collaboration to happen                                across the company                                we think our agile org does a very good                                job within a particular                                business train within a particular                                product at organizing development                                but we have needs that span across                                multiple release trains                                multiple business units where the same                                problems keep popping up over and over                                again                                and there's no dedicated team that's                                going to solve those for everyone                                so without some broad system for                                developers collaborating together                                people are going to be stuck solving the                                same problems over and over again                                within their organizational silos uh                                there's one example of this                                a lot of teams at the company use                                kubernetes and containers                                to manage their deployed solutions there                                are certain uh                                challenges and things that teams need to                                figure out about running kubernetes                                successfully                                in one of the cloud providers that nike                                uses                                we don't want that to be figured out                                over and over again but we'd like to                                make it very easy for engineers to come                                together                                to share ideas best practices and                                working code and solutions                                all across the company so that's the the                                goal of my                                my team is to enable that for all types                                of shared problems                                problems that happen and we see inner                                source as                                one of the highest most skilled most                                mature ways                                that we can enable that kind of                                knowledge sharing so what i'm gonna do                                is talk about how we                                evangelize those practices within the                                culture that we have at nike                                which is very much a culture of just do                                it                                so at nike this is more than a marketing                                slogan that we                                share with athletes and consumers inside                                the company is also                                permeates the way that software                                development happens software teams are                                largely free to choose their own tooling                                to choose their own development                                processes                                which is both a blessing and then a                                challenge in getting folks to                                adopt intersource way of working at                                scale on the one hand                                teams are free to engage in inner source                                software                                to work together to collaborate but then                                on the other hand there's no kind of                                overarching guiding structure that we                                can enforce from above to to make sure                                it happens                                so what we've had to do is we've had to                                learn a lot about people and culture                                just as much or more than inner source                                in order to get this to be successful                                so we've learned how to tap into the                                inborn motivations that people                                have already have and then to direct                                those toward an inner source                                way of working we've learned about                                social change                                about culture and group dynamics and how                                they worked and learned how to position                                 inner source and the way we train people                                 on innosource to tap into those                                 natural motivators and natural lines of                                 up leveling that people already have                                 with this approach myself and the small                                 team that i work with                                 have been able to have a very big effect                                 at enabling collaboration inner sorts at                                 scale                                 even without organizational authority or                                 hierarchy                                 in order to do so so let me explain how                                 that works                                 what we found is that inner source is                                 just one behavior                                 on a broad continuum or a maturity model                                 of collaborative behavior                                 and what i'm going to share with you is                                 three dimensions of collaborative                                 behavior                                 on which we can plot inner source                                 there's more dimensions                                 than this but these are just the three                                 key ones                                 and all of these dimensions that i'll                                 explain to you refer to the way that a                                 person or a team                                 interacts or collaborates on some shared                                 solution with others that are not on                                 their same scrum team                                 not a part of their same agile agile org                                 something saying i think it'll become                                 clear as i                                 give some examples so one dimension or                                 aspect of how people collaborate                                 is what we call the artifact that people                                 collaborate on                                 and our idea with inner source is that                                 people are going to collaborate on code                                 they're going to collaborate                                 on working solutions i gave the example                                 of                                 a kubernetes before may there's some                                 shared way of managing                                 clusters of kubernetes or shared                                 shared containers in the cloud at nike                                 where we can bottle up solutions and                                 as code and contribute in an inner                                 source fashion that's what we want                                 people to do that's the ideal                                 another dimension of our aspect of                                 maturity                                 and how people collaborate together is                                 what we call the criticality of the                                 thing                                 they're collaborating on and our ideal                                 is that people are unblocked                                 in their mainline daily work through                                 inner source                                 when i have a problem that's on my                                 roadmap and there's some something i                                 need                                 some dependency that needs to be updated                                 that i as an engineer                                 at the company feel enabled to go and                                 contribute that to the solution to the                                 the project or product wherever that                                 made to be and that's the ideal                                 uh the last dimension it will cause                                 organizationally with whom do i feel                                 enabled to collaborate                                 this way and our ideal is that anyone at                                 the company                                 is my collaborative partner uh in in                                 some sort of                                 inner source solution so this is the                                 ideal this is where we want to achieve                                 this is where                                 we work to get to every day but we find                                 that that's                                 uh actually very difficult it requires                                 a lot of skill to have people take their                                 main line daily                                 coding and get it done with anyone else                                 across the company                                 there's a lot of shared culture a lot of                                 shared mindset that needs to happen to                                 get there                                 and it's difficult for people to jump                                 all the way in for them to jump                                 all the way to the right on this                                 maturity model and so                                 we've identified mostly through                                 observation behaviors that                                 are a little further to the left on the                                 model a little easier to engage in                                 require a little less skill a little                                 more entry level but nonetheless                                 our point of preparation for behaviors                                 that are further on the right you know                                 where we'd like to see kind of toward                                 full inner source                                 uh furthermore we see if we can get                                 people engaging further to the left                                 they'll start naturally up leveling                                 themselves along these three dimensions                                 until we get closer and closer to that                                 right most behavior that we want to see                                 so these dimensions this maturity model                                 isn't something that we made up it's                                 something that we've                                 observed that we saw happening and as                                 we've articulated it and begin to use it                                 and intentionally try                                 to up level people along these three                                 dimensions of maturity                                 uh it yields a very a very easy up                                 leveling it's very natural for people                                 and this is played out all around the                                 company and as i've shared this at                                 conferences like this one                                 it's rung true for others as well so we                                 believe it to be true and it's been very                                 useful for us                                 so let's let's go ahead and talk then                                 about some of these                                 preparatory points of maturity that                                 allow us to up level folks gradually                                 toward the right first of all on that                                 top dimension                                 which is the artifact that people                                 produce when they're collaborating                                 and we'd love for code and working                                 solutions to be collaborated everywhere                                 on everywhere but further to the left                                 one way people can start                                 is to just get them talking with people                                 that are on their team                                 sharing ideas is a powerful way to get                                 started and it makes sense it's very                                 difficult                                 to have the idea that i'm going to code                                 a solution with someone if i don't even                                 have a habit of talking                                 so one example the thing that we do here                                 is in addition to enabling inner source                                 my group the company enables a broad                                 robust                                 series of open community meetups                                 happening inside the company                                 every week there are now hundreds of                                 engineers that come together                                 to talk and to collaborate on all kinds                                 of shared uh                                 shared concerns share tech technologies                                 in the example i gave her earlier                                 there's a kubernetes group that meets                                 together just to share best practices                                 gotchas that they're finding there are                                 similar groups that do so around other                                 shared concerns like                                 accessibility or or observability we                                 find that                                 this is a common entry point that can                                 get a lot of people thinking in a                                 collaborative mindset                                 that get them thinking that it's okay                                 for me to work with and to get good                                 ideas from other folks and that gets                                 them ready for code collaboration                                 later on now as a as a midpoint                                 between talking with other people and                                 coding with them                                 we also find it useful to encourage                                 people to co-produce                                 pieces of writing or documentation this                                 can look like                                 if if contributing code to a project is                                 too much maybe somebody can                                 contribute an update to the user                                 documentation uh some of our talking                                 groups that it that i mentioned                                 with behavior further on the left                                 there's a an api standards group that                                 meets regularly                                 we're able to help them move from just                                 talking about api standards to                                 documenting                                 them together and documenting them in a                                 git repository and markdown                                 where they submit pull requests for                                 proposed updates to the standard and go                                 through a pull request process to                                 approve those there's another one of                                 those describing how we do                                 permissions in our aws accounts again                                 people submit pull requests to this                                 documentation from all over                                 it's not exactly working on code                                 together but you can see                                 through going through the pull request                                 workflow the shared co-creation workflow                                 again we're building that muscle and we                                 see a lot of people as they go from talk                                 and then docs                                 they naturally want to start coding                                 together i mean you get a bunch of                                 engineers together                                 writing about what they're going to do                                 talking about what we're going to do                                 it's almost inevitable people are going                                 to start coding together so we see                                 people                                 voluntarily like opt in to intersource                                 behavior if we can just get them started                                 along this dimension of maturity all                                 right so that's one                                 let's go to the next one and talk about                                 the criticality of                                 what people are collaborating on and                                 we'd like mainline daily work to get                                 done                                 uh but that can be tough it takes a lot                                 of skill how does that balance out with                                 my                                 sprints uh what does that mean for my uh                                 my uh                                 safe agile commitments or what my                                 product owner think                                 so just to get people started they can                                 start on some kind of side project                                 this could be things like a hackathon or                                 innovation time                                 we had one group at nike that built a                                 mobile app to give people an alert when                                 there's free catering available when a                                 meeting was over                                 for example just a project for fun but                                 again the collaborative muscle this idea                                 that i can work on code with people who                                 aren't on my team                                 builds that builds that mindset and                                 really leads people for this middle step                                 where's where where most folks get                                 started on shared coding projects                                 which is what i'll call a support                                 project okay                                 so a support project is something that                                 is critical to me getting my main line                                 daily work done                                 but it's not in and of itself my main                                 line work                                 let me give an example so at nike                                 probably like at your                                 your company there's there are many                                 teams that produce some kind of api                                 service okay for you know for some                                 business domain                                 and that api service needs to be                                 deployed out to the cloud so that                                 process of deployment that deployment                                 pipeline the quality checks uh setting                                 up observability                                 and moderate uh monitoring all of that                                 deployment process                                 can be a shared project that multiple                                 api services use                                 that deployment pipeline is what i'd                                 call a support project                                 it's critical to me getting my job done                                 around my api service                                 i have to have to deploy it right but it                                 is not in and of itself my api service                                 it's just something that supports that                                 and again around deployment pipelines we                                 have a rich ecosystem of people                                 contributing fixes updates enhancements                                 to shared deployment pipelines                                 they can be used by dozens or hundreds                                 of projects within the company                                 in the inner source commons there are a                                 lot of a lot of stories of                                 companies of folks getting a real start                                 to something valuable around inner                                 source                                 through these deployment pipelines or                                 devops projects                                 me is how i got my start in intersource                                 i was a team lead                                 doing a website deployment and we had a                                 shared deployment pipeline for nike's                                 websites it was used by a handful of                                 websites at first                                 and that ended up growing to the point                                 where uh dozens and then hundreds of                                 websites throughout the company ended up                                 ended up using it                                 so that's that support project                                 criticality                                 and again that builds the muscle where                                 people can then start working on their                                 main line daily work in a resource                                 fashion you know maybe if i was at api                                 service all of a sudden i realized                                 i can do more than just contribute to                                 someone else's deployment uh pipeline i                                 might take in pull requests for new                                 features in the api if i can't deliver                                 them my consumers can                                 can update that and then i'm doing inner                                 source on my main line project                                 organizationally that bottom dimension                                 the easiest thing to start with is with                                 sibling teams                                 within just some some small cross team                                 efforts usually within my same                                 organizational structure my same agile                                 my same structure my same release train                                 the daniel had talked previously about                                 the culture that's involved                                 with sibling teams they're closer to                                 being under one                                 one leader one way of working so the                                 culture is a little closer                                 there's probably some assumed norms that                                 make it easier to collaborate                                 uh an organizational leader can set                                 aside social space or time                                 in order for people to engage in inner                                 source that's a little easier                                 in the middle is engaging with other                                 business units                                 a little more difficult because there's                                 not necessarily                                 any shared culture or one single leader                                 that can                                 sanction or give space to this activity                                 and then kind of all the way across the                                 companies is the most                                 uh most difficult but also yields the                                 highest rewards and again for me this is                                 how my path                                 went with running that shared deployment                                 pipeline that i told you about                                 it started out with myself and then                                 three other teams that were all hosting                                 websites                                 in the nike.com domain we had one thing                                 that worked for the four of us and i                                 kind of thought it was going to end                                 there                                 but all of a sudden some of our other                                 consumer websites also wanted in other                                 parts of nike.com                                 so we expanded to that middle middle                                 level where you know all across                                 different business units in our area                                 they're using it and then eventually                                 this became used for our internal                                 websites our partner and b                                               we reach that cross company phase                                 and for me and my project each of these                                 phases can across team the cross                                 business unit and then cross company                                 they all took about about six months or                                 so so each so there's some time                                 needed to up level but this maturity                                 model fit                                 maternity model fit and fit fit very                                 well                                 and this is the way even now where my                                 full-time job is teaching intersours                                 teaching collaboration among teams                                 we find this very useful and what we'll                                 do is when we're engaging with                                 a new person or a new team or new                                 organization and want to help                                 teach and move them toward inner source                                 through consultation and conversation                                 we'll take a little bit of a mental                                 inventory at where people are at                                 and maybe mentally put a check mark on                                 each of these dimensions                                 like this is about how this team or                                 person or org                                 tends to collaborate today and then                                 moving them toward inner source                                 involves taking into one of these and                                 then sliding it                                 sliding it to the right sliding it more                                 toward inner source                                 now the beauty of this model is that                                 each of these dimensions                                 can be up leveled on its own                                 independently of the                                 the others these aren't necessarily                                 coupled but we can take any one of these                                 sliders basically and try to try to up                                 level it toward the right                                 what it does is let people move toward                                 inner source in                                 little gradual baby steps rather than                                 having them have to                                 like jump all the way to the right i've                                 heard as i've been talking with people                                 in the industry                                 uh stories where an intersource advocate                                 might try to teach people                                 uh behavior all the way on the right we                                 need to collaborate on on all of our                                 mainline                                 coding projects with people all across                                 the company and it's difficult                                 folks that are talking to you may not                                 have the the skill or experience                                 necessary                                 and i've heard at times unfortunately                                 people kind of throw up their hands and                                 say                                 oh you know they just weren't ready for                                 it i guess it's just not going to work                                 that's a shame because they may not have                                 been ready to jump all the way to the                                 end                                 but but if you figure out where people                                 are at and invite them to                                 just take one step forward they can do                                 that                                 and then you can invite them to take                                 another step forward and often again                                 they'll get the idea and start uploading                                 themselves along these lines of maturity                                 so it works very very well                                 now when we invite people to take the                                 next step                                 this is a social change and a cultural                                 change                                 as much or really much more than a                                 process or technical change                                 and so we've learned a lot about group                                 dynamics and how culture change                                 works at scale they're summarized very                                 well in                                 in this book in this manual how behavior                                 spreads by dr damon sintola                                 this is an academic work and what dr                                 cintola                                 has done and gone in and proven and                                 demonstrated                                 very very academically how behavior                                 change                                 happens in large social structures                                 including an enterprise                                 or a corporation his basic thesis is                                 that there's two ways to describe                                 how things spread in a social network                                 and he likens it to the spread of                                 a virus or a contagion he calls it a                                 simple contagion versus                                 a complex contagion okay simple or                                 complex                                 let me explain a simple contagion i                                 think we can all understand because                                 we're actually all living in the midst                                 of a                                 this giant simple contagion right now                                 which is the coronavirus                                 the the spread of a simple contagion is                                 that one person who is                                 infected with it can spread it to others                                 just by coming into contact with them                                 and unfortunately for all of us                                 uh you know this is how the coronavirus                                 spreads so depending on where you are in                                 the world you're probably stuck                                 at home uh i know i am and uh it's not                                 just a kind of a viral agent like the                                 one we're in right now that spreads this                                 way                                 uh dr cintola has shown that information                                 can spread this way in a company like                                 someone at the center                                 uh maybe a director as indicated in this                                 graph can communicate to their managers                                 the managers are connected with people                                 on the teams that are that are then                                 connected to each other                                 and then it spreads so there's some like                                 new initiative represented by this new                                 color                                 uh tell the managers the managers got it                                 tell the people on the teams                                 the teams have got it and you're done                                 now one                                 uh one kind of fallacy or pitfall around                                 inner source or culture change                                 is assuming that a change in behavior is                                 going to spread the same way                                 okay i've seen people try to do this                                 where the leader will say                                 okay there's this new initiative we're                                 going to change something about the way                                 we work                                 you know we're going to you know do tdd                                 or okrs or you know some kind of                                 behavior or process or culture change                                 and that's the way it's that's the way                                 it's gonna be and uh                                 it it does not spread this way this                                 change in behavior but what do people do                                 uh if you're like me you've probably                                 seen this several times and the thing                                 that people do                                 um again kind of when that new new                                 behavior                                 is evidenced by that new colors                                 communicated thing that people do is                                 they sit and watch and they see is it                                 actually going to happen                                 is anyone going to start doing it and                                 what they're doing is what dr                                 santola called is a complex contagion                                 model spread                                 in a complex contagion one point of                                 interaction with someone who's who is                                 infected with the new behavior                                 is not enough to cause the behavior to                                 spread                                 but each person needs multiple points of                                 reinforcement from those that they're                                 connected to                                 socially in order to feel like this new                                 behavior is something they want to adopt                                 so when that announcement comes out from                                 the um                                 you know from some central location hey                                 we're going to change the way we do                                 things                                 people stop and they look and they're                                 looking around them to see                                 is it actually going to happen and they                                 watch to see if people around them are                                 doing it                                 i hope that's something you've observed                                 i know i have many times they're                                 exhibiting                                 this complex contagion model of spread                                 they need multiple points of                                 reinforcement                                 so what we do at nike anytime we're                                 inviting someone to up level                                 along that collaboration maturity model                                 inviting a person inviting a team                                 inviting an org to up level                                 we intentionally set it up so that we                                 know they have multiple points of                                 reinforcement                                 that demonstrate that that new behavior                                 is a good one here's how we do it                                 when we're targeting a particular org                                 we'll identify                                 highly connected people that can act as                                 reinforcers for many many others                                 and they are the evangelists they get                                 invited to be the evangelist for that                                 new                                 that new behavior um uh these highly                                 connected people get invited to be the                                 evangelists                                 and will pull together the evangelists                                 regularly in an evangelist council                                 this allows these evangelists to                                 reinforce each other in the new behavior                                 since there's nobody in their                                 organizations yet that can act as                                 reinforcers                                 so with us and the leader at the center                                 and the evangelists                                 embedded and spread throughout the teams                                 we can then                                 communicate the new desired behavior                                 that's moving more toward                                 toward intercept source on those                                 dimensions we can communicate that                                 uh to the to people in the organizations                                 and they have those multiple points of                                 reinforcement                                 so they can adopt the new behavior those                                 people can then act as reinforcers for                                 the next set of folks that adopt a new                                 behavior                                 and so on and the the behavior keeps on                                 on spreading                                 okay so this idea                                 of intentional reinforcement this                                 complex contagion model of spreading                                 we've encapsulated it in an easy to                                 understand and remember way                                 that we'll call the two two one uh rule                                 uh let me explain how this works uh when                                 we want to go into an organization                                 up level them toward inner source invite                                 them to take the next step                                 along that maturity model you know maybe                                 they need to start                                 attending the open meetups or maybe they                                 need to start opening up their                                 repositories whatever the next step is                                 we'll make sure to that everyone here is                                 two times                                 from their vertical management chain                                 that this new behavior is desirable                                 usually from their vice president and                                 then their senior director in all hands                                 we'll also intentionally set it up so                                 they hear two times from their peers                                 these are the evangelists that this new                                 behavior is good and desired we'll bring                                 in the evangelists                                 speak it in all hands or the evangelists                                 will get into the                                 newsletter or the mailing list for this                                 organization                                 so they're hearing two times vertically                                 two times horizontally                                 that this new behavior is good and                                 desired we'll also stack the deck                                 and make sure there's some prominent                                 project in the organization                                 that adopts the new behavior new                                 behavior                                 and is successful we had an example of                                 this where                                 in one organization where we presented                                 on on the value                                 of uh sharing and marketing projects                                 internally                                 we had one project that uh presented in                                 uh one of our user forums in meetups                                 that project was able to for several                                 months in a row get a new customer every                                 single month                                 uh internally within the company through                                 these presentations they eventually                                 doubled their average                                 rate of adoption for their tool that                                 they were sharing so that was our                                 shining example and we made sure that                                 everyone                                 knew about that shining example in                                 addition to receiving those social                                 points of reinforcement so that two two                                 one rule again two vertical leaders two                                 horizontal influencers and one                                 successful project                                 has worked consistently to change                                 behavior even though we don't have                                 organizational                                 authority we can have that influence                                 broadly throughout the company                                 now in ideating kind of what behaviors                                 make sense what things we should be                                 suggesting as daniel mentioned we found                                 it very useful to work within the inner                                 source commons                                 there's a lot of resources there for                                 ideas within the inner source commons                                 there's a series of video                                 and written training segments around                                 intersource called the learning path                                 you can find them at this short url                                 there's an open                                 slack channel that you can join this url                                 where you can bounce ideas off of other                                 inner source practitioners                                 we found that very useful in getting                                 ideas and then also there's documented                                 patterns                                 uh for such and such a challenge that                                 you may have at the company                                 here's a pattern that that multiple                                 people in that situation have done in                                 other companies                                 that have worked out successfully so all                                 these things uh give us                                 give us ideas uh when we're stuck trying                                 to uplevel a particular org along the                                 maturity model                                 and then we can roll it out with the                                 with the two two one plan                                 uh so with that thanks so much you can                                 find me on the intersource common slack                                 i'm happy to take                                 a personal email                                 you
