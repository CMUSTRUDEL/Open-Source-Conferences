Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Open source collaboration requires open-mindedness and team players since every individual with varying personalities, work experience and attitude are involved. Creating an atmosphere that respects diversity increases engagement, encourages open communication and fosters accountability amongst every participant. People can collaborate better to open source project using the right collaboration and project management tools. Organizing meetings daily or weekly, asking questions, networking with coworkers, making suggestions, asking for feedbacks and guidance, sharing knowledge and assigning roles to everyone as a group or individually also ensures efficient collaboration. It is pertinent for everyone to communicate effectively and also respect peoples opinions in order to accomplish a successful open source collaboration. Four specific topics have been chosen for this talk in an effort to demonstrate the various ways of collaborating and managing open source projects. For each topic, unique tips are highlighted and principles of team management discussed.
