Title: #FOSSBack: Najeeb Khan - Creating Belonging in Remote Teams
Publication date: 2021-03-02
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Remote teams are more disconnected and fragmented now more than ever. 54% of employees are unattached from their work & company. They put in the time, but not energy or passion, often doing the minimum required.

75% of managers struggle to maintain the culture remotely and it leads to 18% drop in productivity for the team. It impacts mental health, well-being, and churn of employees.


By creating belonging through social interaction at work, it not only improves the well-being of the employees but also increases productivity.

  talk about quitting belonging in remote                               teams                               it's no surprise right now everyone's                               really used to working remotely                               and as we call it you know we're in our                               second inning of remote work                                for a lot of companies or organizations                                what they're really struggling with                                is hey we are we have                                                  but yet even though we have so many                                people on zoom                                we still feel isolated sometimes                                working remotely feels lonely for a lot                                of people                                so how do we get your remote team                                to be more connected than ever before                                that                                is what i want to share in this talk                                well let's start with you know why                                people choose                                remote work you know so right now                                the reason why people choose remote work                                is well because                                they have to they don't really have much                                choice                                but what about before why did people                                choose remote work well                                there were a whole bunch of reasons one                                flexible schedule                                working from anywhere having no commute                                spending time with family and the                                ability to work from home was                                largely one of the reasons that people                                worked from home                                and personally for myself i work                                remotely for eight years                                and again when we have                                got impacted by kovid one thing i do                                want to point out is working from only                                normal times a versus working remotely                                during the pandemic                                is two different things well                                this is how and why people are choosing                                it                                but how have our lives been impacted                                well if you look at the transition                                of everything into remote work                                a gartner study found that company                                leaders found that                                                                                                  remotely at least part of the time                                after the pandemic and almost half will                                allow                                them to work full time so it's impacted                                in the companies                                not only in first thing which is the                                talent because a lot of people are                                choosing remote work                                but also productivity because                                this is impacting because people are                                able to kind of focus                                for the most part again it depends on                                family situations but overall                                people are able to be more productive                                than they were in the office                                including job satisfaction and living                                because remote work has impacted how we                                are buying real estate and a lot of                                city centers are being displaced and                                people are going to                                other open areas like the suburbs                                that is all the benefits of it                                but what's next we've overlooked                                the downsides the biggest struggles with                                working remotely                                is one collaboration                                and two loneliness these two encompass a                                                                  of the challenges and not even                                mentioning being in a different time                                zone than your teammates                                so we're connected every single minute                                yet we still feel isolated we have slack                                project management tool video                                conferencing emails notifications upon                                notifications yet we still find it                                difficult                                to connect tech has progressed in all                                areas but without the proper                                use of tools or feeling left alone                                and when it comes to managers their                                struggles                                are the two biggest struggles are                                maintaining company culture                                and team cohesiveness almost                                           struggle with both of them but what do                                 we do                                 well even though remote teams are more                                 disconnected and fragmented                                 the thing is half of employees are                                 feeling unattached                                 to their company they put in the time                                 and they do the bare minimum work                                 this leads to productivity and burnout                                 and how do we solve it well we have to                                 understand                                 that it is not a once and done kind of                                 activity                                 it's like farming it's going to take                                 some time at the same time                                 it's like working out as well but the                                 good news is                                 there are different ways of doing it if                                 you take a look at the different                                 phases of a company from forming to                                 storming to norming to performing                                 we can create different solutions for                                 different                                 types of team members and where they are                                 on a journey                                 for people who are just starting to join                                 a team we can bring them                                 in a better fashion get and have them                                 get to know others casually                                 for storming when there's conflict                                 resolution having                                 being listened to and having                                 understanding helps a lot                                 when it comes to norming which is                                 improving cooperation                                 entertainment deepening relationships it                                 can be both sync                                 and async and when it comes to                                 performing                                 in recognizing the employee there's                                 self needs and motivation both                                 intrinsically and intrinsically helps a                                 balance                                 all that in the future one interesting                                 quote i heard from one of the holiday                                 parties that i hosted through patio                                 was that i like this party because                                 there's no pressure to drink                                 or dance or dress up we have to                                 recognize that employees have different                                 needs and                                 one solution doesn't fit for everyone                                 so if we all work together and work with                                 the team                                 to create the different activities and                                 ongoing                                 situations that helps them to belong the                                 better it is                                 whether it's a virtual cooking class or                                 yoga or weekly games night there are a                                 lot of options                                 ultimately it comes down to the                                 team itself i've had hundreds of                                 managers ask me                                 for team building ideas i always start                                 with what's the goal is it to get to                                 know others casually is it to                                 have cooperation motivation or                                 entertainment because once you can                                 understand from that point of view it                                 helps a lot                                 now it might take five to ten hours a                                 month doing this you can do it yourself                                 or you can get a partner to do this for                                 you                                 in the end it's needed because when it's                                 done right it'll improve the                                 productivity                                 mental health and well-being of                                 employees                                 i've hosted several holiday parties and                                 this was one of                                 the most crucial learnings that i've                                 learned                                 so if you have any questions or if                                 you're still trying to figure out hey                                 do you have any ideas for team building                                 or how i can help for my team
