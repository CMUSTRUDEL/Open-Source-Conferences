Title: #FOSSBack: Najeeb Khan - Creating Belonging in Remote Teams
Publication date: 2021-03-02
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Remote teams are more disconnected and fragmented now more than ever. 54% of employees are unattached from their work & company. They put in the time, but not energy or passion, often doing the minimum required.

75% of managers struggle to maintain the culture remotely and it leads to 18% drop in productivity for the team. It impacts mental health, well-being, and churn of employees.


By creating belonging through social interaction at work, it not only improves the well-being of the employees but also increases productivity.
