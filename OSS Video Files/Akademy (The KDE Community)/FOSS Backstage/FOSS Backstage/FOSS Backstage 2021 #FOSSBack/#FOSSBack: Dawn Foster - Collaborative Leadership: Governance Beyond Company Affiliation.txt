Title: #FOSSBack: Dawn Foster - Collaborative Leadership: Governance Beyond Company Affiliation
Publication date: 2021-02-25
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Open source projects that are controlled by a single company are at a greater risk of changes that are not aligned with community interests, whereas projects that are under neutral foundations have a lower risk both for end users and software vendors. With advantages that include community building, innovation, and wider adoption, we should consider contributing more of our open source projects to neutral foundations.

This talk will cover:

    Challenges of giving up control and why it might be worth it.
    Selecting a foundation and how to determine neutrality.
    Creating a fair and neutral governance structure and processes for your project.
    Tips for contributing and maintaining your project.

The audience will get practical advice about whether they should contribute their projects to neutral foundations along with how and when to do it.
