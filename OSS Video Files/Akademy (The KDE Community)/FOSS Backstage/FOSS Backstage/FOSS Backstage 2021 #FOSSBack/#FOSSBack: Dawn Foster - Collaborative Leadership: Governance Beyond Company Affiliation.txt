Title: #FOSSBack: Dawn Foster - Collaborative Leadership: Governance Beyond Company Affiliation
Publication date: 2021-02-25
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Open source projects that are controlled by a single company are at a greater risk of changes that are not aligned with community interests, whereas projects that are under neutral foundations have a lower risk both for end users and software vendors. With advantages that include community building, innovation, and wider adoption, we should consider contributing more of our open source projects to neutral foundations.

This talk will cover:

    Challenges of giving up control and why it might be worth it.
    Selecting a foundation and how to determine neutrality.
    Creating a fair and neutral governance structure and processes for your project.
    Tips for contributing and maintaining your project.

The audience will get practical advice about whether they should contribute their projects to neutral foundations along with how and when to do it.

questions into the                                questions tab                                and i'll answer a few live before we                                move into the breakout room                                today i'm going to talk about a few                                topics related to governance                                starting with a look at the differences                                between projects that are under                                foundations                                compared to projects that are run out of                                individual companies                                after that i'll talk about how                                governance is mostly about the roles and                                processes                                that guide how people collaborate and                                make decisions                                including some thoughts on how to                                document all of this in ways that set                                your project                                up project up for success then i'll wrap                                it up with a few final thoughts                                and links to hopefully some useful                                resources                                first i'll tell you a bit about me i've                                been in the technology industry for over                                                                                                      projects                                from within companies like puppet and                                intel where interestingly enough i                                worked with                                denise our last presenter at pivotal i                                was responsible for driving our                                kubernetes contribution strategy                                so that's kind of how i got involved in                                the kubernetes contributor experience                                special interest group now that i'm                                working in vmware's open source program                                office                                and i'm responsible for our open source                                community strategy                                lately i've been more active in the cncf                                contributor strategy                                sig in particular the governance working                                group                                i'm also on the steering committee for                                the linux foundation's to-do group                                where companies collaborate on ways to                                run successful open source program                                offices                                i'm also a board member of open uk which                                is focused on developing and sustaining                                leadership                                in open technology within the uk and i'm                                a governing board member and maintainer                                for the linux foundation's chaos project                                which is focused on using metrics to                                evaluate the health                                of open source projects i also have a                                phd from the university of greenwich                                here in london                                where i was researching how people                                working at many different companies                                collaborate together within the linux                                kernel                                now i wanted to start by talking about                                why                                it's so important to think about who                                owns                                or controls an open source project                                because it's something that many of us                                don't spend as much time thinking about                                as we should                                projects that are controlled by                                foundations and ones that are owned by                                an individual company can have very                                different dynamics and risks                                associated with participating in those                                projects                                it is not always clear whether a                                foundation is neutral                                or not i generally start by looking at                                the                                leadership for the foundation if the                                board of directors                                or other leadership bodies are made up                                of people who work at a wide range of                                companies                                especially if they're competing                                companies that's a good indication that                                 it's a neutral foundation with a good                                 balance of people to represent various                                 aspects within the industry                                 if the board members on the other hand                                 are primarily made up of people from a                                 single company                                 or maybe just a couple of companies that                                 have very close ties together                                 it's also not likely to be a neutral                                 foundation                                 trademarks are another thing to look at                                 in a neutral foundation                                 the foundation should own the trademarks                                 associated with for example the name of                                 the foundation                                 and probably most of the projects if the                                 trademarks are owned by a company                                 especially a single company across the                                 whole foundation that's a red flag that                                 the foundation is probably                                 not neutral it can also help to look at                                 the projects                                 under that foundation were they                                 originated at a single company                                 or did they come from a wide variety of                                 different companies                                 do those projects have leaders from a                                 variety of companies                                 do they have contributor license                                 agreements from one company                                 or is the cla from the foundation                                 the more you see references to a single                                 company across the                                 projects the less likely it is to be                                 neutral                                 and these are just a few of the many                                 things that you can look at when you're                                 trying to decide if a foundation is                                 neutral                                 the apache software foundation the cloud                                 native computing foundation cncf                                 eclipse and the linux foundation those                                 are all neutral foundations                                 on the flip side the open usage commons                                 foundation                                 is not one that i would classify as a                                 neutral foundation                                 the success of kubernetes can be                                 attributed in part to being contributed                                 to the cloud native computing foundation                                 putting kubernetes into a neutral                                 foundation with representation from a                                 bunch of different companies                                 provided a level playing field where                                 each of us                                 could collaborate and innovate as equals                                 to create something that benefits the                                 whole ecosystem                                 with neutral foundations our end users                                 get access to more innovation                                 from a diverse group of contributors                                 while also reducing vendor lock-in                                 for example users of kubernetes can                                 consume enterprise versions                                 from a wide variety of vendors that can                                 run on any of the leading cloud                                 providers                                 or they can roll their own solution                                 using open source kubernetes                                 and as software vendors we can                                 contribute to foundation-driven projects                                 with the confidence that no one company                                 is in control of the project                                 and that we can contribute as equals                                 within the community regardless of who                                 we work for                                 open source projects that are controlled                                 by a single company                                 are higher risk because they operate at                                 the whims of that company                                 whereas projects that are under neutral                                 foundations have a lower risk                                 both for end users and software vendors                                 when a project is owned by a company                                 there's little recourse for outside                                 contributors when that company decides                                 to go in a direction that doesn't align                                 with the needs or expectations of the                                 other participants within the community                                 when a project is owned or controlled by                                 a company consider the reputation                                 of that company as a steward of open                                 source projects                                 but always keep in mind that they can                                 change their strategy                                 at some later date we've seen some of                                 this with google                                 around the istio and k native projects                                 and i'm not saying that we shouldn't                                 participate in projects                                 that are owned by other companies but we                                 should                                 think about the risks that we're taking                                 in some cases                                 it makes a lot of sense to accept this                                 higher risk                                 but we should at least try to make sure                                 that we understand the risks that we're                                 taking                                 at vmware for example we believe that                                 contributing open source projects to                                 neutral foundations is important                                 and it's something that we do regularly                                 for projects that we've started once                                 they start to gain a bit of traction                                 with people outside of the company                                 for example we've contributed harbor and                                 contour to the cncf                                 we contributed turn to the linux                                 foundation's automated compliance                                 tooling project                                 we've also contributed projects to the                                 apache software foundation                                 and other foundations the challenge with                                 contributing open source projects to                                 foundations is that you also give up                                 some of your control to the foundation                                 typically                                 assets like the project's trademark                                 repositories                                 websites and other things would be                                 transferred to the foundation                                 existing maintainers and leaders will                                 usually keep their positions                                 however neutral foundations usually make                                 sure that governance                                 is set up in a way that makes it easy                                 for people from other companies to                                 participate                                 and eventually move into leadership                                 positions so as the contributing company                                 you should expect more leadership                                 transitions over the longer term which                                 is                                 perfectly healthy and while this does                                 mean giving up some control over the                                 project                                 there are a lot of benefits with                                 advantages around community building                                 innovation and wider adoption it's                                 something that we should at least                                 consider for our open source projects                                 it's also important to think about when                                 your project might be ready                                 to contribute to a neutral foundation if                                 your project is very immature and just                                 getting started                                 foundations are less likely to be                                 interested                                 in your project whereas a project with a                                 bunch of users that's starting to get                                 really good traction within the industry                                 that just maybe needs some help moving                                 up to the next level                                 is going to be a lot more likely to be                                 accepted by a foundation                                 and however however companies should                                 understand                                 that contributing a project to a                                 foundation is an ongoing commitment                                 it is not an exit strategy and you need                                 to be prepared to provide                                 staff and other support over the long                                 term and the short term                                 just like you would if you weren't                                 contributing it to a foundation                                 we've been doing quite a bit of work                                 within the cncf contributor strategy                                 sig in the governance working group to                                 help document some governance best                                 practices                                 and this section contains ideas                                 inspiration and materials that i've been                                 working on                                 along with other people like josh burkus                                 for example within the working group                                 so a lot of people really like to hate                                 on governance                                 it's just extra paperwork it's busy work                                 it's                                 politics that get in the way of doing                                 the real                                 work on the project the reality is                                 governance                                 can be found in all open source projects                                 in one form                                 or another to specify the processes for                                 how                                 people work together within the project                                 ideally                                 it will be clearly documented but for                                 some projects                                 especially smaller ones it might be a                                 bit more ad hoc                                 and informal governance helps outline                                 the expectations                                 around roles and responsibilities along                                 with the decision-making processes                                 so it's important to have at least the                                 basics in place early                                 since it's one of those things you may                                 think you don't need                                 until you realize you do it's usually                                 easier                                 to set clear expectations up front                                 rather than realizing                                 later that various people have very                                 different expectations                                 which can take a lot more time to sort                                 out this doesn't mean that you need to                                 specify everything up front                                 and i would discourage you from over                                 engineering your governance processes                                 before you need them                                 a project with only a few people will                                 not need elaborate elections to select                                 leaders but you should probably define                                 a few basic roles like maintainer to                                 find the process for contributing to                                 your project                                 and talk about how decisions about those                                 contributions are made                                 if the process for collaboration and                                 decision making are                                 not clearly documented as part of the                                 project governance                                 this can increase the risk of                                 participating in or using the project                                 because it introduces a lot of                                 uncertainty into the mix                                 knowing how collaboration occurs and how                                 decisions are made                                 is vital to being able to make                                 contributions that are more likely to be                                 accepted                                 there are a few documents that every                                 project even the small ones should have                                 it should go without saying but open                                 source projects need                                 the appropriate licensing documentation                                 i                                 occasionally find repos with missing                                 license files                                 but more often i see licenses not                                 applied correctly                                 within projects so in addition to just                                 checking the box to put a license file                                 in your repository                                 some licenses do actually require other                                 things                                 like a notices file or license headers                                 within each source file you should also                                 have a code of conduct                                 that people can easily find with details                                 about how to report                                 incidents along with the consequences of                                 violating the code of conduct                                 now sometimes people who are new to                                 implementing code of conduct                                 codes of conduct find it intimidating                                 because i think it's something they need                                 to write from scratch                                 so don't do that i would encourage you                                 to use something like the contributor                                 covenant which is pretty much the gold                                 standard for codes of conduct right now                                 and it can be simply copied and added to                                 your repository                                 now the bit that you do need to spend                                 some time on                                 is making sure that you have a plan for                                 enforcing it you'll need to nominate a                                 couple of people                                 who will be responsible for taking                                 reports of violations                                 and handling them responsibly the                                 contributor covenant page has more                                 details and links                                 to resources for learning about                                 implementing and enforcing a code of                                 conduct                                 your contribution documents should                                 provide enough details about the                                 contribution process so that someone                                 new to the project can make their very                                 first contribution                                 this includes details about how to sign                                 your contributor license agreement if                                 you have one or how to use the                                 developer certificate of origin or dco                                 process                                 if you have strong preferences about                                 coding style testing documentation or                                 other requirements                                 this is a good opportunity to make sure                                 that new contributors know these upfront                                 which helps reduce the burden of trying                                 to educate each                                 individual contributor separately about                                 your requirements                                 while you're also trying to review their                                 contributions                                 and you'll want to make sure that your                                 contributors know what to expect                                 and how to navigate the project when                                 making contributions                                 the communication process should be                                 clearly defined                                 so that people know where and how to                                 communicate within the project                                 maybe you prefer mailing list                                 discussions or                                 slack messages or issues or feature                                 requests                                 and maybe you have separate                                 communication channels for users and                                 another one for developers                                 make sure everyone understands how                                 people within the project communicate                                 with each other                                 to avoid a frustrating experience not                                 just for new contributors but also for                                 your existing ones                                 projects should also document the                                 processes for reporting                                 and responding to security issues                                 projects that take a really proactive                                 approach                                 to addressing security issues and                                 releasing fixes                                 are much more likely to be secure you                                 could also be using some automated tools                                 like dependabot                                 just for example to help identify when                                 new versions of dependencies                                 are available which also helps keep on                                 top of potential security issues                                 and while there are no guarantees and                                 critical security issues can sort of                                 pop up at any time taking a proactive                                 approach to security reduces the                                 likelihood of having security issues                                 that will be                                 exploited later the project should have                                 a security.md file or another document                                 with                                 details about the process for reporting                                 and responding to security concerns                                 at a minimum you want to have a way for                                 people to privately report security                                 issues and have a few people who are                                 designated to handle those issues                                 large projects that are used by vendors                                 within their commercial products                                 should also have things like embargo                                 lists where you can provide them with                                 private information to those vendors and                                 give them some time to prepare                                 their security fixes for their products                                 in advance of the security issue                                 becoming public to help them                                 avoid being exploited using your open                                 source project                                 when the issue does eventually become                                 public                                 you should have some kind of                                 documentation about your leadership                                 for small projects you might just need a                                 list of maintainers in your readme file                                 or maybe owners or maintainers files                                 that indicate                                 which people are responsible for the                                 various areas within your project                                 defining the roles and responsibilities                                 for contributors                                 reviewers and maintainers is probably                                 enough as a first step                                 which can then help you with recruiting                                 new people into these roles                                 for bigger projects you'll want to have                                 more details                                 about the specific roles and                                 responsibilities for the different                                 leadership roles                                 along with how others can then move into                                 those leadership positions                                 you might have committees working groups                                 special interest groups                                 or other groups that will eventually                                 need leaders and again having all this                                 documented helps you recruit                                 new leaders as you try to grow the                                 project and need more people to share in                                 the workload                                 there are quite a few different options                                 for selecting leaders                                 as part of defining your governance and                                 the ideal is to have a process that                                 provides a fair                                 and level playing field that defines how                                 contributors                                 can become leaders this should be                                 documented                                 so that all participants can clearly                                 understand the criteria and process for                                 moving both                                 into and then out of leadership                                 positions                                 most of the bigger projects like                                 kubernetes have an election process                                 at least for the top levels of                                 leadership like a steering committee                                 and at lower levels of leadership many                                 projects have a process where                                 existing leaders then select new leaders                                 for example new maintainers are often                                 nominated by existing maintainers and                                 approved after                                 a certain number of maintainers agree or                                 sometimes it requires a vote                                 by other maintainers or committee                                 members and there are a bunch of                                 different options for selecting leaders                                 so i won't try to cover them all here                                 but there is an entire                                 document devoted to these options                                 available at the link on the bottom of                                 the slide for more details                                 your project governance should be                                 designed                                 to keep diversity equity and inclusion                                 top of mind building a diverse community                                 where all people feel welcome and                                 included does                                 not just happen it requires putting work                                 and thought into it and when you're                                 starting a project and thinking about                                 governance this is a good time to do                                 this                                 i talked about codes of conduct earlier                                 and having a code of conduct that you                                 actively enforce                                 helps make sure that everyone feels safe                                 and welcome                                 within your community providing an                                 environment where everyone                                 including people from marginalized                                 populations feel                                 safe is the first step toward building a                                 diverse community around your project                                 you should also look at whether you have                                 a diverse set of people                                 at every level within the project but                                 especially at leadership positions                                 and if not come up with programs that                                 help underrepresented folks get involved                                 and then move up within your project                                 ideally having programs that provide                                 people opportunities for shadowing                                 mentoring and sponsoring new potential                                 leaders can help you grow                                 a diverse set of people into new leaders                                 for your project                                 the kubernetes contributor experience                                 sig is a great place to see an example                                 of how to implement programs for things                                 like shadowing and mentoring                                 projects that make a concerted effort to                                 bring in new people from a variety of                                 backgrounds                                 and have programs in place that help                                 them grow into leadership positions                                 are more likely to benefit from                                 increased innovation and have a                                 healthier community                                 diversity inclusion can also be                                 difficult to measure                                 and it often involves mostly a manual                                 assessment                                 but we've defined some metrics within                                 the chaos projects                                 diversity equity and inclusion working                                 group that you should have a look at                                 for ideas about measuring various                                 aspects so that you can improve your                                 projects                                 diversity equity and inclusion                                 governance is one of those things that                                 is never really                                 finished we work in a space with                                 constant                                 change the technologies change                                 our strategies change the way we work                                 in a pandemic for example can completely                                 change                                 everything changes and our governance                                 needs to evolve right along with these                                 changes                                 in particular as open source projects                                 become more mature                                 and grow what they need from governance                                 will change                                 dramatically the governance processes                                 that you need as a small                                 project when you only have a couple of                                 maintainers is likely to be insufficient                                 if the project grows dramatically                                 so as your projects evolve your                                 governance                                 should evolve right along with them                                 now before i wrap up the talk let me                                 leave you with a few resources that you                                 might find                                 useful the to do group has a bunch of                                 guides that have                                 great information about creating and                                 managing healthy projects                                 and many of them talk about various                                 aspects of governance                                 the cncf contributor strategy sig has a                                 governance working group                                 with more details about what you need                                 for governance and some options for                                 leadership selection                                 the open source way guidebook is a                                 fantastic resource it has an entire                                 chapter on governance with loads of                                 details                                 and these are all really great starting                                 places for understanding how to govern                                 your open source project                                 there are so many aspects of good                                 governance                                 for open source projects and i only had                                 time to talk in detail about a few of                                 the ones that i                                 think are the most important but taking                                 a step back                                 and you know looking at the big picture                                 what i have on the slide                                 is the common theme that drives why i                                 think                                 governance as a whole is so important                                 governance provides a framework for                                 setting expectations for roles                                 responsibilities how people within your                                 project should behave                                 but clearly documenting these                                 expectations you can reduce uncertainty                                 and make it easier for people to                                 participate in your project                                 the more you can do to help everyone                                 participate in meaningful ways                                 the more welcome they'll feel within                                 your open source                                 community with that i will say                                 thank you for coming to my talk and i                                 think we have a little time for                                 questions um yes thank you for that uh                                 wonderful talk                                 um i have a question because                                 um here at frostbackstage we                                 like to think of ourselves as a non-code                                 contributors to open source projects um                                 by doing what we do and we've                                 been trying to make uh improvements to                                 our diversity and inclusivity                                 and um i've been working on that and one                                 of the problems that i                                 i struggled with is the metrics is                                 is finding ways to to to measure that                                 and to know um the right ways to do it                                 and                                 um what to be looking for and things                                 like that i wonder if                                 you have any uh thoughts or tips or                                 advice for stuff like that                                 yeah absolutely i think the so the                                 non-code contributions                                 are an incredibly important part of any                                 open source project right so it's not                                 just about writing the code there's all                                 this other stuff that has to happen                                 along with it just like you know any                                 other project at any company                                 and it is it is harder to measure um                                 primarily because a lot of that work                                 actually happens outside of github which                                 tends to be                                 or outside of your code repository or                                 your issues whatever whatever you happen                                 to use                                 which makes it a lot harder to track now                                 one of the ways that the kubernetes                                 project addressed this is they really                                 try to do                                 most of the work through through github                                 and using github issues so i was uh one                                 of the organizers for the contributor                                 um the contributor summit kubernetes                                 contributor summit                                 and one of the things that we did is we                                 had we had github project boards we had                                 issues for each of the individual you                                 know elements                                 and you know we would comment on them we                                 would keep those issues updated                                 and we also had you know markdown files                                 in the github repository that had                                 details                                 about what we were doing to organize the                                 contributor summit                                 so that gave us you know legitimate ways                                 to kind of measure that                                 and then you know the other i think                                 maybe part of the other half of your                                 question was how do you how do you get                                 more people                                 um involved and one of the things that                                 also within the kubernetes community                                 that they do                                 is they have really good shadowing                                 programs                                 what that means is that when i you know                                 when i'm working in the contributor                                 uh for the contributor summit it's if                                 i'm leading a section of it                                 i usually have a shadow who then helps                                 me do some of the work                                 under under my leadership with the idea                                 that then that shadow if they enjoyed                                 that experience                                 and it was a positive one and things                                 worked really well that they're                                 likely to actually lead that component                                 in the next round                                 so um so that actually works                                 uh works quite well the kubernetes                                 community does that around a few issues                                 they do it for the release team as well                                 so that you know not the it's not the                                 same set of people who are always                                 involved in the release which is kind of                                 a                                 it's a daunting task and it's a lot of                                 work and it's you know to do that                                 every single every single release is                                 really hard and so they have the                                 really robust shadowing program where                                 they have multiple shadows for every                                 single role                                 and it's a really good way to mentor                                 people into the community because they                                 can                                 they can help out they can see what it's                                 like and                                 you know then hopefully move into a                                 leadership position later                                 great that sounds really interesting um                                 i have a question for you from the chat                                 it says um how can we best document ways                                 to improve                                 governance processes so that newcomers                                 can truly understand                                 the best ways to improve governance and                                 processes                                 too yeah that's a really good question i                                 think i think that depends a lot                                 on the size of the project i think um                                 you know if you're kind of a smaller                                 project and you don't have a lot of                                 governance documentation                                 i think the first step is to actually                                 beef up the governance documentation                                 um you know the other the other thing                                 that you can do                                 is you can you can have a group that's                                 actually responsible for that                                 so i mean obviously the cnc app is a you                                 know very large organization with no                                 projects and so the you know we have                                 this contributor strategy sig within the                                 cncf                                 and there's a governance working group                                 and so we help the cncf                                 come up with best practices                                 documentation things like that so you                                 can do something similar for your                                 project where you have a couple of                                 people who are responsible for kind of                                 maintaining the governance of the                                 the project you know a lot of a lot of                                 projects it's usually some like a                                 steering committee                                 or or something like that that maintains                                 a lot of the governance documentation                                 so in those cases it's a little harder                                 to get new people                                 um involved but you know in general like                                 having having                                 working groups and you know special                                 interest groups focused on things like                                 maintaining the governance i think is a                                 really good idea for projects i mean                                 that's                                 one thing i think the kubernetes                                 community has done a really good job of                                 is you know they have all of these                                 different working groups and special                                 interest groups that are                                 involved in very different things and so                                 it's easy coming into the                                 the project to you know just find                                 something that interests you and start                                 start going to their meetings start you                                 know watching watching their issues and                                 pr's on github and you can really kind                                 of kind of see what's going on                                 but but i do think the governance piece                                 is a little bit harder because there                                 are definitely definitely some nuances                                 associated with governance and it's                                 um it's not it's not easy to put                                 together governance for a project so it                                 does                                 it does take some work usually from you                                 know some more experienced people once                                 once the project gets faster                                 but i think you know pull people in and                                 and and have them help out maybe                                 maybe shadowing somebody would be a good                                 opportunity for that as well if you have                                 somebody                                 working on overhauling some of the                                 governance i think that might be a good                                 opportunity to get more people involved
