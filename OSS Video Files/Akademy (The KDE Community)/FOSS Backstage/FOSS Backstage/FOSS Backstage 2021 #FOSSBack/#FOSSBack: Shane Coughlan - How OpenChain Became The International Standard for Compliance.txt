Title: #FOSSBack: Shane Coughlan - How OpenChain Became The International Standard for Compliance
Publication date: 2021-02-25
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	This talk will explore the process of building and deploying the first Linux Foundation ISO standard in fourteen years in collaboration with the Joint Development Foundation. It will explain why the evolution from de facto industry standard to formal standardization was important for open source compliance in the context of areas like sale, procurement and M&A. An equal amount of time will be spent providing a guide to the journey itself, as the lessons learned are applicable to all projects building out specifications or code that seek worldwide, lasting adoption across multiple industries. The standardization process will be framed in the context of timely engagement, with SPDX queued to be the second Joint Development Foundation PAS submission behind OpenChain, and everyone involved ready to support more projects undertaking a similar journey in the months and years ahead. In practical terms, this talk will allow the audience to come away with a clear understanding of how we will take open source and standards to the next level.

	                              when i started                               things like license compliance was still                               a little bit uncertain                               uh there was some ambiguity around                               whether                               actual litigation in court would be                               effective with licenses                               and of course thanks to                               time from individuals like harold velter                                thanks to law firms like jbb led by till                                yeager                                those issues were ironed out and open                                source licensing became a lot                                clearer a lot easier to understand                                now in recent years a lot of the                                discussion around open source license                                compliance                                has been about how to make it as                                consistent                                as effective and as efficient as                                possible                                so of course when we're dealing with say                                commercial use of open source                                we do have to try to make sure that very                                long supply chains                                can have effective open source license                                compliance                                and that is not as simple as telling                                people they should know the terms of the                                license and they should use it                                it requires a great deal of education                                and it requires effective process                                management                                so in some ways in                                                     from the                                advocacy and basic proof phase                                into the process management phase of                                open source license compliance                                and more generally open source                                governance                                and that introduces some complexity but                                it also introduces clarity                                and today i want to talk about how we                                actually have created an iso standard                                for open source license compliance                                where it comes from where it's going and                                what that means for you                                whether you're an individual developer                                you're a small company or a                                multinational                                so to get started around                                     a discussion kicked off between                                various lawyers mostly at the time                                about what would be the key requirements                                of an open source                                compliance program you know what are the                                absolute must-haves                                and various approaches to outlining                                those key requirements were                                noodled people thought what if we had                                checklists explaining everything and                                then people                                reanalyzed it and said a checklist will                                be inherently suitable for a certain                                company size                                and market sector how do we make this                                universal                                so by                                                                formally created                                and designed to do this to create a                                clear short specification that outlined                                the key requirements of open source                                compliance                                without making it burdensome without                                making it market specific                                and without making it company size                                specific                                now people are very familiar often with                                things like open source                                tooling for instance fossology                                turn we have things like reuse software                                as an approach to managing software                                a little higher than that up in the                                stack                                more abstract you've got software bill                                of materials like spdx                                now open chain decided to take the very                                top level                                the high level process management and to                                focus the energy there                                in other words open chain is designed to                                set the foundation                                and the framework where people apply                                software of materials                                tooling and so on so the idea                                that was implemented is to define                                inflection points                                and in the particular case of open chain                                to define                                 in a company at what inflection point                                 do you need to put a process so you know                                 inbound                                 understand what software is coming in                                 under what license                                 internally have training policy and                                 processes and outbound                                 understand what's going out under what                                 license                                 these are very foundational things but                                 it's very important to clearly                                 describe them so that companies can                                 implement in process management                                 and whether they're doing it through                                 pre-existing                                 software management processes or they're                                 implementing it for the first time                                 this frames what they do at open source                                 licensing                                 and the goal for open chain is to make                                 the supply chain                                 more conformant to make sure that                                 mistakes don't occur                                 so company by company as people adopt                                 open chain                                 the chance of errors is dramatically                                 reduced and just as important                                 because everyone's using the same                                 process management if something happens                                 you can go very quickly through the                                 supply chain                                 and find out where there's a broken link                                 and fix it                                 so this essentially dramatically reduces                                 complexity                                 and increases efficiency two of the                                 major things we needed to get done                                 to really get this solved and just as a                                 side note                                 the supply chain is enormously complex                                 it's quite rare to have a product come                                 to market                                 that isn't touched by                                            companies                                 so it's really vital that we have a                                 methodology for doing this                                 now open chain went to market in uh                                 october                                           by april                                      we'd had a few iterations of the                                 standard we had enormous                                 growth in terms of community engagement                                 from companies and also multiple sector                                 growth                                 so it was very clear the standard was                                 working the current iteration was solid                                 and it was time to think about how we                                 turn it from a de facto industry                                 standard into a formal                                 international standard so in april                                      we submitted it into a special process                                 in iso                                 where you literally convert an indus                                 uh de facto industry standard into a                                 formal standard so it's not a re-editing                                 process or anything like that it's a                                 conversion process                                 submitted in april last year we                                 graduated in december                                 and therefore we now have an iso                                 standard for open source license                                 compliance                                 now let's talk about what that really                                 means                                 so at the very basic level if people                                 are conforming to iso                                      or open chain                                                        have the key requirements of a quality                                 open source compliance program                                 in place that ranges from training                                 the appropriate people through to having                                 internal and external touch points for                                 compliance questions these                                 facts are very useful to know both for                                 anyone who wants to ask the company a                                 question                                 or internally for the company's staff                                 who need to respond                                 the type of entities supporting this                                 international                                 standard are very diverse so here's                                 the platinum members of the project                                 these are the board companies                                 and as you can see it's everyone from                                 silicon with arm and qualcomm                                 through to cloud where companies like                                 google and microsoft                                 and the diversity of these companies in                                 market sector                                 is only the beginning of the                                 illustration of how diverse the actual                                 project is there's many hundreds of                                 companies involved plenty of individuals                                 involved                                 and when it comes to market sectors when                                 it comes to industry areas it's                                 remarkable                                 i'll give you two examples just for fun                                 one                                 is that a few months ago an ethical bank                                 in myanmar became open chain conformant                                 uh another major major engagement with                                 open chain and contributor                                 has been philip morris international in                                 switzerland because of their work on the                                 ikios electric                                 cigarette you know we're talking about a                                 massive diversity of companies all                                 around the world                                 being touched by the international                                 standard for open source compliance                                 of course the platinum members are the                                 key driver of this                                 uh but the community as a whole has                                 terrific local activity terrific subject                                 matter                                 groups and uh the outreach is                                 exceptional                                 so when it comes to companies that are                                 adopting the open chain standard                                 um it varies it moves really quickly                                 and not all companies get listed on our                                 website                                 uh it's an optional thing but here are                                 some examples of people                                 using iso right now                                 or equivalent so it's companies like                                 toyota                                 it's companies like cisco it's microsoft                                 and so on                                 and these companies of course are                                 influencing their supply chains and                                 accelerating the adoption                                 and that helps clean up everything for                                 everyone                                 now there's also companies who are                                 conforment with previous versions                                 of the specification before it was ready                                 for iso                                 and some of them are converting so one                                 company that                                 just converted on this slide is hitachi                                 which just announced a couple of days                                 ago                                 that they've moved to the iso conformant                                 program                                 and we've got a bunch more announcements                                 in the pipeline                                 it's exciting it's great and we're very                                 glad                                 uh to see companies not only adopting                                 open chain                                 but gradually coalescing around the iso                                 standard itself                                 now i mentioned the community is                                 incredible and it is                                 so we have a global mailing list with                                 almost                                                   uh we've got global automotive and                                 reference tooling work groups                                 the reference tooling work group                                 actually meets every two weeks which is                                 exceptionally frequent                                 we've got china japan korea taiwan                                 germany and u.s                                 work groups and we have                                 just recently added first of all an                                 education                                 work group for the globe and also an                                 indian work group                                 for a local region a significant local                                 region                                 and these these communities aren't just                                 talking they're creating stuff like                                 supplier education leaflets                                 new types of checklists and so on                                 so let's explain what i meant by that                                 the standard is a specification                                 it's basically seven relatively widely                                 spaced                                 uh pages of text saying you should do                                 this to accomplish this                                 and you can read the standard to adopt                                 it                                 or you can use something like our online                                 self-certification                                 questionnaire which is free and private                                 people use it actually for                                 self-certification but more generally                                 for health checks and anyone can go                                 there and                                 join in but when it comes to actually                                 doing that adopting a standard whether                                 you choose to read the specification or                                 to use our self-certification                                 questionnaire                                 people often have a lot of questions                                 we aren't prescriptive we don't say you                                 have to have this training program                                 or that open source policy like i said                                 any company                                 any size any market any culture                                 but we do try to provide reference                                 material to help people answer the                                 questions and answer yes                                 and if they can't answer yes today they                                 can pick up some reference material and                                 build from there                                 the material is extremely comprehensive                                 from case studies with companies like                                 toyota                                 to reference training slides built out                                 of information from qualcomm                                 samsung philips arm and others                                 to translations in multiple languages                                 we keep a bunch of it on the website for                                 example the curriculum and supplier                                 education is first touch once you get to                                 our website                                 but it's really on github where you'll                                 find just the epic amount of material                                 contributed from all over the world as                                 companies and individuals and law firms                                 share the information                                 so that anyone can get references about                                 pretty much anything                                 when it comes to open source compliance                                 it's it's well worth a look at that um                                 and it's in                                 multiple languages not everything is                                 translated by everyone it tends to be                                 communities translate their stuff of                                 interest                                 but it's certainly significant and uh                                 apart from the specification itself                                 and apart from the case studies where                                 it's like toyota did                                 this everything else                                 is public domain it's                                 cc                                                       step on our poor part because we want                                 people to incorporate all the knowledge                                 anywhere they want                                 without any restrictions uh and that's                                 been tremendously successful                                 tremendously successful now                                 the project is companies solving their                                 own problem                                 but part of that discussion is also                                 being how do we get support                                 how do we make sure that let's say a                                 small company in germany                                 who is working on open source licensed                                 compliance now they're adopting open                                 chain                                 but they have a question who do they ask                                 it to                                 and we've worked to build out a partner                                 program                                 with entities that have information                                 about open source                                 have information about open chain and                                 have made a clear commitment                                 to explaining open chain to their                                 customer base and the people who come                                 along                                 so here's an example of law firms                                 i mentioned till in his law firm jbb in                                 germany it's

    states                                 osborne clark uk array law italy                                 all over the world law firms with a lot                                 of experience in this field and some                                 great people are available to help                                 we also now work with a lot of service                                 providers                                 each of the service providers here has                                 engaged with the project they've come to                                 understand it                                 and they've reached agreements with us                                 regarding how they will                                 both explain and advocate open chain and                                 the                                 the optics the way they'll do that                                 and of course we have some vendors and                                 so on most of the tooling vendors are                                 relatively recent                                 to the open chain program and just like                                 everyone else                                 they've committed to both understanding                                 clearly what we do                                 and also understanding things like the                                 open chain project                                 doesn't recommend anything in particular                                 of course                                 but you know by and large are user                                 companies when they talk about tooling                                 are mostly talking about open source                                 tooling for open source compliance                                 and our tooling vendors are fully aware                                 of that                                 and they know that when it comes to                                 let's say talking about tooling                                 what we really want to do is make sure                                 there's perfect interoperability                                 it should be perfectly possible to scan                                 with phostology                                 in one place in your company scan with                                 white source in another                                 use foss id elsewhere and all the                                 information just to flow perfectly                                 through                                 all of that stuff using something like                                 ingest                                 and export up spdx and we've got third                                 party certifiers                                 so i'm not going to go into too much                                 detail on that but basically                                 you can self-certify to the standard or                                 you can get help                                 or you can literally get someone to do                                 it for you like pricewaterhousecooper or                                 said it's been really cool on the third                                 party certification                                 we honestly don't expect that to be by                                 any measure                                 the majority of what happens in the                                 project self-certification we believe                                 will always be the majority and then                                 independent                                 assessment support and then much smaller                                 third-party certification                                 but in areas like automotive aviation                                 defense                                 it's very important to have third-party                                 certification and we already have it                                 we're really                                 glad that before we became an iso                                 standard we had all of this                                 in place so when it comes to adopting a                                 standard like this                                 i mentioned different ways                                 self-certification is                                 where you literally do it yourself and                                 that's what a lot of people do                                 a lot of companies do that like i'll                                 give you an example microsoft did that                                 they self-certified so did google                                 um so did qualcomm so did arm                                 but some companies want to have someone                                 come in                                 and double check the self-certification                                 maybe offer some advice                                 it could be a law firm it could be a                                 service provider like wipro                                 and that's independent compliance                                 assessment where someone just drops in                                 helps you out or in some cases maybe                                 your customer company said oh                                 thank you supplier it's great that                                 you're self-certified but i want to have                                 jbb just check you out and then there's                                 third party certification where                                 someone does it for you and naturally                                 you can                                 see that self-certification is the                                 cheapest and then it gets more expensive                                 from there                                 but those people who are investing in                                 third party certification                                 it's a significant part of their market                                 requirements                                 now i do have details about what each of                                 these things is but                                 i'm going to skim over that just to say                                 that self-certification is                                 the heart of open chain you know this is                                 vitally important it works and it's                                 available                                 at this url anytime for anyone company                                 individual whatever go play                                 and when we were starting                                            were some concerns                                 will people misuse self-certification                                 will they say that they are certified                                 when they're not                                 and after now amazingly about five years                                 in market                                 uh the answer is no in fact the problem                                 if any that we've had is that people                                 tend to overshoot                                 rather than undershoot so people tend to                                 go process heavy                                 rather than process light and we began                                 to have anyone                                 misrepresent what they're doing in                                 self-certification                                 i think it's probably because one of the                                 parts of our self-certification the                                 final part basically says                                 uh document how you did it and that                                 means any customer company can just be                                 like okay show me that                                 show me that documentation independent                                 assessment like i said                                 someone comes in law firm consultancy                                 accounting firm                                 and they just see what you did and they                                 might have some suggestions                                 uh this is very popular in some areas we                                 actually                                 to be honest borrowed this from                                 functional safety                                 where the iso                                       functional safety standard explicitly                                 has                                 uh independent compliances while                                 independent security assessment for them                                 and uh yeah it's it's actually pretty                                 popular                                 i think a lot of companies like the                                 sanity check of having someone                                 saying what they think and it's cost                                 efficient as well you know you can pay                                 for as much as you want                                 the third-party certification i'll just                                 give an example                                 pwc has a whole software um asset                                 management platform                                 and they can implement the processes for                                 you                                 so that you'll be open chain conformant                                 and third party certified                                 and whether it's pwc or tip said they're                                 going to give you a literal certificate                                 saying that they certified you uh you                                 know                                 like i said i think that's really                                 something for automotive aviation                                 defense those kind of people it's not                                 something that would be super common in                                 consumer electronics                                 probably let's see let's see                                 but the big point is this                                 we have built a standard that identifies                                 the actual inflection points where                                 things can go wrong where we know things                                 have gone wrong                                 and we know that if people put processes                                 here                                 things are much less likely to go wrong                                 and                                 much more likely to be fixed so it's a                                 very                                 simple elegant idea and                                 after all these years in market we know                                 that self-certification is working well                                 and having enormous companies like                                 toyota self-certify                                 is proof of scaling and it inspires the                                 rest of the automotive industry                                 we have built support for this project                                 all of that reference material all of                                 the stuff like the partners                                 who explicitly work with us on this                                 and we seek to make sure everyone's got                                 freedom of choice to get license                                 compliance right                                 but there's no ambiguity in the process                                 process management                                 that people need and if there's one                                 thing i'd like you to take away                                 it's that open chain project is run by                                 user companies for                                 user companies and these are the people                                 with the problem solving the problem                                 and this means an extremely clear                                 extremely effective vision for getting                                 this right                                 as few problems as possible likely to                                 occur                                 as quick remediation as possible likely                                 to occur                                 and of course clarity so so much less is                                 spent on                                 digging through uncertainty and bespoke                                 approaches                                 we'd love for you to be part of this                                 individual or company                                 every mind counts you can join our                                 community by going to the open chain                                 project website                                 and like i said you can go to the self                                 certification or health check                                 and just play around with it and see                                 what the standard's like                                 what the questions are go have a look at                                 our reference material                                 and there i wrap it up i think sam gave                                 me a                                 a                                                               we've got about five left i suppose for                                 any questions if you have them                                 thank you so much shane we do have a                                 little extra time for questions and this                                 is a broad and potentially                                 technical topic which affects many of                                 the audience members directly i                                 imagine i'm not seeing questions just                                 yet                                 please go ahead and add them in the chat                                 or in the questions tab                                 and in the meantime i have a question                                 for you shane which is about the number                                 of firms                                 which i've seen increasingly selling uh                                 compliance services for open source                                 firms like white source fossa sneak                                 uh i'm sure you're aware of these and                                 some of their marketing and i wonder                                 whether you                                 feel that they're solving genuine                                 important legal issues these companies                                 are helping with compliance of different                                 kinds including potentially open chain                                 or if you feel that they're adding                                 unnecessary doubt to the to the sector                                 like do they complement your work with                                 open chain or how does the commercial                                 ecosystem fit                                 i like that question i think uh the                                 history of the commercial ecosystem                                 has been relatively negative so                                          ago a lot of the service providers were                                 using extremely negative language about                                 open source compliance                                 so my perspective is that started in a                                 bad place                                 um and i i certainly wasn't happy with                                 the marketing i saw                                                                                                  basically open source is dangerous we'll                                 help constrain it for you                                 i think that the messaging has gone like                                 a lot better i think user companies got                                 tired                                 of the endless negativity and they just                                 didn't believe it i mean                                 it's very hard to tell a major                                 corporation using open source                                 that it's a terrible thing if they've                                 spent a decade knowing it's not                                 and i think that has helped change the                                 market message in the context of open                                 chain                                 our strategy with working with vendors                                 is to bring them in                                 with our partner agreement and                                 essentially                                 frame their services in the context of                                 open chain                                 in the way that we talk about open chain                                 so                                 we're trying to encourage the companies                                 to have                                 a non-negative messaging to focus on                                 actually solving the problems like let's                                 say can we have discoverability                                 not that open source is dangerous but do                                 we have adequate discoverability                                 and to be honest i think that is a                                 pretty                                 good long-term strategy i mean the                                 companies have been moving away from                                 negativity and talking about                                 optimization for a while                                 but i think things like open chain will                                 boost                                 positive discussion particularly because                                 if there's one thing open chain                                 is prescriptive about is that people                                 should have choice                                 interoperability should just work and if                                 people aren't doing that there's                                 something wrong                                 and you know i've said it to all our                                 tooling vendors in the ecosystem                                 companies like                                 synopsis with black duck or white source                                 foss id                                 you know ultimately they're going to                                 have to have                                 transparent interoperability between                                 each other and the open source tools                                 in the future because that's where we're                                 going i mean we've got                                 over                                                                   group                                 those companies are working on open                                 source tooling for open source                                 compliance and whether it's                                 you know ort or its fossology or scan                                 code                                 they want it perfectly interoperable so                                 yeah i do think that vendors were in a                                 pretty bad place a decade ago                                 i think it's getting a lot better i                                 think i think things like the open chain                                 partner program                                 will align the vendors around the                                 interoperability and positive messaging                                 because well                                 i mean these are the user companies                                 coalesced we've literally made the                                 standard                                 uh kind of it's like people have to work                                 with that now                                 and i want to give credit i mean                                 companies like blackduck                                 synopsis jumped in to open chain very                                 enthusiastically they've hauled                                 multiple webinars actively promoting                                 open chain                                 uh not in the sense of you must use                                 black duck but more in the sense of this                                 is where the industry's going okay                                 and that's great i think that's exactly                                 what we want to see                                 white source is new we're just about to                                 kick off some webinars with them and i                                 expect exactly the same                                 but anyway the big picture is open chain                                 is agnostic regarding what you do in                                 automation                                 but we're going to make sure that it                                 suits the user companies                                 that means interoperability it means                                 realistic uh                                 risk assessment it means not pretending                                 that this is terribly dangerous                                 but at the same time not pretending that                                 we can ignore licenses                                 so yeah the message is getting better                                 that's encouraging thanks and we have a                                 question also from lawrence                                 about the self-certification process he                                 asks if there's any approval given                                 by the open chain project itself at the                                 end of that self-serve process                                 nope nothing i mean you just tell us                                 you're self-certified and that's it and                                 there is actually a reason for that                                 we purposefully decided to use economics                                 to police the standard                                 okay so ultimately it's a supply chain                                 standard if you are a company in the                                 supply chain and you self-certify                                 now your customer companies know they                                 can ask you for the section six                                 materials to see what you did                                 so the fact is that if you're                                 self-certified if you're talking about                                 it                                 at some point in the commercial                                 agreements your customers will say                                 okay show me the what we call the                                 compliance artifacts                                 so this is how we use the economics to                                 do it we don't spend a lot of money our                                 budget is                                 at the moment it's                                                   each                                         a year and that means there's no way we                                 could do something like                                 audit companies on our own but the                                 economic                                 uh audit has been super effective you                                 know suppliers                                 are very happy to be open chain                                 conformant but                                 i've never met a supplier which was                                 blase about it                                 uh that you know was not aware that at                                 any minute a customer could say                                 show me the artifacts                                 and so you've just been discussing there                                 like suppliers and                                 contract law which mandates the use of                                 open chain                                 is that the primary or only use case                                 because i'm thinking of startups or                                 smaller organizations or maybe even open                                 source projects who are                                 compliant but they may not have                                 contracts to enforce this either                                 their compliance or the compliance of                                 other organizations they may have                                 partnerships with yes                                 uh so i think when it comes to the                                 supply chain you basically have                                 the sales cycle which is more of your                                 advertising copy so companies like wind                                 river saying we're open chain conformant                                 you've procurement cycle which is likely                                 to go into contracts                                 but we see open chain used in merger and                                 acquisitions                                 so both in terms of let's see what this                                 company has in process and                                 also i've noticed in terms of let's                                 negotiate down their price if they made                                 mistakes                                 which is again good because it's in the                                 economics once it gets there it doesn't                                 go away                                 but it can also apply to projects and                                 actually we're noodling on                                 uh digging further into open chain for                                 projects it's perfectly viable it's just                                 a series of process points                                 and uh we there are standards like cii                                 best practices badge which                                 is security biased and quite detailed                                 uh but we think there might be value for                                 projects in having the                                 process inflection points and ultimately                                 final upstream is probably where we                                 should land                                 so speaking to your previous answer                                 jamie clark asks for                                 uh yeah he's asking about the general                                 negativity in the corporate realm                                 towards open source which is quite                                 historical and i'm sure open chain has                                 already done a lot to                                 to help with because of providing these                                 clear standards and getting them                                 certified                                 uh by iso do you have anything to say                                 about that from your own perspective                                 about uh                                 turning around negativity and fear i                                 actually do                                 i have not encountered any significant                                 amount of corporate negativity towards                                 open source                                 and this is ideal with many hundreds of                                 companies uh what i find                                 is that there's often a disconnect where                                 open source developers fear that                                 companies are up to something                                 and for the most part companies are up                                 to trying to work out how to use this                                 fast and cheap                                 so it's i i have not encountered                                 corporate negativity towards open source                                 with the exception of                                                    dealing with banks or                                 you know telcos which had no idea what                                 this was                                 but i i can't think of a single company                                 i've bumped into in the last five years                                 that's negative i have met companies                                 that are confused                                 but that's a different story so i think                                 we need to get rid of that we need to                                 get rid of the idea of this                                 war between developers and companies                                 it's not real                                 um if it is i would have seen it in                                 action                                 i'm confident of saying that because i                                 deal with so many companies                                 but i get it developers don't have great                                 channels into companies                                 and without that misunderstandings occur                                 and                                 the blame is that we don't have the                                 perfect meeting place between companies                                 and developers                                 yet i mean linux foundation has events                                 we've got events like fosdem                                 but we don't have a great bridge between                                 corporate management                                 and high-level independent developers i                                 would love to work on that in the future                                 that would have to be outside of open                                 chain though                                 what might that bridge look like would                                 it be technical tooling processes                                 or or what how do you imagine that                                 there was a wonderful comment from an                                 elderly japanese man who was asked how                                 do we                                 stop war and he said we have our                                 children play together                                 i think if we had conferences with high                                 level developers                                 independent developers and high level                                 management executives                                 i think that would work i don't think it                                 would work just everyone gets together                                 and there's                                               but if we brought together the right                                 minds i think that would fix it because                                 people would suddenly realize that                                 there's no                                 real barrier except they don't meet                                 you
