Title: #FOSSBack: George DeMet - Thorny Problems in Open Source Community Management
Publication date: 2021-03-01
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Since 2013, the Drupal Community Working Group (CWG) has been responsible for helping to foster a welcoming community for the project and upholding its code of conduct.  In this session, longtime CWG group member George DeMet will discuss some of the more challenging issues and problems the group has faced in its nearly 8-year history, such as:



- Addressing known community issues and conflicts in the absence of formal incident reports.
 - Defining the boundaries of "community" when it comes to behavior on social media and in other venues not under the explicit jurisdiction of the project.

 - Issues involved with enforcing event bans across a global community.

 - Determining how, if , and when banned individuals are allowed to re-engage with the community.


This session is for representatives of projects that already have codes of conduct and know how to enforce and uphold them, but are interested in finding ways to address issues and problems that don't have obvious answers.

                           uh my name is george met i use he him                                pronouns you can follow me on twitter at                                g

outside of chicago                                uh please do not confuse us with another                                company with a very similar name                                remember we're the ones with dot net and                                that's important                                uh so as i mentioned before um i was one                                of the founding members                                of the drupal community working group's                                conflict resolution team                                uh so we started the group uh we were                                chartered in                                     and um i actually just stepped down                                last month after serving for eight years                                to make way for fresh talent and                                leadership on the team                                however i continue to remain involved                                with the group as part of                                the community health team uh which is                                a group that we created uh within the                                community working group to                                work on kind of proactive fit measures                                to help                                improve community health uh health uh                                things that would go beyond                                just sort of code of conduct enforcement                                and conflict resolution                                so i continue to be remain involved                                there i'm also                                still very much in communication with                                the other members of the conflict                                resolution team                                helping out on issues where i might have                                some                                institutional knowledge or for issues                                that have been going on for                                some time i                                have a lot of experience in the drupal                                community over the last decade or so                                um of relevance to this talk is that um                                i was also one of the co-authors                                of uh the original version of                                uh drupal's code of conduct that's used                                for events uh it's gone through a few                                uh iterations uh since uh i think                                     or so but                                i i've been involved every step of the                                way so                                um just to provide a little bit of                                context and background for drupal for                                those who may not be familiar with the                                project uh                                we are one of the largest uh independent                                open source                                projects in the world and what i mean by                                independent open source projects                                is that uh drupal does not uh have a                                corporate sponsor                                uh it's not uh run by                                you know a large foundation that makes                                decisions about                                code and contribution we are an                                independent open source project we do                                have a non-profit that provides a lot of                                support for the project                                but they typically don't get involved in                                sort of uh product direction                                 we have uh tens of thousands of active                                 contributors                                 and that can range anywhere from folks                                 who are                                 working on issues and contributing code                                 on drupal.org which is our

longevity to it so the way                                 that we do community management and                                 again when i'm talking about community                                 management here i'm                                 you know it's fairly loose um                                 you know but we have a community code of                                 conduct                                 that is maintained and enforced by a                                 volunteer team                                 that's the community working group or                                 the cwg                                 the oversight for that group is provided                                 by members of                                 community elected members of the                                 of the board of trustees of the drupal                                 association which is that nonprofit                                 which helps run drupal.org which                                 provides a lot of                                 assistance and support to the project                                 runs the                                 annual some by semi-annual                                 drupalcon conferences and                                 also you know is really that place to                                 make sure things on the project and                                 community are running smoothly so they                                 have two members on their board of                                 directors                                 that are directly elected by members of                                 the community                                 so those two members of the board along                                 with                                 an independent representative from a                                 different open source project who's                                 selected by the board at large that                                 group of three people                                 provide the oversight for the community                                 working groups                                 conflict resolution team they uh                                 you know they have to sign off on any                                 members that are added to the team                                 if there is an issue that needs to be                                 appealed to a higher body                                 they're the ones who review that and so                                 uh the the independent representative on                                 uh on that group right now is actually                                 john o'bacon who's                                 i think a lot of folks probably here                                 probably know who he is                                 um and uh you know fortunately um                                 we don't uh keep that group too busy we                                 haven't kept that group too busy                                 um and uh yeah but it that's that sort                                 of level of accountability and support                                 so                                 um as i mentioned before uh we have our                                 semi-annual conferences                                 one typically in north america one                                 typically                                 in europe and um they have their own                                 event code of conduct um that that goes                                 into                                 kind of more specifics around issues                                 that would be associated with                                 in-person um or now virtual events and                                 that                                 is enforced directly by the paid staff                                 of the drupal association                                 and then we also have uh you know a lot                                 of                                 local community organizations all over                                 the world                                 uh and they often run their own events                                 you know drupal camps                                 and those are largely run independently                                 um                                 and will have their own uh code of                                 conduct                                 and their own enforcement mechanisms                                 within                                 within those local communities one of                                 the things                                 that we've done to help provide                                 additional support                                 for those for those local communities                                 and for those independent events is we                                 actually do code of conduct enforcement                                 training it's a workshop that's provided                                 by sage sharp                                 and we strongly encourage anyone who is                                 running a local event to have at least                                 one person on their organizing team                                 who has been through that training by                                 sage                                 so that's the kind of little bit of a                                 background uh you know                                 about where i'm coming from the                                 experience and perspective                                 that i'm bringing to um what we're                                 talking about today and                                 you know what i really wanted to do you                                 know in the in the sort of brief time we                                 have together                                 is uh go through some of                                 sort of the the most challenging and                                 sort of sticky and complicated issues                                 that we've run up against                                 um over the uh last eight years and i'm                                 going to talk about them sort of as as                                 an abstract we've seen                                 kind of clusters of issues around these                                 sort of                                 problem spaces as i'm going to refer to                                 it so                                 dive right in problem number one is                                 harassment that occurs outside of                                 community spaces                                 uh so the the situation here right                                 is that um you know online harassment                                 uh particularly on social media has                                 become a huge issue especially in the                                 last few years                                 um and you have folks who feel that no                                 matter what they do or say                                 outside of a project space it's only                                 their behavior                                 within the project space that should                                 matter and in fact you know                                 we a lot of the very popular open source                                 codes of conduct                                 you know one of them actually is the                                 contributor covenant i absolutely love                                 the contributor covenant                                 in almost every respect but one                                 challenge i                                 have is that it does you know restrict                                 scope to                                 community spaces or individuals who are                                 officially representing the community in                                 some way                                 um the issue with that                                 is that things like brigading cyber                                 bullying                                 other forms of harassment very often                                 against marginalized members of the                                 community                                 but not exclusively usually occur or                                 originate on social media                                 and other places that are outside of                                 community control                                 right and as i look at it you know                                 if you are you know harassing and                                 attacking                                 someone who is another member of your                                 community                                 on social media you cannot then turn                                 around and expect them to collaborate                                 with you in a project space and pretend                                 like nothing happened                                 right in recent years we've also seen                                 several cases where                                 you know we've had folks try to organize                                 anonymous harassment campaigns against                                 members of our community                                 and those are incredibly difficult to                                 address                                 especially when you know there's                                 insufficient evidence to sort of prove                                 who's behind them you can guess you have                                 suspicion you might have                                 um you know some little piece of                                 circumstantial evidence that might point                                 to                                 a person or group of folks who might be                                 involved                                 but you know uh you don't have                                 you know what what we would call the                                 smoking gun piece of evidence                                 and you know and of course the issue                                 we've also seen                                 uh is that you know you can report                                 harassment and abuse                                 um all you want but very often uh you                                 know the platforms involved twitter                                 facebook what have you                                 won't take action uh unless it violates                                 their                                 um you know their rules in some very                                 particular way                                 you know the other the other issue is                                 that you know                                 uh public expressions of discriminatory                                 views or hate speech                                 by high profile community members also                                 have a negative impact on the community                                 even when they occur outside of                                 community spaces right so                                 i mean if if somebody who's a high                                 profile member of your community or a                                 leader in your community                                 is on their personal twitter saying                                 you know racist misogynistic transphobic                                 homophobic things                                 that is going to you know have an impact                                 on your community it's going to reflect                                 poorly on your community                                 and that is something that needs to be                                 addressed in some way shape or form                                 so this next slide for this particular                                 problem i talk about some possible                                 solutions                                 these are some things that we've tried                                 this is not                                 comprehensive nor will the possible                                 solutions i present for any of these                                 problems be comprehensive                                 they're just some of the things that                                 we've tried to address them they may or                                 may not be helpful for you in your                                 community                                 so first and foremost in drupal we                                 define the scope of our community fairly                                 broadly to include interactions between                                 community members                                 regardless of venue right and we do have                                 to carve out some exceptions here                                 because                                 you could have two people who are                                 members of the same community and who                                 have a dispute                                 um that is not related to the project                                 you know                                 if it's uh a workplace dispute obviously                                 that is                                 not a place where the community can get                                 involved that is                                 that is handled elsewhere um                                 and uh you know but beyond that you know                                 we really are                                 you know and we had an issue uh that we                                 came up with last year where                                 that we had last year where there was                                 somebody who um was                                 who was engaging in some uh some                                 harassment within a community space                                 and then also um following up                                 with more a more intense level of                                 harassment                                 uh via social media um you know so                                 you know so in that case like we had to                                 can we did                                 consider the entirety of that person's                                 um                                 interactions when deciding what next                                 what next steps to take                                 um so this really goes to the next point                                 which is focusing on the impact                                 of an individual's words or actions                                 rather than when or where they occurred                                 or what their intent were you get a lot                                 of folks who are like oh i didn't mean                                 that i was just joking etc                                 the bottom line is that you have to                                 focus on the impact                                 and that and that you need to make it                                 really clear in your in your community                                 that                                 folks do need to hold themselves                                 responsible                                 for their words and actions and the                                 impact they have on others                                 um so to the third point here right                                 you know i want to be really clear                                 people can have whatever political views                                 they want we do not want to be in a                                 position                                 we will not be in a position where we're                                 doing any kind of policing a political                                 speech of individuals in our community                                 but again you know if somebody is saying                                 something publicly expressing a view                                 right and publicly expressing a view is                                 not just holding that view                                 that's taking an action um and                                 and when you go to that step you know                                 where you're taking an action you are                                 responsible and accountable for it and                                 um                                 you know and if you are saying something                                 that is going to fundamentally undermine                                 your                                 ability to collaborate with other people                                 in your community                                 that is something that you need to be                                 you know to take responsibility for                                 right                                 and if you're not willing to take                                 responsibility for the things you say                                 and do                                 then you need to understand that there                                 may be additional consequences as a                                 result                                 all right problem number two                                 handling unreported incidents so what                                 this is really talking about here                                 um are situations where uh                                 you know there is something um                                 bad that has happened uh you know maybe                                 a                                 an incident of harassment or abuse                                 um but no one is really willing or                                 comfortable                                 to report it uh so you know what we see                                 is that                                 uh you know there may be rumors about an                                 incident or an alleged harasser that's                                 circulating                                 uh in informal back channels and uh                                 whisper networks right                                 um but that the folks who are                                 responsible                                 whether it's code of conduct authorities                                 or whoever within the community                                 may not have been provided with enough                                 information or may not have enough                                 information from those networks                                 in order to be able to take action right                                 we                                 also see that people may be                                 reluctant to file reports of harassment                                 or abuse that they have                                 either seen or experienced because                                 they're afraid                                 that they might get blamed for actions                                 any actions taken against the harasser                                 no matter what steps are taken to                                 protect their identity                                 or they may see they may be concerned                                 that they might get someone else in                                 trouble                                 as a result of filing a report so the                                 consequence of this is                                 actually really really bad um uh                                 you know it is if if there are other                                 community members out there who are                                 aware                                 uh that an incident of harassment or                                 abuse has occurred and                                 knows that people are talking about it                                 but does not see any action being taken                                 by you know the code of conduct                                 enforcement folks or other uh                                 responsible folks in the community                                 they may lose faith uh in the                                 community's willingness or ability to                                 to address these kinds of issues right                                 and                                 so that is is something again that can                                 really kind of fundamentally                                 undermine sort of the level of trust and                                 psychological safety you have in your                                 community                                 so um possible solutions                                 we allow enough folks to file anonymous                                 informal reports                                 we are very open with about                                 how reports are handled what information                                 will and will not be shared publicly                                 we are very clear that information                                 circulated on whisper networks is not                                 in on of its own actionable may need to                                 be corroborated                                 and then to try and gain that additional                                 information                                 we communicate directly privately and                                 discreetly with those                                 who might have second hand knowledge of                                 an incident i.e that somebody                                 who may not have been involved directly                                 involved in the incident                                 but who may have observed it or heard                                 about it from someone who is involved                                 to try and gain additional information                                 and also as a way                                 of helping those who have been involved                                 understand                                 what is being done to address the                                 you know what they've experienced all                                 right so                                 i am moving very quickly now for the                                 next three problems enforcing event bans                                 um you know a lot of open source                                 communities are very decentralized                                 uh event organizers don't talk to each                                 other so that means that                                 events may not always be in local                                 communities may not always be aware that                                 a person has been banned from attending                                 or speaking                                 at other community events you also have                                 events that might be aware but choose to                                 invite a banned person to speak or                                 attend because they don't agree with the                                 reasons that they were banned i was                                 speaking with someone from another open                                 source community earlier this week where                                 they had this same thing happen someone                                 who was very outspoken and was saying a                                 lot of very destructive things within                                 the community                                 had been banned from speaking at                                 official events so they just went and                                 started speaking at a bunch of                                 unofficial events                                 um one of the uh things that we're                                 seeing right now                                 with virtual events is it's a lot easier                                 for people to evade bands they register                                 under a false name and email they                                 turn off their camera and they                                 surreptitiously show up and sometimes                                 you know cause trouble we also have                                 debated                                 a long time back and forth whether it's                                 possible to publish or                                 share a list of individuals who have                                 been banned                                 where we are currently coming down in                                 the drupal community is that we're not                                 able to do that for a variety of reasons                                 but it's an ongoing conversation                                 so possible solutions making it really                                 clear                                 to folks who have been banned from                                 physical events that the ban also                                 extends to virtual ones                                 making it really clear what the                                 consequences are for evading a ban                                 and we also allow event organizers who                                 have concerns that they might                                 inadvertently invite a band person                                 to submit to share the list of attendees                                 with us                                 we can review that if we see someone on                                 the list who shouldn't be there                                 we will reach out directly to that                                 person we will not involve the event                                 organizer we'll reach out to regular                                 person say hey                                 you were banned you need to withdraw                                 right away and                                 they will do that and                                 some communities may be able to take                                 action against events that deliberately                                 invite banned speakers right                                 removal of the project name or other                                 kinds of support so i want to get to                                 this last                                 point right here because this is a                                 really important one accountability                                 redemption and reconciliation                                 so this is the question of folks who                                 have been banned                                 is there a way back a path back to                                 re-engagement with the community right                                 and this is such a difficult issue                                 because                                 very often damage that's caused by an                                 individual's bad behavior                                 has an impact on the entire community                                 not just those who are directly involved                                 and that means that in order to                                 repair that damage an individual needs                                 to not only undergo a personal                                 transformation                                 and they need to not just be sorry for                                 what they've done but they need to be                                 willing                                 and able to rebuild trust and hold                                 themselves accountable                                 for their past behavior and even if                                 all of that occurs you will very likely                                 have some community members who will                                 object to any previously banned                                 individual                                 being allowed to return under any                                 circumstances                                 so when this comes up um we are very                                 upfront with banned individuals that the                                 path back is not an easy one                                 there will be setbacks uh bef we talk                                 with people                                 who know the banned individual to assess                                 the level and sincerity of their                                 personal transformation                                 before we take any action we talk with                                 those who are most directly impacted by                                 the individual's past behavior                                 if all of those passes a sniff test                                 if everyone is okay with it we start                                 small we let the individual                                 re-engage with the community a very                                 limited way doesn't work out you can                                 always pull the plug                                 and we just are prepared for the                                 individual to walk away from the process                                 if they counter resistance it's very                                 disappointing because there's a lot that                                 folks can invest and they're like you                                 know what                                 this is too much turns out i can't                                 handle it i need to just walk away okay                                 we'll be here when you're ready i want                                 to close with this quote                                 from bell hooks which summarizes kind of                                 a lot                                 of what i was just talking about in that                                 last slide                                 and informed a lot of what we did during                                 my tenure on the drupal community                                 working group which is                                 uh for me forgiveness and compassion are                                 always                                 linked right how do we hold people                                 accountable for wrongdoing and yet                                 at the same time remain in touch with                                 their humanity                                 enough to believe in their capacity to                                 be transformed                                 so with that thank you                                 um i don't know if we have any time for                                 any questions                                 but if we do i am here and uh                                 willing to answer them                                 yes thanks george um we actually still                                 had a lot of time but                                 not so many questions okay                                 but um yeah then i can at least make a                                 comment um sure i really liked your your                                 point about                                 um what happens after the band like how                                 can someone                                 maybe get back into the community or not                                 under which circumstances that something                                 that's often overlooked                                 often ends with how to enforce the                                 guidelines                                 yeah it is it is really hard um we've                                 had                                 um you know we've had a couple people                                 try it um                                 and you know in and i would say we're                                 probably batting                                 uh maybe you know                                                 in terms of of success um you know and                                 and i think a lot of it has to do with                                 the scope of the and severity of the                                 incident that got you banned in the                                 first place                                 um you know so if you're somebody who                                 has an established history                                 of you know just being a difficult                                 person for many years and causing a lot                                 of people a lot of grief                                 i think that is going to be a much                                 harder road to climb because you're                                 gonna have to rebuild trust and                                 connections                                 with so many people uh including a bunch                                 of people who you never even knew                                 you were hurting in the first place um                                 so that's really really hard                                 um i think if you're somebody who um                                 you know who who made a few mistakes                                 um then um you know and                                 and those mistakes were were fairly                                 limited                                 and you know and you really are able                                 to demonstrate like look that was the                                 person i                                 was then this is the person i am now                                 here are the ways in which i've grown                                 and transformed and changed this person                                 and how i want to repair that damage um                                 there's a little more hope there                                 yes okay um i think there are no more                                 questions in the                                 uh chat or questions tool um but maybe                                 someone um                                 has a more uh in-depth or private                                 question they want to discuss                                 in the breakout room so um and i just                                 want to i just want to give a call out                                 um                                 you know if there is anyone out there
