	                              as                               as advertised i'm going to talk about                               building and managing communities                               but i also want to acknowledge that                               communities of                               uh open source projects are very                               different today than they were                               even five years ago or                                                                                           so there is a conversation to be had                                about how did we get here                                and where do we want to go from here so                                i've                                brought together two different types of                                talks here                                and i want to get your feedback on                                all of this information and so on so                                please liberally use the chat                                liberally use the emoji reactions and                                come have a conversation with me after                                this                                so how did we get to this state in                                community life right now                                and how did we how do we want to move                                forward                                so one of the things that i think is                                very important is to realize that your                                communities                                are the people that are in them they                                are the communities they they are the                                communities that are built                                by the people that are participating in                                them and this if this isn't an argument                                for more diversity inside your project                                and more perspectives and more views                                inside your project                                i cannot possibly see a better one                                we want our open source community these                                communities to be open and inclusive                                and that means that the people who are                                active in them                                have to look like the people we are also                                trying to attract                                i don't know how many of you know ross                                gardler he uh is a longtime apache                                person                                and was one of their leadership and on                                their board for a long time                                and this was just a great offhand quote                                that he said                                uh in a meeting and it was it was                                too good to leave there so                                if this is our starting point the                                community is the people that is                                that are inside it and the people who                                are most active and that's what sets the                                culture                                then for those of you who are part of                                uh us culture you should be able to                                recognize this                                there we go now and clicked on the                                correct                                window you should be able to recognize                                this gentleman this is john f kennedy                                and in one of his most famous speeches                                he said ask                                not what you can do for your country or                                ask not what your country can do for you                                but what you can do for your country and                                that in a lot of cases                                is how you have to start your engagement                                in communities                                so many of you are open source community                                long time contributors developers uh                                people who are working on the project in                                other roles that                                may be broader than just committing code                                and                                all of these contributions all of this                                that you are doing for your community                                is what actually creates it community by                                itself                                is just a word community is the people                                that are inside it                                so how do we go from here                                and what do we want to do about it                                first and absolutely everyone of you who                                are here                                in this conversation today know this                                first you have to show up there's a                                really fun story here because                                early in my career i knew that i needed                                to go to                                meetups and i knew i needed to get into                                this community thing and this networking                                thing because i needed to meet more                                people                                and i'm an introvert totally admit it                                and i hated them                                 i hated going to meetups i hated um                                 i hated having to go in schmooze and                                 i realized that i didn't feel as if i                                 had a place                                 or a part in any of these communities or                                 in any in any of these groups                                 and so i would cancel or i'd get a                                 little bit anxious and i wouldn't want                                 to go                                 and or occasionally i will admit i got                                 to the venue it was too much of a hassle                                 to park i went home                                 so these are the kinds of resistances                                 that we find to showing up so in my case                                 i am a chronic hand raiser so i decided                                 that i would run these meetups                                 because if i had a responsibility and i                                 had a thing i needed to do                                 then i would be there and i would do my                                 thing and then i would have reasons to                                 talk to people                                 so this is a super cool excuse to get                                 people involved in your project                                 recognize that they're there                                 recognize that they may feel as if                                 they're an outsider they may not                                 understand how they fit and give them a                                 job                                 it's so straightforward and it makes                                 people feel so                                 deeply included and deeply seen it may                                 feel                                 awkward or it may feel                                 to actually say hey uh                                 can i get you to go do this thing or                                 would you review these slides or this                                 document                                 in our non-uh physical world but                                 that outreach can be huge because                                 for people who aren't automatically a                                 hand raiser if you can go out and tap                                 them                                 and say hey you have a place in this                                 community i need your help here                                 then you draw them in that much further                                 another piece of                                 learning that i have taken away from my                                 years in community is                                 on top of making sure i show up and                                 finding whatever way it is                                 that gets me to show up                                 you also need to develop values for that                                 community                                 and these aren't the sort of touchy                                 feely snuggly values i really just                                 wanted to use that image                                 but these are values that you as a                                 company or as a project                                 or as a company can use to make your                                 decisions                                 so they aren't you know we we believe in                                 integrity                                 okay but really who doesn't and if you                                 didn't believe in integrity would you                                 actually put that on your website like                                 this just doesn't seem                                 same to me so let's develop values for                                 your community or your project                                 that you can use to make decisions i                                 give an example here because                                 it's straightforward um the values that                                 the kubernetes community devised                                 and this is a lot through the organic                                 growth of the community and how the                                 community was acting                                 that we then chose to codify as values                                 and these are our values it's pretty                                 straightforward we actually say                                 if i need to make a decision is the                                 community                                 the the children you know how is the                                 community affected in this choice and                                 how is                                 the single company of maybe this                                 decision or the group of companies that                                 may be involved in this decision how are                                 they                                 engaged because in large scale projects                                 you're not always                                 working just with individuals you're                                 often                                 working with companies or the vps behind                                 the people that you're talking to                                 and you don't always understand their                                 motivations or their                                 engagement and how they want to                                 participate in this                                 but you as an in an individual                                 working in your open source community                                 have that trust and authenticity                                 and transparency passing through                                 you and your credibility and                                 responsibility                                 are part of this conversation                                 as well so our first value when making                                 choices                                 if it's a choice between doing something                                 that provides more value for the                                 community or more value for a single                                 company or a small group of companies                                 we choose the community we choose to                                 make all of our work distributed instead                                 of centralized                                 and that in this case means our decision                                 making as well                                 so within kubernetes early early on                                 the decisions were all blocked and gated                                 on what would google answer or how can i                                 find the right googler to say yes to                                 this                                 and that really was damaging to the                                 community                                 how many of you have been stuck in a                                 position or a                                 community where you can't quite find                                 the can't quite find the right person to                                 ask for permission                                 except that maybe you don't need                                 permission but it's not clear okay                                 emojis again                                 please let me know over on the other                                 screen i bet some of you have                                 felt this kubernetes also said that                                 improvement is better than stagnation so                                 we're not always going to get it right                                 not every change is going to be right                                 but                                 waiting and sitting still is also not an                                 option                                 and then of course um having come out of                                 google and with the                                 super strong sre background there                                 automation                                 is better than toil where toil equals a                                 process in a human doing something                                 so these are our decision-making                                 criteria                                 should we put this patch in let's go                                 back does it look at does it                                 react or does the community benefit more                                 than the company or does the company                                 benefit more than the community                                 are we moving to make this more                                 decentralized and distributed                                 are we moving to make this a better                                 project and are we always trying to find                                 places to automate and reduce toil                                 so those were our values that we                                 developed and we didn't do this in a                                 brainstorming                                 thinking session we did this as a                                 community                                 the first year or so as we worked                                 together we                                 were finding these values we were                                 finding what was important to the                                 community                                 and then we had to codify it and                                 sometimes                                 we didn't get to see those things or see                                 what made the community special                                 until we talked to people who felt as if                                 they weren't part of that community                                 and saw what they aspired to saw what                                 they wanted from the community                                 asked them what was important to them                                 asked them                                 how we could better support them in the                                 community                                 and then making sure that that feedback                                 is incorporated                                 over and over and over                                 because incorporating that feedback is                                 one of the behaviors                                 that you really want to reward in open                                 source                                 open source is this fantastic                                 uh space world uh                                 culture that is very different                                 from a classic corporate culture or even                                 a social culture                                 it's kind of somewhere between which is                                 very neat and we're incredibly lucky to                                 be able to work in that space                                 but that also means that you don't have                                 many of the traditional                                 motivators so most of the people that i                                 find in open source                                 are either better at intrinsic                                 motivation motivation coming up from                                 inside themselves                                 or have learned like myself how to put                                 that intrinsic motivation                                 in there by volunteering to relieve the                                 meetup for example                                 now i have an extrinsic motivation i                                 need to be there to open the doors or                                 there is no meetup                                 so i'll be there but you want to reward                                 the behaviors that you want to encourage                                 so if you see someone you know stepping                                 up and triaging                                 uh issues without being asked                                 that's the kind of thing not to just say                                 wow thanks                                 susie you did a great job coming in and                                 working on that                                 but to say to the whole of the community                                 this was an excellent act of leadership                                 she                                 may have you know feedback after having                                 gone through and done this great                                 you know triage work and maybe we can                                 set up                                 a group that can work on this more often                                 going forward there's a great ruth peter                                 ginsberg quote around this which is                                 fight for the things that you find                                 important but                                 do it in a way that others will join you                                 i also talk about this as the tom sawyer                                 hook                                 finn um fence painting act in open                                 source                                 in open source when you're super excited                                 about things and you can relate                                 and participate and engage with someone                                 empathetically you can actually find                                 ways                                 that align your interests with theirs                                 and get a better outcome for the whole                                 project                                 you can align interests you develop                                 things together you have those different                                 perspectives coming in you're being                                 empathetic                                 everybody is feeling as if they're                                 safe in this space and                                 you get lots of productivity this is the                                 whole one plus one doesn't equal two                                 aspect of open source because if i                                 sat and developed a thing or wrote a                                 thing all by myself                                 and then tried to publish it on the web                                 having done this in in english not your                                 traditional coding language but having                                 done this in english a number of times                                 i always value the                                 feedback that i get from my peers and                                 the empathy with which they give it to                                 me                                 so that i can learn and grow and that                                 makes the whole                                 procedure and the whole process of                                 creating content or developing a product                                 or negotiating how we're going to market                                 something                                 among different companies all of that                                 requires empathy                                 and requires that we are focused on                                 the people that we're working with as                                 well as                                 the project outcomes it's also the whole                                 point in the kubernetes value of the                                 community needs to be                                 first before the company in order to                                 make sure that the project as a whole                                 is strong saying all that                                 you really also need to make space for                                 creativity in your community                                 this can happen in a number of ways in                                 the most mundane way                                 one of the places open source falls down                                 in comparison to proprietary                                 project product is                                 in fact that we have worst ui in ux                                 so how about we start embracing creative                                 designers                                 and embracing people who can work with                                 us on on ui flow because not                                 every end user is going to have the same                                 concept and comfort with the ui                                 that may be perfectly intuitive to the                                 person who wrote it                                 so that's one aspect of making space for                                 creativity making sure that we                                 bring creatives who can help us make                                 our projects even more appealing and                                 even more                                 uh intuitive and useful decreasing mean                                 time to dopamine the first time you're                                 playing with the project                                 make space for those people in our                                 projects make space for the                                 the visual and the um participatory for                                 our customers                                 or for our end users and then of course                                 there's another aspect which is make                                 space for creativity and fun within the                                 community                                 in the second half of my talk i'm gonna                                 actually offer a couple                                 of examples of that and how it happened                                 spontaneously in the kubernetes                                 community because we made space                                 for it so of course you've worked in                                 open source long enough                                 you know that offering help                                 and participating with your community                                 engaging with them                                 and encouraging them as opposed to                                 shutting them down                                 is always the best path toward                                 a happy healthy community that                                 then through example begins                                 helping and growing other people in the                                 project                                 so for every one of the people that you                                 take under your wing as a leader in an                                 open source project                                 and you coach and you mentor a little                                 bit and you empower                                 more than anything that you empower them                                 in the project                                 those people become our next generation                                 of contributors                                 those people become our next generation                                 of leaders and that                                 is the best legacy that we can leave a                                 project                                 is making sure that we are not central                                 to it                                 i as an individual never wanted to be                                 central to the                                 kubernetes community it was occasionally                                 the person that said oh you have to                                 connect you those two people have to                                 connect or whatever                                 but i never wanted to be the only person                                 that could do a thing                                 or the only person who could make a                                 decision and that                                 through empowerment of everyone around                                 you is the biggest help                                 for your project to develop succession                                 good leadership a strong bench                                 in case someone gets ill and more                                 resilient as a project                                 to that end since we are presuming we                                 are not forever going to be leading the                                 project that we're working on right now                                 or we're not forever going to be uh                                 working on the project that we're                                 leading now                                 there has to be a way to document                                 decision making some projects run                                 decision records                                 just if the just if a decision is made                                 it gets written down in a decision                                 record and who was there the time when                                 the decision was made                                 this accountability is incredibly                                 important                                 i've used this same image on a slide                                 before to talk about shadowy power                                 structures                                 and that is very much why you want to be                                 documenting decision making                                 it's very much why you want to                                 understand who can make decisions                                 and when something is just a decision                                 for                                 the community to discuss and and come to                                 consensus                                 because of course open source on the                                 whole runs by consensus                                 acceptor until you run into a bdfl                                 okay so this is another thing that                                 should be pretty straightforward to you                                 all measure what matters                                 use that information to go ahead and                                 improve your project and                                 seek out new perspectives where you know                                 you're not having                                 and meeting the needs of your users                                 by whatever measurement or key objective                                 you've set                                 within open source of course                                 i like to set up my projects so that no                                 matter who's participating in them                                 they're being stretched in a way that                                 is not comfortable to them because that                                 discomfort                                 is learning in a lot of cases i'm not                                 saying make people                                 feel uncomfortable that's different but                                 i'm saying                                 make sure that people are not only being                                 an                                 expert and offering uh you know                                 experiences from the past and exp you                                 know offering the wisdom of my years in                                 this open source                                 but that they're also growing that                                 they're also learning                                 in kubernetes in a lot of cases we were                                 working                                 on what fundamentally was management                                 skills                                 in some of the leadership uh                                 conversations we were working on                                 negotiation skills                                 you know you bring a bunch of staff                                 suites together there's nothing in                                 leading a project                                 that i'm going to teach them about                                 engineering but                                 it turns out the community isn't made of                                 just code it's actually made of                                 engineers and                                 engineers still need to be thought of                                 and engaged with as a whole person                                 so there's a huge need to make sure that                                 your your team your leadership and your                                 project                                 broadly are always always learning                                 and then teaching because it is so much                                 harder to teach                                 something than it is to think you know                                 you understand it                                 so i recommend the next time you think                                 you really understand a topic                                 in your code or in your community                                 find a find a partner find a rubber duck                                 to talk to                                 and say let me explain this to you                                 because to try to deconstruct things in                                 a lot of cases in order to explain them                                 you will learn more and more                                 funny aside there i'm taking pilates                                 teacher training                                 so that i can deepen my own pilates                                 practice because i'm being taught how to                                 teach it                                 which means that i'm now learning even                                 better how to do it                                 another thing that we have to value and                                 reward                                 in that whole point about valuing and                                 rewarding the things that we                                 find important is doing                                 unglamorous work this is                                 the make or break point for your                                 community because if there is not a                                 culture                                 of doing the work that just needs to be                                 done                                 setting up cicd making sure there's test                                 coverage                                 making sure that the meetings are set up                                 for the next week and there's an agenda                                 making sure that the discussion points                                 um have been you know discussion points                                 around the technical                                 uh choices you're going to make have                                 been vetted inside your company as well                                 as                                 the the negotiation you know in                                 preparation for the negotiation                                 uh with the project but this                                 this is the thing that can actually kill                                 your project because                                 it can erode from the center if you're                                 not doing                                 the maintenance work that is just                                 gardening it's great if you want to go                                 out to your garden and you want to put                                 in                                 a whole new plant bed                                 and you're all set up in the beginning                                 of spring and that looks all super shiny                                 and cool                                 and then you have a garden open house                                 and then you have some neighbors come                                 through and then you invite more people                                 and you're working with more people in                                 your garden and you're actually maybe                                 going to build                                 a fence because you can get your whole                                 open source community to paint it for                                 you                                 but by this point if you haven't also                                 been                                 maintaining that garden you know pulling                                 out the weeds making sure that the                                 issues are groomed wait now i'm mixing                                 my metaphors making sure that                                 the beds of the plant beds are groomed                                 then you're not going to have a garden                                 that is appealing for people to continue                                 to come work in                                 so you need to find those people and you                                 need to make sure that they are                                 rewarded and you need to make sure that                                 everyone                                 is encouraged to do the hard work                                 that is maintenance of an open source                                 project                                 not the glamorous work of a release i                                 shouldn't say that releases a heavy lift                                 but not not the glamorous work of you                                 know the release                                 blog post but the                                 or the new feature that you committed                                 but the heavy lifting work                                 and the the work that needs to be done                                 in every project                                 just to try to stay ahead of the jungle                                 of                                 weeds and decay that happens to our code                                 as well                                 and our project more broadly                                 so i talk a lot i talked a lot about                                 culture                                 in this bit how to set it                                 how to engage with it how your community                                 will participate in your project and how                                 you can                                 engage with them and that i think                                 is such a stronger and more important                                 underpinning than necessarily having                                 a strategy that you can elucidate                                 all of that said strategy is important                                 strategy in your project is going to be                                 necessary you need to understand what                                 your companies who are participating                                 want you need to align interests you                                 need to leapfrog and think where this                                 project might be                                 in five years you need to look to where                                 that                                 goes you need to build like a cone of                                 projection                                 into the future and say if we're                                 starting from here                                 at the apex of the cone and we're trying                                 to go there                                 somewhere out in you know time                                 how do we make that navigation we know                                 it won't be the perfect path                                 so how do we keep ourselves bounded                                 within that strategic direction                                 that's super important                                 but i think sometimes people confuse                                 the strategy of the project with the                                 governance of the project                                 and the people spend a lot of time on                                 building the rules                                 around your project and making sure                                 that those rules are                                 game proof which they never will be and                                 especially in a group of engineers who                                 are built to problem solve if i say you                                 can't game this metric                                 what is the first thing you're all going                                 to go do                                 you're going to go try to find a way to                                 gain the metric because it's fine                                 someone told me i couldn't do a thing                                 someone told me it was a problem they                                 hadn't solved                                 so i propose a new framing on this                                 culture                                 quote culture                                 eats governance for breakfast                                 if any of you have any thoughts on this                                 i'm happy to hear them on twitter                                 i'm happy to hear them with emoji in the                                 in this um                                 video like i'm i'm just actually excited                                 about this is a fun way to describe this                                 but here's the thing if you don't                                 have trust in your organization                                 you won't have a good project                                 your project in your community will be                                 fraught                                 it may be an exceptional technical tool                                 but it may be massively toxic                                 it may be the most                                 accommodating community that never                                 ends up getting anything done there has                                 to be space                                 for trust and that trust is often given                                 before you have reason to know for sure                                 it's one of the reasons that the graph                                 that exists within open source is so                                 important                                 if i have someone who calls me up and                                 says                                 so you worked with this person on                                 another project                                 how was that and i can offer my                                 thoughts to offer commutative trust to                                 offer                                 my my level of trust with that person                                 to the person who is making the inquiry                                 who then can say with you know however                                 however high their confidence in my                                 perception is they can sort of put that                                 value                                 on what my perception is of the person                                 and you know maybe get a little leg up                                 on trusting them earlier because i trust                                 that person                                 so trust is one of the huge like largest                                 underpinnings of open source communities                                 without that trust                                 you're not going to be able to have a                                 successful project                                 and i want to say respect as well                                 and respect the noun here because                                 if we are not comfortable                                 and accepting and even embracing                                 the different views of people                                 as having value                                 just by different view and something we                                 can learn from                                 then we will be limiting and narrowing                                 our possibility to make a better                                 more inclusive more um                                 broadly applicable project and that may                                 be a goal                                 let's be clear there are totally times                                 when what you want to do is open source                                 a tiny little library you're willing to                                 run it for                                 on your own for you know the next                                    years                                 and that's great but we also find                                 that some of those tiny little libraries                                 end up                                 in infrastructure and end up                                 unmaintained many many years later                                 i think one of the classic examples that                                 we talk about is                                 uh ntp which there's a great article                                 where                                 the primary contributor who has run this                                 on his own little machine workstation                                 under his desk for like                                          his development his code his                                 project are                                 not as well engaged with or funded                                 but the internet runs on ntp                                 how else without clock sync could we                                 talk about                                 distributed compute i'm sure there's                                 another technical way                                 i would love to hear about it throw it                                 in the comments                                 and actually i think i do know what that                                 answer is but that's cool so respect is                                 a noun we need                                 to make sure that we have due regard                                 for the people and for the feelings and                                 wishes                                 and the rights and traditions of others                                 around us                                 so we can also use it to say respect man                                 that i want to draw a particular                                 attention to that                                 lots of respect so that's the noun                                 but as it turns out we aren't static as                                 humans                                 and so i want to introduce one more noun                                 that participates in this whole                                 conversation and that's vulnerability                                 we have to make it okay                                 in our communities to have a                                 conversation                                 to disagree and to still come to a                                 conclusion                                 we have to be able to in our communities                                 say i was hurt by that                                 can we look at doing it a different way                                 now hurt in this case maybe any number                                 of things it may be                                 i wasn't able to access your meetings                                 because they were at you know                                 a.m my time every week                                 that's a vulnerability and that's a                                 that's a point that this person is                                 saying is you know                                 by asking is it possible to move these                                 meetings                                 implicitly because that person didn't in                                 saying that ask                                 but by encouraging or offering that                                 it would be easier if we could also                                 have meetings at different times that                                 person                                 has taken a risk talking to a project                                 leader                                 talking to someone in the project saying                                 you know i'm not able to do this                                 because whatever the reason is whatever                                 this is                                 to say that takes vulnerability                                 and that vulnerability has to be                                 respected and this time i mean the verb                                 being able to engage with                                 the hard parts of our self yeah i can't                                 do something                                 or i'm scared because i don't know who                                 to talk to                                 or i have to understand and engage with                                 a new project                                 but i don't know anyone there there is                                 so                                 much activation energy                                 in trying to get into and participating                                 in a community                                 think about the last time that you                                 walked into a room                                 where you didn't know anyone                                 and tried to have a conversation let's                                 make it a big room let's pretend this is                                 before the pandemic                                 so we'll make it we'll make it at an                                 event                                 we'll sit at this event we've got a nice                                 little mixer going on                                 and you're supposed to go meet all the                                 people who are working on                                 all the different i don't know service                                 meshes in the world so this should be                                 really interesting right                                 but it's also really scary especially if                                 you don't know most of the people in the                                 room                                 i think some of us who work in open                                 source regularly                                 forget how terrifying                                 coming into a group that all knows each                                 other                                 that is making inside jokes and that                                 is behaving as                                 a unit that's scary to be the person on                                 the outside                                 so make sure that you can offer this                                 verb of respect                                 seek out the qualities that are new in                                 this person                                 seek out how you they can participate                                 show them that active respect                                 learn from them where their strengths                                 are                                 and then get them to help the project                                 participate                                 engage with them understand their needs                                 align                                 if they're aligned with the project see                                 if you can help them                                 and those needs as an individual might                                 be                                 career growth needs the way to get a                                 company involved in a project                                 different thing they need different                                 things                                 but they still in all of these cases                                 individual or company                                 need to be looked at with                                 enough respect and enough distance that                                 you can                                 see where their value is see that                                 the abilities that they have and the                                 qualities and achievements they've made                                 that will benefit the project                                 and it will benefit the community and                                 then                                 share those and share those in                                 an admirative way admirative admiring                                 way                                 share them in a oh you need to connect                                 with this person                                 because they've been looking for your                                 your type of skills                                 way help them find their place in the                                 community                                 because of course people are messy                                 and that includes everyone who is a                                 leader                                 that includes everyone who is showing up                                 for the first time with a first you know                                 one character typo pull request                                 humans are messy and so we have to spend                                 i would argue as much or more time                                 working                                 on making our projects work smoothly                                 than making code and i'll i'll make this                                 argument                                 and it's it's interesting because i've                                 had this conversation a number of times                                 inside companies as well as in open                                 source projects                                 and one of the big challenges that                                 people who have only worked within tight                                 company organizations                                 uh have done one of the challenges they                                 have                                 is that they are used to a whole lot of                                 undocumented tribal knowledge                                 expectations                                 and framework around them when they come                                 to an open source project                                 a lot of that is not there and that is                                 uncomfortable                                 so it causes people                                 to feel that discomfort and then we get                                 back to people being messy and needing                                 to be                                 respected and understood engaged with                                 and empathized                                 so self-organization works for small                                 groups um                                 this is pretty straightforward you give                                 a small group of you know six or eight                                 or ten                                 people who are participating in a                                 breakout meet um                                 meeting some autonomy and                                 encourage them to do fun things and next                                 thing you know you have                                 hats happening in leadership in                                 leadership meetings now                                 this happened organically and i've seen                                 it go wrong                                 when it doesn't happen organically i                                 once had a vp                                 tell us that to his qbr we were all                                 supposed to wear                                 crazy hats how many people do you think                                 wore crazy hats                                 not even the vp                                 so enforced fun is not fun organic fun                                 is fun and you can self-organize to have                                 organic fun                                 self-organization does not work with a                                 power differential                                 like this if this is the one thing that                                 i have to                                 like drive home with you all                                 self-organization                                 doesn't work with a power differential                                 so you really                                 really need to make sure that you are                                 working with people and you are working                                 with them                                 as peers and working with them                                 in the most collaborative way possible                                 while also trying to break down and help                                 them navigate                                 a world that is not necessarily                                 kind and not necessarily as good                                 to all the people in in our world                                 as it should be so                                 where there are power differentials men                                 women                                 black white big company startup                                 leader in the project or                                 contributor to the project make sure                                 make absolute sure that you do not                                 presume what is going on in their head                                 but that you ask and engage with them                                 and you                                 try to remove as much as possible that                                 power dynamic                                 because that power dynamic will have its                                 own                                 place at the table in that conversation                                 so other things you should know clear                                 ownership is empowering everybody loves                                 this                                 if you have a whole group of people that                                 are given an action item                                 is it going to get done this point in a                                 regular keynote we'd all go no okay                                 so realize that if you feel                                 disenfranchised                                 or you see commune community members who                                  are super grumpy                                  or if you know that there's work that                                  could get done if the rules were                                  different                                  then there's actually a lot of                                  governance work that probably should be                                  done                                  but at that point it's not write the                                  constitution                                  it's develop the minimum viable                                  governance                                  it's this simple                                  write down what you're doing now                                  know that you won't get it right the                                  first time                                  absolutely know that and parenthetically                                  write in your first bit of governance                                  the model to change the governance and                                  update it because otherwise                                  bad things happen and then collaborate                                  empathize                                  and iterate on your governance                                  inside the project or inside                                  a company that's participating in a                                  project you can create a ton of mistrust                                  just by being misaligned because you                                  don't have                                  you don't have a consistent picture that                                  you're presenting                                  you've got some people who think things                                  are going swell and some things                                  that aren't and you need to be able to                                  notice that work with it understand it                                  project cadence is a contract so as you                                  are getting ready for your releases                                  do your best to stay with your                                  time schedules because                                  anything that is downstream from you                                  that is say a corporate sponsor's next                                  update                                  is also dependent on your release                                  never forget to take the opportunity                                  to do a retrospective to look back on                                  that release                                  to find out if in fact your                                  processes were followed if they were                                  onerous to make sure that there                                  is an update and if for some chance you                                  missed a date and there were                                  downstream uh impacts for a company                                  how was that handled by the uh by the                                  project by the companies etc                                  all of this is part of the contract                                  you have in a community trying to                                  provide                                  a project and                                  in the case of kubernetes it grew beyond                                  anything                                  we imagined and when i talk about                                  downstream contracts                                  there are                                                           kubernetes                                  and those are all all contracts we slip                                  a release date by a week                                  and a whole lot of companies have some                                  challenges                                  so to just child to just go                                  out and say straight back to the old                                  school                                  open source ethos we reject kings                                  presidents and voting we believe in                                  rough consensus and running code                                  so i challenge you all                                  to go out into your communities                                  make sure that the culture that you have                                  is the culture you want if it's not work                                  to change it                                  and take as many of these possible                                  learnings                                  because they are possible they may not                                  fit in every community take as many of                                  these learnings as is useful                                  to you and expand upon them learn more                                  come back and tell me i was wrong come                                  back and tell me i should add three more                                  points                                  write the following talk all of those                                  would be great options                                  so let's go back to the whole how did we                                  get here                                  talk through some of the things that                                  have led to our projects                                  looking the way they do the shapes that                                  they do where are we going                                  i didn't really touch on that yet right                                  so i'm leaving that as an exercise to                                  the reader                                  where are we going where do you want                                  your project communities to go                                  how do you want them to engage with                                  their ecosystem                                  how do you want them to engage with                                  corporate sponsors                                  what is the best of the open source                                  project                                  what is the purpose that a company                                  had in open sourcing a project think                                  about all of these things                                  and then let me know how i can help you                                  get where you want to go                                  thank you                                  uh thanks sarah                                  very good interesting talk um                                  there are a couple of questions                                  fantastic                                  um maybe there will be more um                                  but the first one is um and actually                                  there are some emoji reactions coming up                                  on the screen um uh                                  yeah the first question is from your                                  experience what's the best way to                                  make and keep a community open uh make                                  it easy for new people to become part of                                  it                                  i guess a often asked question yeah                                  what's                                  important what's my input on                                  um basically building it keeping it                                  together and                                  uh and then also making space for people                                  to grow                                  so that is that is for me one of the                                  pieces of this that is most important                                  is that we need to make sure that                                  there's space in a community for people                                  to grow                                  because people don't want to show up in                                  open source especially if they're not                                  being paid to contribute as their day                                  job                                  they don't necessarily want to show up                                  in open source and do their day job                                  again so they may want to be learning                                  and engaging on a new topic or                                  participating in some special interest                                  group so they can learn about it while                                  leading another                                  um so in terms of bringing together a                                  community                                  i'm always out looking for                                  the people who are um                                  who are raising their hands to do things                                  or                                  and the people who are complaining so in                                  a community                                  you can find the people who are like oh                                  i'll do that but you don't want to rely                                  on them too much because you will burn                                  them out really fast because they're                                  they're the people who jump up and say                                  i'll do that you also want to                                  acknowledge them and then you also want                                  to                                  um draw in the people say who are very                                  um                                  grumpy about something great let's                                  empower you to fix it                                  and so if you keep this actual                                  management going on                                  learning what your contributors want for                                  their career goals learning what your                                  contributors want to be                                  learning from the project as well as                                  what they're contributing to the project                                  offering them ways to get something back                                  that is a benefit to them as well as all                                  the work that they offer to the project                                  that to me makes for                                  a stickier community because there's a                                  second order effect of that so if you're                                  working to try to do all of that                                  with your community the second order                                  effect is you're making friends                                  and that keeps the community together                                  um yeah sure that that's the case                                  um second question is um                                  you talked about defining values for                                  your community                                  um when's the right time to agree on                                  those because                                  when you start a new project there isn't                                  the culture that then creates the value                                  so what comes first what comes second                                  i think early on it is i think you won't                                  be documenting your values                                  from like day one we're starting a new                                  project how about that                                  um you won't start from there                                  you will be having a lot of                                  conversations as you're setting up                                  this project with you know the peer                                  group that you have                                  the collaborators and contributors that                                  you're trying to do this it might be                                  four or five people                                  it might be two companies it might be                                  you know whatever it is                                  and as you are starting to make those                                  early decisions                                  you can actually look at how you're                                  making decisions there                                  and bring up these questions                                  you know the um for example the                                  community                                  versus community is better than company                                  or community comes before company in um                                  kubernetes values                                  that came because we had you know all                                  these different pull requests                                  that we were looking at and we're like                                  how do we make decisions on these you                                  know                                  is so red hat's a big contributor maybe                                  it means that red hat gets priority                                  well maybe not that doesn't seem right                                  either you know so as we were discussing                                  these things as leaders of the project                                  about how to make these decisions early                                  on                                  that led to those sort of nascent values                                  so we started talking through                                  what how we were making the decisions                                  and                                  that that was the first step toward                                  governance as well for us                                  was just like okay so we've made these                                  decisions we've been running this                                  project                                  like two and at the time we started                                  having these discussions the project had                                  been running like two years                                  and it was this sort of hazy um                                  you know which googler do you ask to get                                  permission to do this thing                                  and what if one of them disagrees but                                  one of them agrees what happens then                                  so we ended up having to um very slowly                                  tease out                                  how decisions were being made by looking                                  at what was happening organically                                  and then try to develop it as something                                  that we could write down
