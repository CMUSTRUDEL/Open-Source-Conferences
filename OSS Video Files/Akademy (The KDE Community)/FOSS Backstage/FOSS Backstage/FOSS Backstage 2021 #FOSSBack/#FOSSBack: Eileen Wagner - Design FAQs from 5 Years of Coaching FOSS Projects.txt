	                              thank you paul                               thank you so much for having me um i                               really i should say i always really                               enjoyed                               coming to fuss backstage and having                               these sort of more                               i should say meta conversations around                               open source                               and i really hope that this is one of                                those talks as well                                where you know on the one hand you know                                i'm trying to give you some kind of                                quick tips                                um just based on all the design work                                that i've been doing in open source                                but also maybe in highlighting these you                                know different                                aspects and maybe blind spots that we've                                been facing uh this is also a way to                                enter some of those more                                um well looking at the systematic                                questions right                                asking about the structures and the                                overarching issues uh                                so this is sort of the the goal for my                                session today                                um but yeah let's start at the beginning                                who am i                                uh my name is eileen i am a designer in                                open source uh this is how i feel most                                of the time                                when i am an open source um previously                                uh before i you know called myself a                                designer i was                                a open source and public interest tech                                advocate                                um in berlin and previously previously                                you know my background is actually                                in mathematical logic and philosophy so                                in case you ever wonder where those                                philosophers end up this is where they                                end up they design                                in open source um i work for an                                organization called simply secure                                we're a us-based nonprofit and most of                                the time we do design research and this                                sort of                                coaching when there is not a pandemic                                going on we host events and gatherings                                and of course in in doing that we try to                                write a lot and                                develop toolkits design pattern                                libraries videos                                to help support the community so this                                sort of thing where we open source our                                methodologies                                is very much in line with what we do we                                work with mostly infrastructure funders                                across the globe um and as                                paul has already said we we coached a                                lot of projects uh in the subtitle it                                says uh over a hundred projects simply                                secure has definitely worked with                                over a hundred projects i think these                                are just some of them uh                                i i myself i counted that recently i the                                number is probably more around                                                                                                       have been directly working with                                so all this is to say like we have been                                doing this for a few years now and we've                                you know                                come to coachings uh where basically uh                                we just sort of like hey do you need a                                designer what can we do for you and then                                projects come to us for help and in                                doing so you know there are obviously                                some larger patterns we see and so today                                really like what i'm trying to think                                about is what are the                                frequently asked questions in those                                coachings and can we                                talk about them in a more systematic way                                that might benefit                                the whole space so here i am i                                uh i crystallized eight because we only                                have half an hour today and i want to be                                really mindful of everybody's time                                so i'm gonna just go through these eight                                uh there are definitely more but you                                know i'll stick around you can ask me                                more there's also a whole ux clinic                                going on so                                um you know if you have more questions                                you can always uh                                yeah dive in so without further ado                                let me let me just start let me start                                with like what is the most common design                                question that we get um oh without                                 further ado                                 should disclaimer these are quick tips                                 to get you started they're                                 um not a replacement for ux process like                                 i'm not saying                                 do this instead of actually going                                 through the process of ux design                                 um but yeah this is a place to start                                 and of course these slides will be made                                 available either directly at the fox                                 backstage venue list place or                                 uh i'll tweet them out or something like                                 that                                 okay without further ado now um                                 by far the most frequent question is                                 this logo                                 okay i made a logo what do you think is                                 this okay                                 what do i need to change um and                                 my answer to that is always like yes yes                                 it is it's okay                                 design is you know really about making                                 the tool make sense to people so                                 you know if you want to have a nice                                 visual design yes that is part of that                                 but often not the most important part                                 often the most important part                                 is making something make sense to people                                 so um you know whenever you do have a                                 logo                                 and a color palette and a name that you                                 want feedback on                                 that's important but it's probably not                                 the most important thing                                 having said that though there are some                                 great resources you can help yourselves                                 like there's                                 there's the noun project you know there                                 are color palettes that you can choose                                 from like there are people where                                 designers and communities you know work                                 together and have actually done some                                 stuff                                 for the community that it's open to use                                 um                                 logo desk is a great place for unused                                 logos you can go to unsplash for images                                 never forget to check for accessibility                                 when you're thinking about color and                                 stuff like that                                 um there's a lot of resources and                                 there's even uh you know collections of                                 tools                                 um i listed some of those uh the last                                 one here is a guide                                 for it's literally called design for uh                                 non-designers and i think it made the                                 rounds on hacker news                                 basically there are resources out there                                 use them rely on them                                 they're good you can you don't have to                                 spend a lot of time thinking about it                                 the more important part about thinking                                 about logo and colors is probably                                 you want some sense of consistency you                                 want to have a style                                 guide so as you are developing                                 those styles make sure it's documented                                 and communicated to your team and the                                 wider community so that                                 you know it actually leads to something                                 being used and recognized in                                 a wider way so that's that's kind of                                 what i have to say about logos and                                 colors                                 um second most frequent ask question                                 most frequently asked question is                                 how do i improve usability like let's                                 let's do it let's i want to do i want to                                 talk about usability how do i even start                                 um and for that like my question is just                                 it depends                                 usability is not something you know it's                                 not a binary property it's not like                                 you're there is a scale and you can rank                                 you know between like                                                    like it's it's always something that is                                 very contextual                                 right like i have here on the right you                                 know uh nasa is like you know                                 landing like rocket landing technology                                 is not going to be like one big button                                 that just says                                 land rocket right it's going to be very                                 involved depending on what the use cases                                 are                                 so who are your users in what context do                                 they use your tool                                 you need to define and scope exactly                                 kind of                                 how you fit in and based on that then                                 you can                                 start thinking about usability um so the                                 first tool i would like to offer up is                                 just a simple value proposition tool                                 um you can use it like this a project                                 name right some project                                 is a mobile platform for people in a                                 neighborhood to                                 share their tools and expertise very                                 simple formula you can apply                                 in many contexts another example this                                 project                                 is a secure protocol for sysadmins in                                 human rights orgs to                                 configure remote devices again                                 super it gives me a very good overview                                 of                                 what what is it you know is it an animal                                 a mineral a vegetable what is it                                 and who it is who is who is it for                                 and what context are they using it based                                 on that then                                 again i'm giving out tools today um                                 create personas create personas of the                                 people that you're working for and                                 really understand                                 get a deeper understanding of their                                 their needs and challenges                                 and do just some lightweight journey                                 mapping no need to do like a full                                 service design blueprint                                 but just sort of like what are the steps                                 they                                 take on this journey in interacting with                                 your tool                                 um and how can you yeah what are the                                 pain points that you can identify and                                 how can you                                 sort of like uh fill in the gaps and the                                 needs along the way                                 um again lightweight things                                 to think about here's another one how do                                 i get that user feedback right we talked                                 about you know okay                                 understanding who the users are but how                                 do i actually get feedback to implement                                 um in our in our development process                                 and i think my answer there is also                                 depends on                                 where you put it and how you place it i                                 have this                                 image here of you know i don't know if                                 you've seen those before you know you go                                 to a restroom and then you're asked                                 like to rate it afterwards and i don't                                 think those get really good responses                                 because nobody wants to touch                                 buttons that other people might have                                 touched after they went to the bathroom                                 right so                                 what where do you place that like                                 feedback giving                                 moment in the process and i think there                                 are two                                 main ways of approaching this one way is                                 to think about                                 passively getting user feedback and this                                 is just looking at your github issues                                 and seeing which ones                                 are about ux or ui identifying them and                                 kind of getting a feel for what people                                 are running into um                                 talk to your technical support team if                                 you have one they usually have the best                                 idea of like what's working and what's                                 not working um you can also offer a                                 feedback form                                 always you can always just put it on                                 your website                                 and wait for things to come in of course                                 that has the major downside that                                 this is going to be uh there's going to                                 be a huge selection bias                                 right like people who can come and                                 actually file something with you                                 are probably good hub users already so                                 you have a massive                                 selection bias the other way to do it is                                 to actively seek out user feedback so                                 talking to people talking to real people                                 um three to six                                 great number don't need to go further                                 than that                                 and what you should probably go further                                 then is your community right                                 just think about like what would it take                                 to grab someone                                 maybe not someone off the street but                                 like grab someone who                                 is interested in these topics but has                                 never seen your tool before like                                 talk to someone like that and just you                                 know put something in front of them and                                 see what they think right like that's                                 that's also a great place to get some                                 feedback um when you do                                 have a github issue tracking flow                                 add a ux bug template in it right and                                 and the the template should just be                                 you know what what are you running into                                 and what are your expectations like kind                                 of like any good                                 bug reporting but just make sure that                                 you give people in a special place                                 to file and to also track ux bugs                                 um and finally also a good way um if                                 you're not                                 you know tracking any people which                                 nobody should be doing anyway but like                                 you know if you want to know like oh who                                 are actually my users send out a survey                                 right um                                 send out a survey and see who responds                                 and uh get some like basic                                 demographic information about your user                                 base that sometimes also goes a long way                                 and now okay well all right eileen you                                 told me about how to actually                                 you know talk to real people well but                                 how do i test my piece of software right                                 like there's one there's a difference                                 between                                 talking to people and testing software                                 testing software doesn't have to be                                 complicated testing software can be                                 anything like                                 i'm printing out my website                                 and i'm having people highlight things                                 that confuse them like in this case uh                                 with a project we worked with um least                                 authorities gridsync                                 um it was just yeah mark anything that                                 is really really confusing to you                                 and i love this particular example                                 because you know we think                                 oh open source transparency unlike other                                 client-side encryption services                                 this is free open-source software anyone                                 can read the code                                 and confirm that it doesn't have secret                                 backdoors and this user tester is just                                 literally                                 circled at anyone and said well i can't                                 like not any anyone can read the i can't                                 read the code                                 doesn't mean anything to me who cares                                 right and that                                 those are the sort of moments you really                                 want to capture in a user testing                                 situation                                 and to that end also giving you some                                 guidance this is a video that we shot um                                 just basically                                 have a way to interact with someone                                 where you can be open-minded                                 and resist the urge to educate right                                 because in this sort of user testing                                 scenario you really have to like                                 flip the dynamic and you have to be the                                 learner                                 rather than the teacher and you have to                                 learn from someone to really teach you                                 about                                 how your tool works or doesn't work for                                 their context                                 paper prototypes super helpful you know                                 you don't even write a line of code to                                 to test anything you can just literally                                 draw it                                 you know make sure the screens kind of                                 make sense um i really love using sort                                 of like                                 sticky notes are great like in this size                                 that's a perfect mobile screen                                 um just grab something and start drawing                                 um if you want more guidance again                                 here's a small video                                 and there's also uh our partners okay                                 thanks have a guide of like you know                                 just                                 give someone a guide give someone a tour                                 of your tool                                 and see what they how they deal with it                                 or not                                 all right how to organize settings                                 super super frequent question because of                                 course we love                                 having lots of different ways to                                 interact with                                 a tool and having lots of options to                                 customize                                 my first answer is defaults                                 think about how you

    options to to customize                                 um of course you know when i think about                                 that i always think about                                 this particular video that i shot uh                                 in a taiwanese bathroom you have the                                 you know all the intricacies all the                                 options of customizability                                 in the background but what you're doing                                 is you're putting a mask                                 in front of it to make it simple to most                                 people's needs                                 right so think about that metaphor of                                 like what it would mean in your                                 particular tool to just give people some                                 help and some guidance um                                 yeah help                                 writing i need to write how do i write                                 can someone help me write like this is                                 uh                                 often a real like panic moment to a lot                                 of projects                                 um like now i actually have to write a                                 documentation where do i start                                 um my kind of almost simplistic answer                                 there is you know start with like the                                 really really                                 like the first places one level at a                                 time                                 start with what is this thing like                                 again is it an animal a mineral or a                                 vegetable like what is it                                 how does it work how do i use it as a                                 person and why should i use it those are                                 the four questions you really need to                                 answer                                 to anybody any reader coming to your                                 website coming to your tool starter page                                 basically                                 those are the four questions you really                                 want to answer and i also want to say                                 the hardest part about writing is really                                 communicating the relevant information                                 at the right time                                 and it's something that lots of people                                 don't                                 don't appreciate you know that basically                                 you know those                                 four types of information can also be                                 very very different depending on who                                 your reader is                                 so i just i just started this because i                                 feel like                                 that's a lot of people have that in                                 common like you have like your                                 contributor audience you have your user                                 audience and then you have the                                 quote-unquote rest of the world audience                                 those four questions are going to be                                 very very different both in                                 the format and in the tone depending on                                 where you know who your reader is and                                 where they're reading it                                 so um just to give you some examples                                 like what is this you know for the rest                                 of the world should probably be on the                                 level of like explain it like i'm five                                 right like don't                                 don't give me um more information that i                                 need                                 uh versus you know a how does it work                                 question for your contributor                                 probably is more you know suitable as a                                 spec or a white paper                                 um really think hard about like how                                 people                                 are going to try to understand your tool                                 and like divide up the bits of writing                                 in these parts um writing is hard                                 anybody who says writing is easy is                                 probably                                 not necessarily a good writer right                                 writing really takes laboring over so                                 it's okay that it's hard but just make                                 sure that you go one step at a time                                 um faqs are really                                 great to help people troubleshoot if you                                 want people to like look up something                                 and you know honestly if you're                                 definitely getting faqs                                 um put them in there if you're not                                 getting faqs                                 um don't use that as kind of a crutch to                                 actually                                 write stuff right like they're not a                                 replacement for good writing                                 um like i i know i just showed you like                                 you know these questions but                                 um these questions should be a guidance                                 to your writing they should not actually                                 be                                 appear on the website because it it's                                 like um                                 it's too many questions and people are                                 finding it hard to navigate                                 also just you know like                                 public service announcement like if you                                 ever find yourself saying like go and                                 read the manual                                 it's probably time to rethink your                                 information architecture right it's                                 probably                                 a really really good indicator that                                 people cannot find                                 the information in a timely and relevant                                 place                                 so um again go back to that like menu                                 bar and like                                 just literally write things on like                                 index cards                                 and try to like sort them in a way                                 according to context according to                                 audience and see if you can make sense                                 of it in a better way                                 um i want to say a really great way of                                 writing                                 is using metaphors um this is an example                                 from                                 tails that i brought uh tails is a live                                 operating system that you can                                 you know put on a usb stick it has this                                 really wonderful feature of being                                 amnesic which means                                 whenever you you know unplug it                                 everything gets deleted                                 so to say like there's nothing on it                                 that can trace back to you                                 and tails really found a wonderful way                                 of describing something that is kind of                                 technically a little bit more complex                                 in a very accessible way by using this                                 metaphor of a tent                                 right it's a tent that you roll up                                 whenever you leave you know                                 the contents get are gone you can do                                 lots of things in the tent but like                                 once you roll up the tent that you know                                 nothing should be inside                                 um and this this sort of idea you know                                 using metaphors to really explain a                                 technology to                                 first-time users that that is sort of                                 the holy grail of a writer                                 um and in this case also a really good                                 thing to illustrate                                 okay ui                                 user interface where to start like there                                 is lots of stuff out there today lots of                                 like                                 design tools um how do i you know how do                                 i first                                 you know implement anything to begin                                 with i would say                                 start where you are don't don't                                 overthink it                                 use familiar ui patterns wherever you                                 can                                 your users thank you very much um and                                 the other thing i want to just like                                 sneakily say there's no copyrighted                                 design patterns                                 right like anything that you see that is                                 a nice pattern                                 in the wild you can use basically                                 um and what is a design pattern it's a                                 sort of like well we'll get there in a                                 second but like i want to just show you                                 the real quick                                 um wonderful methodology here which is                                 oh this this website has a really good                                 layout that i like too                                 maybe we should use that and then you                                 just literally like                                 print it out again and trace it and then                                 next thing you do you have you have the                                 actual wireframe already                                 right like you can just just do that um                                 design pattern this is from a coaching                                 with fab access they're doing                                 sort of like open source user                                 management of fab labs and makerspaces                                 and because they're federated they have                                 this wonderful feature that when you go                                 into a space                                 you can use the same app to sign on to                                 different servers right you can say oh                                 this is this particular                                 makerspace so i'm going to sign on as                                 you know this user and this server                                 versus you know some other makerspace as                                 that other user                                 in that server um they just they just                                 used a very basic wi-fi                                 design pattern i don't know if you can                                 see that but basically you know you have                                 this sort of like                                 active connection and then there are the                                 other connections that are also                                 available that you can also choose from                                 and this sort of idea that well you know                                 connecting to a server technically has                                 well not                                 it doesn't have a lot of overlap with                                 wi-fi but the mental model                                 is super similar and whenever you can                                 find opportunities like that                                 rely on something that you can use                                 uh you know over and over again um                                 because your users will be familiar with                                 that pattern already                                 that's just a tip from the ui side of                                 things                                 okay and finally sorry for the                                 the tongue and cheekness of this but um                                 how do we hire designers                                 what's the best way to hire designers                                 and this is a                                 this is a joke um uh that i should                                 you know credit my fellow simply secure                                 folks for um                                 how many black turtlenecks do we have to                                 give away to get designers to work on                                 this open source project                                 and i think it's a really really hard                                 question                                 and it touches on some of the structural                                 things that we've been talking about                                 um you know these past two three days                                 i would say start by asking start by                                 asking                                 in the best case scenario you have a                                 designer as a user already                                 and they might be interested to                                 contribute in some fashion                                 um there are lots of designers also who                                 are                                 working in your domain you know maybe                                 your domain is                                 you know fab labs maybe your domain is                                 uh in browser security like they're                                 they're designers who are working in                                 those domains                                 and you just need to kind of actively                                 seek them out a little bit                                 um or you know the hard part is to                                 actually put in time                                 to onboard designers to your project um                                 that takes a lot of time both from                                 you as a project but also from designers                                 so it's like um                                 sort of a you know an investment on both                                 ends but i do want to point to this                                 really wonderful thing that happened                                 last year at least in my little world it                                 was kind of amazing                                 musescore is a wonderful open source                                 tool for                                 jotting down music any you know if                                 you're composing if you're arranging if                                 you're                                 whatever it is if you kind of work with                                 sheet music you probably have bumped                                 into muse core at some point um and                                 there's this wonderful                                 uh youtuber who's you know a ux designer                                 uh who loves to compose and uh his name                                 is martin curie and he                                 did this like                                                       musescore on all the things that you                                 know he he saw that were                                 problematic that were like torturous and                                 horrible for a designer on musescore                                 and um the way musescore responded and                                 the                                 you know ensuing conversations that                                 would have happened                                 actually have led to martin being the                                 head of design at musescore                                 months later right so this sort of like                                 small                                 interactions you know that's exactly the                                 sort of thing that                                 um we can like hope to see more of                                 by by having more designers using open                                 source tools                                 who can then like actually take on some                                 more responsibilities                                 um again not this is not hopefully not                                 an exception                                 the other good route to go is to think                                 about how                                 you want to have design contributions                                 rather than just code contributions for                                 your project                                 this is from elementary os which is a                                 kind of like a                                 mac like linux distribution that you can                                 use                                 and they don't just have you know how to                                 support us                                 as a web developer um as a desktop uh                                 developer                                 they also have design like if you're a                                 designer                                 this is how you can be part of the                                 conversation and so that's something i                                 think                                 more people can more projects more                                 people can think about                                 uh introducing like basically what are                                 the like                                 things that designers can contribute to                                 how do you make it easy                                 in terms of onboarding them and                                 including them as part of the community                                 i should also say working in open source                                 with all of its you know ups and downs                                 it also means having huge amount of                                 variety and working on hard problems and                                 having lots of impact right so                                 designers actually once they come in                                 here                                 they're really motivated to work more on                                 it like i listed some of the                                 topics that i worked on just in the last                                 two years                                 and i don't know if i should read it but                                 like basically you know like                                 how to design a privacy-minded                                 period tracker how to teach people about                                 in-browser malware                                 how to reliably document human rights                                 violations these are all like                                 different questions that you can touch                                 on just by like                                 joining an open source project and i                                 feel like these are the kind of things                                 that we can                                 uh you know advocate for more also in                                 the design circles                                 um that this is really you know once you                                 once you kind of                                 get over the first initial hurdle of                                 joining an open source project                                 that there is actually a lot of fun um                                 and joy                                 to the work that that we all do                                 um finally i would you know be a miss if                                 i don't point you to                                 uh open source design the community of                                 designers who have been here for years                                 and have been saying the same things for                                 years                                 uh they have a job board uh you can find                                 it um                                 at you know                                 opensource.opensourcedesign.net                                 jobs um where you can post you know                                 specific                                 asks that you might have and this is                                 also a place where designers can come                                 in and maybe pick a thing up or too                                 um so that leaves me with you know                                 major things to to to take home uh talk                                 to your users                                 and your potential users you know                                 understand the needs and pains                                 uh not just of those who are currently                                 using your tool but hopefully who might                                 be using your tool in the future                                 always focus on onboarding explanations                                 and documentation                                 rather than just like the pretty the                                 logos                                 and really help guide your users with                                 good writing from their ui's                                 easy way finding just sort of put                                 yourself in their shoes and see what                                 what would happen                                 and the most important thing maybe ux                                 and ui design is a mindset i think                                 rather than a craft                                 just thinking about usability and                                 accessibility                                 is is sort of a perspective it's a lens                                 on things um                                 applying that perspective is way more                                 important                                 than yeah making

           questions that i can include in the                                 future versions of faqs from design                                 coaching                                 that's it from me this is me um and yeah                                 i'm gonna stick around a little bit for                                 more questions if you have any questions                                 yeah so first of all thank you very much                                 for this a very interesting talk um i                                 learned a lot actually um                                 i will try to to put to work soon um but                                 we actually also we had a few questions                                 um                                 on our platform um                                 so i'll just start with those                                 um the first question is do you think                                 that users could report ux problems                                 better if uh fos operating systems like                                 linux provided better tools to                                 record and paste short videos and                                 screens                                 yeah i think that's i think that's a                                 good way to get user feedback if you                                 don't have any other                                 solutions but i've been saying that                                 literally talking to people will get you                                 better information and this is and i                                 really do believe that                                 qualitative information is is not to be                                 replaced                                 um yes you can have screen recordings                                 and you can get more data and you can                                 have it built in more i i don't think                                 that's a bad idea                                 but i really do think that there's no                                 way around actually just sitting down                                 with the person and testing it                                 okay and the other question is a bit                                 more uh specific                                 and one of the projects you talked about                                 um entails do they specifically                                 research how to make the default better                                 because if you start                                 from scratch every time um yeah usually                                 on linux systems you have to                                 like build up as a convenient um yeah                                 starting point for you                                 um yeah how do they approach that yeah i                                 should say                                 tails out of the many many sort of                                 security-minded open source projects is                                 one of the most user-focused                                 projects i think and teams they really                                 have usability in mind first and                                 foremost                                 so when they make decisions and you know                                 i'm not part of the tales team but                                 my understanding is they really think                                 hard about what the defaults are                                 what is the like minimum required things                                 that                                 people need in this particular operating                                 system and how can we make the defaults                                 saner than usual i work with them                                 especially around                                 explaining tales to new users and also                                 in the onboarding flow so you can kind                                 of see like                                 more guidance more explanation always                                 helps but yeah the other point about                                 sane defaults um i think also stands so                                 i hope this answers the question                                 you
