Title: #FOSSBack: Danese Cooper - The Evolution of OSPOs
Publication date: 2021-03-01
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	The concept of Open Source Program Offices or OSPOs is a familiar one within the corporate open source world. A growing number of governments, cities and universities have now also identified the benefits of OSPOs. However, public sector OSPOs tend to have a different set of priorities to Corporate OSPOs. While at Sun Microsystems, Danese Cooper set up one of the first OSPOs, just a few months after the term Open Source was coined. In this session, Danese will give an update on OSPO trends, explore how public sector OSPOs can differ from corporate OSPOs, and share how OSPOs can enable global collaboration to scale impact, and achieve public policy goals.

	                              hi                               there um this is a hastily done                               presentation because i only heard i was                               doing this recently                               but i'm happy to talk about this topic                               because                               ospos are near and dear to my heart                               you'll learn more about that in a minute                               it's a growing trend although those of                                us in the tech world have known about                                them for a long time                                and so let's begin if you have questions                                please put them in the chat                                and we will have a q a at the end so if                                i say anything that                                bothers you know let me know all right                                here we go                                so first of all here's a little timeline                                to get us started                                um you'll notice and this is not to                                scale                                time wise you know where the actual                                things land because                                the free software foundation was of                                course years ahead of the rest of us                                in recognizing the opportunity of uh                                what we now call open source                                back then it was called free software                                exclusively                                and there was reasons for that but in                                                                    the term open source was coined by some                                folks at a meeting that was convened by                                o'reilly                                and o'reilly publishing and o'reilly                                also published a book                                that was essays by the prominent players                                in the free software movement the reason                                they sought a change of name                                was of course because free is an                                ambiguous term                                in english it means both gratis and                                and free as in freedom and                                that fears and freedom is kind of what                                richard stallman meant but                                there was confusion and it was causing                                some problems in the business community                                which                                tim o'reilly noticed and others had                                noticed as well in                                                  was the first corporation to ever create                                an open source project                                um volitionally you know as a strategy                                and they of course had a group that got                                together to talk about                                building that license and the terms                                under which they would work                                and that could be considered um                                the first the first office                                around an open source thing in                                corporation                                however linux had been going for a while                                and there were several sort of linux                                clubs inside of                                the leading tech corporations and i know                                because i was in one at apple                                in the early                                                          after                                linux was founded and i know b del                                garvey was already um                                puttering around with it at hp but i                                i actually believe i started the first                                corporate                                ospo or the first ospo and the reason                                that we called it an                                ospo which stands for open source                                program office                                is because sun was really big on program                                offices there were program offices for                                everything                                and so since i was going to focus on                                open source i was hired in                                in early                                                          and we started talking about it that way                                and it's an obvious acronym i don't                                think it was particularly clever                                but it seems to have stuck because that                                is the term that is generally used now                                um sun needed an ospo because they were                                making a big bet in open source                                now going on through the timeline and by                                                                                deep tech companies already                                had an ospo and that's only a year later                                but you know                                hp ibm intel even microsoft                                it was not very functional hospital at                                that point but they had one                                uh novell and apple i know for sure had                                 there i may have missed a few and i'm                                 not trying to be exhaustive here but the                                 idea is there were a handful                                 and they were mostly you'll notice                                 companies that worked in                                 operating systems and particularly                                 around unix                                 so what came right after that was                                 a gradual expansion that by                                      seemed to us in the open source world                                 like a landslide                                                                                                        the working on um                                 the open source initiative and so i did                                 that                                 for                                                                    at out of it because i was too busy at                                 that point i was the cto of wikipedia                                 and that was taken up all my time                                 but also it looked to me like it was an                                 inevitability that open source was going                                 to prevail                                 we'd been through a few rounds of                                 arguing about whether the licensing                                 needed to change whether open source                                 definition needed to change                                 but the fact that money was starting to                                 accumulate behind                                 osbos was a pretty big deal right um                                 so then in                                                      in the marketplace um as in we stopped                                 having traditional enemies                                 and uh mostly we stopped having                                 microsoft as a traditional enemy that's                                 the year that satya nadella became                                 the ceo of microsoft that's also the                                 year that stephen vaughn nichols                                 uh wrote his famous paper that basically                                 said open source says one                                 get over it um and then                                 in                                                 and second wave of the rise of the ospo                                 and this i would argue is a new kind of                                 ospo it's a little bit different than                                 the corporate ospo                                 corporate osbos are very deeply                                 discussed in places like the to do group                                 at the linux foundation                                 but the ospo plus plus as a concept                                 is about the institutionality of the                                 existence of ospos                                 being helped or being used as a way to                                 help                                 municipalities and academia to join this                                 movement                                 more largely you know like mit has been                                 doing open courseware for a long time                                 but most large research institutions in                                 the world                                 are not that deeply involved um the                                 city of munich adopted open source and                                 kicked out microsoft back in                                                                                                       back and forth                                 as politics have you know prevailed                                 we're pro                                 we're pro microsoft we're not pro                                 microsoft we're pro microsoft again                                 um and we'll talk about that some more                                 but a broad                                 stroke like the european union in                                      um                                 revealing that they were going to                                 recommend uh that there be                                 ospos all throughout the european union                                 at a municipal level                                 and a city-state level and that the                                 the federation of those city-states                                 which is the eu                                 was also going to engage in osbo as a                                 way of                                 getting the citizenry and all of the                                 people involved to understand the                                 potential of open source for                                 municipalities all right so that's the                                 basic timeline                                 that i'm going to talk through now i                                 already said that we started the first                                 hospital sun                                 let me say a little bit more about why                                 that was important to us                                 at the dawn of open source there were                                 still a fair number of people                                 trying to define what that meant the                                 free software folks wanted a complete                                 graph                                 of what they had to say including the                                 political manifesto that came with that                                 back in that era but there were other                                 people who thought that they could do a                                 better job                                 one of them was bill joy who was the                                 chief scientist of sun                                 and of course founded the bsd project                                 while he was a grad student at cal                                 and therefore wrote the bsd license                                 right so he had credit credentials                                 um he believed that the                                 that open source as originally conceived                                 was not going to work very well                                 in corporate settings there had been a                                 commitment made not by bill joy to open                                 source java                                 in thinking through how he could do that                                 or how that could be done in a way that                                 wouldn't                                 seed control because corporations were                                 all about control back then                                 they came up with a blade and spoke                                 model license called                                 the scuzzle or sun community source                                 license                                 it was not an open source license it did                                 not pass the osd                                 they tried to make a hail mary play to                                 say look we love you little open source                                 initiative but                                 we have longer experience and we think                                 it should happen this other way and that                                 was unsuccessful                                 thankfully i was actually hired to                                 defend this guzzle                                 and i only did it for six months before                                 i                                 was convinced by the community that this                                 was the wrong way to go about it                                 and i became a true believer and this is                                 something that happens over and over                                 again                                 in corporations where people become ospo                                 spokespeople they they um often                                 drink the kool-aid and whatever the                                 corporate agenda is over the history of                                 aspas whatever the corporate agenda is                                 it starts to morph                                 in the person of that person so that                                 happened to me                                 and um i actually quit son it's because                                 i was tired of being told that                                 we weren't doing things right and i                                 couldn't seem to influence them to                                 change it                                 but at the time they were interested in                                 keeping me at sun                                 more than they were interested in being                                 right about that and so                                 they offered me an opportunity to open                                 an                                 espo and open source program office in                                 order to                                 create a more authentic open source at                                 sun and                                 help educate people and hopefully change                                 minds of people                                 leaders like bill joy so that's why we                                 did it                                 um so now we're going to talk about the                                 age of the paleolithic ospo                                 these are the big moves in prehistory uh                                 and this is a piece of paleolithic art                                 of uh                                 cave face in uh france                                 famously so this is the beginning of                                 prehistory first time humans                                 do something that we can date um ospo's                                 at this time were mostly about                                 legal encumbrant and um                                 attention to detail that for-profit                                 software and not get                                 sucked into what was seen as a                                 problematic licensing model                                 in the copyleft licenses now for the                                 record                                 i don't think that copyleft is                                 problematic i think that there are some                                 really good reasons to use                                 copyleft i i am a member of the apache                                 software foundation as well and i                                 also have a deep belief in the right                                 times and reasons to use permissive                                 licensing                                 in the paleolithic period most of the                                 ospas were run by lawyers                                 including the sun osbo although i was                                 running it                                 i had an assigned lawyer whose job was                                 to keep me on the straight and narrow                                 and we did exhaustive readings of the                                 license text                                 and tried to understand it through the                                 lens of corporate                                 licensing and corporate contract law and                                 we grouped them into ones we were                                 willing to deal with the ones we weren't                                 willing to deal with one of those was                                 the gpl                                 there was a blanket statement made that                                 sun would never touch gpl                                 licensing and then only a year later we                                 licensed the                                 um open office project under the lgpl so                                 we were blowing through our own edicts                                 pretty quickly this was really really                                 common there was a lot of vanity                                 licensing happening where                                 companies were putting their names on                                 licenses and then                                 throwing code over the wall apple did a                                 famous one of these when they switched                                 to the mock kernel                                 they um they created the darwin project                                 they hired some of the best engineers in                                 the bsd community                                 to run it and then they proceeded to                                 undermine that community by                                 tossing tar balls of each successive                                 build of the actual operating system                                 over the wall and and you know blowing                                 up whatever the community was doing over                                 and over again until everybody left that                                 took about a year so in the paleolithic                                 time most                                 ospos were pretty broken                                 then came the mesolithic period of aspas                                 and this was a transition period this                                 this coincides with                                 the large growth that                                                   growth for ospos that i                                 between                                                              know slid into the mesolithic                                 it became pretty clear that a vanity                                 license was a bad idea                                 because it didn't create interoperable                                 code it didn't promote code reuse                                 even some of the best you know                                 intentions like the mozilla project's                                 original license                                 instead of creating an olympic size pool                                 of code that could be reused                                 it basically created infinite                                 kiddie pools of code and that's because                                 of the way the license was written                                 it wasn't interoperable between versions                                 and so                                 the apple public license which was an                                 exact copy of the mozilla public license                                 made a separate pool of code i hope you                                 can understand what i'm saying there                                 there was some progress made some                                 notable progress made                                 starting with i think the open office                                 project at sun                                 we started to show that open source                                 could                                 both satisfy a corporate greed                                 while also satisfying a human need                                 so the open source project known as                                 openoffice was built                                 to hurt microsoft full stop                                 that is what sun cared about that's why                                 they spent the money                                 people like me that were helping                                 conceive of this project and pushing it                                 forward and designing it                                 we're looking for also a rise of the                                 boats around people being able to use                                 productivity                                 software without learning a new language                                 because microsoft is only supporting                                    languages worldwide                                 part of our strategy was to make sure                                 that people could localize open office                                 into their own                                 needed language and we had at one point                                                                                                        wikipedia similarly you know is about                                 giving you the some of the world                                 knowledge in your own language and                                 um the truth is that sun didn't care                                 about that in your own language thing                                 except to the extent that it was pushing                                 their agenda                                 of scaring the pants off of microsoft by                                 you know getting substantial market                                 share away from them in a short period                                 of time                                 at                                                            openoffice were downloaded every time we                                 turned to version so we're pretty                                 successful at that                                 another really fine example of an ospo                                 that was serving a corporation but doing                                 it creatively                                 was a google summer code where summer                                 code                                 both helped google in a material way but                                 google was not                                 giving away the secrets of their search                                 engine even though they were using gpl                                 license code                                 they were using the loophole that they                                 weren't distributing that code they were                                 just performing it on their website                                 so they weren't legally required to give                                 those changes                                 back but they were sort of aware that                                 they had a moral obligation                                 and they got interested in ways to make                                 the open source community better                                 directly through the efforts of their                                 ospo                                 and thinking about how to grow the                                 pool of open source developers that were                                 available they thought wow there's all                                 those students that                                 in cs departments what if we made a cash                                 prize for them to come and be involved                                 in open source                                 over their summer and they um                                 you know we would pay them we would make                                 some minimum requirements of what                                 you know positive involvement looks like                                 oh and by the way since we're fast                                 tracking them we probably need the                                 projects to agree so that it's not a big                                 you know for them so let's                                 include the projects in the planning get                                 them to agree to mentor a certain number                                 of students place the students with the                                 projects and then you know do some                                 analysis of how well they do                                 this also allowed in addition to helping                                 them with their open source reputation                                 it allowed them to preview some of the                                 best                                 up and coming open source ready                                 engineers                                 that were about to graduate from school                                 so it was also a recruiting thing for                                 them                                 so you know this is basically a way to                                 say to you                                 and ospo doesn't only have to protect                                 the corporation                                 but you also heard me say in the                                 mesolithic period                                 there was a fundamental shift in the                                 architecture of software towards                                 software as a service                                 so in the paleolithic period we were                                 still shipping                                 shrink wrapping cds dvds                                 flappy disks of software and people were                                 going to fry's                                 and buying it off of a shelf and taking                                 it home and putting it in their computer                                 but by the mesolithic period i think                                 there started to be easier ways to get                                 software distributed                                 and some of them were not distributed at                                 all                                 like the linux use that google did they                                 were performant                                 and because the licenses were not                                 written to                                 touch that performant issue with the                                 exception at this point of the affairo                                 gpl                                 or agpl that all the other licenses                                 didn't                                 close that gap and so even the gp                                 even the copy left licenses were                                 fundamentally permissive as long as you                                 were just                                 performing so if you were shipping it in                                 a car in a vehicle that you were                                 building like a lot of the                                 automakers did then you were in                                 violation of the gpl and                                 the free software foundation continues                                 to track down people who violate the gpl                                 and try to get them to understand                                 what that distribution trigger looks                                 like                                 but they've been slow to close that                                 that permissive um i'm sorry that                                 performance loop                                 and that allowed a lot of new companies                                 to set up ospos                                 make sure they stayed on the right side                                 of that loop but also                                 realize that they still had to give back                                 in some material way to stay on the                                 right side                                 morally of the open source community                                 okay                                 the third big wave of ospos is the                                 neolithic gospel                                 that is the sort of almost uh recorded                                 history                                 ospo and um this by the way is off of                                 newgrange and                                 ireland and the country i live in now                                 and uh i would say                                 that that the difference between                                 mesolithic and neolithic is                                 that now open source has won and we're                                 starting to see                                 companies like microsoft revisit the                                 activities of their ospo                                 i suppose are starting to show up                                 everywhere in the industry at this point                                 and um even outside of the industry                                 starting to see some ospos so early                                 early adoption i suppose both in                                 academia and in cities happened much                                 earlier                                 but we're starting to see them become                                 more effective as we get into the                                 neolithic period                                 we're seeing um because open source has                                 one there's an                                 there's a re-examination uh by the                                 by a new crop of businesses that want to                                 take advantage of the halo effect of                                 open source                                 without actually dealing with all of the                                 requirements and osbos are                                 key to help educate people about                                 you know why that's wrong thinking what                                 direction to go                                 it also provides a single point of                                 contact to a burgeoning                                 open source developer pool for a company                                 that's trying to stay on top of things                                 and i think we're in the neolithic                                 period in the tech                                 industry still and we're going to be in                                 it for a while i think                                 but the real reason that we're doing                                 this talk is to signal a modern era of                                 ospas yes that is burning man                                 notice it looks a little neolithic um                                 because what we have now is an interest                                 that in in a couple of sectors that have                                 never really shown deep interest before                                 in academia and also in municipalities                                 we're starting to see                                 a real interest in using open source but                                 they're not                                 organized like traditional tech                                 companies who've been                                 able to mobilize engineering resources                                 and to build business models that                                 include open source as part of their                                 story                                 a lot of the reasons that these new                                 players are wanting to get into it is                                 because                                 there's a lower cost of acquisition or                                 perceived lower cost of acquisition                                 so all of that rhetoric that was very                                 common in the neolithic era                                 the cathedral and the bazaar is still                                 being read by these                                 new players and they're continuing to                                 kind of misunderstand what that means                                 they have some challenges which we'll                                 talk about in a minute                                 in order to make this all work but we're                                 suggesting and i'll tell you who we are                                 in a minute                                 that we should be creating a network of                                 ospos for this type of customer                                 and the truth is tech ospos have been                                 networked a lot of us have hopped around                                 between us but stormy peters has got the                                 definitely got the prize for the                                 most number of name-brand ospo's ever                                 worked in                                 right starting with hp and now she's at                                 microsoft but she was at three others in                                 between                                 um but all of us hop around i mean i                                 hopped around and                                 my last ospo job was only over two years                                 ago working for                                 paypal trying to get theirs together uh                                 lots of us                                 have engaged in consulting in between                                 our big gangs so we've done a lot of                                 small                                 holder helping as well but getting                                 ospos to work and open source to work                                 at scale in municipalities and                                 academia is going to require some                                 different                                 tools and different ideas and different                                 changes                                 there have been efforts to get open                                 source to work in                                 civic level before famously                                 there was um the code for america which                                 you know it was a really great effort                                 they learned a lot                                 they eventually had to retrench because                                 their original idea of open source for                                 the masses was sort of not working                                 partly because they were having a hard                                 time with requirements and expectations                                 um there were a lot of reasons but                                 um likewise it's exhausting work running                                 in osbo and people do                                 you know time out need to go re recharge                                 right um and another reason that it's                                 going to be different is                                 most of these entities don't actually                                 have their own programmers who are                                 persistent                                 open source kind of depends on a certain                                 amount of persistence                                 of at least the key players that's why                                 we built                                 at places like apache the you know                                 growing of responsibility as you                                 distinguish yourself                                 because it makes it sticky for those                                 people um                                 but both municipalities and academia                                 have                                 like four years at best of                                 a workforce and then it shifts you know                                 and they tend to get very young workers                                 not not exclusively there definitely are                                 municipalities with large                                 uh engineering organizations but they                                 also tend to use a lot of body shops and                                 that is a really ephemeral workforce                                 and so figuring out how to shift the                                 attitudes and teach                                 people how to do this in a different way                                 is it going to be a lot of the work of                                 the asper plus plus                                 so open source for public good                                 definitely not a new thing                                 spent a lot of us even though                                 enlightened self-interest is such a key                                 part of open source                                 trying to be good or trying to do good                                 while doing well                                 has been a thing the whole time starting                                 with open office in                                      mozilla in                                                                                                                            company mozilla                                 but they were also trying to do a good                                 thing apologies for the phone                                 sorry i'm in a hotel room um                                 but uh they                                 to get it to actually work open source                                 for public good that works is a                                 different thing                                 because you need that institutionality                                 you need to be able to convince                                 suits money lawyers others that this is                                 a sustainable thing that you're doing                                 that it's not just                                 fly by night it's not fringy people who                                 don't fit into society                                 now as open source has won and moved                                 into the mainstream                                 and more people get paid to do open                                 source then do it for free                                 this is changing and again ospo plus                                 plus the idea of that is to expand on                                 the idea of open source for public good                                 and actually make it work this time                                 so one of the big things that they're                                 having to re-learn                                 as we talk about this network effect is                                 the idea that all boats rise                                 why do all boats rise because that's how                                 open source works there are no                                 fences interestingly in the world of                                 open source we're seeing a lot of                                 emotional response in the newest crop of                                 of leaders                                 to um what they perceive first as a                                 sustainability effort but                                 um the fact that maintainers are tired                                 and you know                                                                                                       anybody tired                                 how to fix that problem looking at the                                 money trail                                 and then thinking oh my gosh we have to                                 write licenses                                 that that cause people through legal                                 means to                                 or moral means to contribute can measure                                 it with the value that they're                                 deriving from the thing that's being                                 written and maintained not                                 by their employees right so that's                                 selective boats                                 thinking um you know if you're                                 if you're doing it for free then you get                                 a pass but if you have money then you                                 need to                                 you know give us some um we decided a                                 long time ago that open source wouldn't                                 work that way                                 all the boats have to rise and how this                                 manifests in academia and                                 in municipalities is some of the boats                                 want to see some other boats not rise                                 like                                 every time i've ever spoken about open                                 source and a municipal government and                                 i've been doing this for                                              they eventually ask me how they can lock                                 out their                                 competitor country to the north south                                 east or west that they don't trust                                 right um for whatever reason and we                                 always have to say that's not how it                                 works                                 so this is a this is a big pill for you                                 to swallow if you've been competing for                                 resources                                 all of your life figuring out how to                                 share                                 is harder right and get it letting even                                 some of the poorer countries get the                                 benefit of the fact that you're paying                                 for stuff                                 now i worked on the coveted tracing app                                 that is now called covet green app                                 over at linux foundation i worked for                                 them on that for the irish government                                 we had a paying customer the irish                                 government                                 i spent most of my time on that project                                 advocating for a broader vision                                 and for them to spend a little more                                 money to                                 build something that could be more                                 broadly used around the world for good                                 reasons                                 and that has worked out but it's the                                 first time that the irish government's                                 ever actually engaged in that kind of                                 altruism and they're altruistic people                                 but it's a hard thing to think of if you                                 have                                 accountants running a matrix of cost                                 versus benefit                                 because it seems like an intangible                                 benefit so this is one of the biggest                                 challenges that i think                                 the ospos ospo plus plus network will                                 face but the point of making it a                                 network is finding                                 articulation of intangible values                                 faster and in a more compelling way so                                 that people don't get stuck on the penny                                 counting                                 right so we who i referred to earlier is                                 a                                 little consortium of people we call                                 ourselves mosslabs.io                                 and this background here is from the                                 website mosslabs.io and it is uh                                 pointers to documentation about a series                                 of events or                                 things that moss labs has engaged in                                 over the last                                 um two years and what's interesting is                                 during this time is exactly when europe                                 was analyzing                                 the idea of open source as applied to a                                 federal government                                 and how you would choose how to set that                                 up                                 the obama administration was also deeply                                 into open source i didn't tell that                                 story but i'm happy to and                                 somebody asks in in the questions this                                 is worth going to look at                                 and it's definitely worth getting                                 involved in if you represent                                 either academia or a municipal                                 government                                 there's a lot of opportunity to right                                 now a lot of interest from some very                                 deep pockets but they're not                                 traditional deep pockets like we're                                 doing this                                 because we're a tech company and we want                                 to get on this wave                                 this is more like we have problems to                                 solve and this looks like a better way                                 than the way we've been trying to do it                                 but they need a lot of help to                                 understand and they need a lot of help                                 to figure out                                 how to fit in within the boundaries of                                 what open source means without once                                 again                                 trying to redefine it all right so that                                 is the end of my talk i have                                            for questions i think                                 um join me on friday if you thought this                                 was interesting                                 for a different talk lessons learned                                 from building inner source comments                                 that's a really short                                                but it's part of a block of inner source                                 stuff                                 and if you haven't looked at inner                                 source but you've had to try to explain                                 to a company                                 how to do open source and it's been too                                 hard you want to see this because this                                 will help you understand how to apply                                 inner source methods inside first                                 behind behind the firewall to get                                 everybody ready for the idea of how to                                 collaborate                                 i think this is the most important                                 sustainability thing that we could be                                 doing                                 so i hope you'll join me for that and in                                 the meantime thank you very much                                 and now i will turn my my slides off                                 hopefully so that we can go back to                                 talking                                 uh yeah thank you so much for that                                 denise that was a great                                 a really nice way to kick off the day um                                 i have a question um from the audience                                 someone asks uh in your experience what                                 is it that usually triggers an                                 organization to                                 take that first step and set up an ospo                                 usually in my experience it is still                                 concern from the legal community or the                                 policy community or the compliance                                 community about                                 getting it wrong or the brand sometimes                                 the branding people                                 um and that's not a bad impetus as long                                 as they don't get stuck there                                 right you do need to understand what the                                 working                                 tolerances are and and before you can                                 do something innovative like the summer                                 code right you need to figure out what                                 the                                 what the rules are um but i wish that                                 people setting up oscillators would                                 think more about it that way                                 like now that i understand the rules how                                 far can i go in the direction i want to                                 go                                 rather than um you know going through                                 years of slogging through the rules                                 and being pretty boring right                                 um okay um we have time for another                                 question so if anyone wants to                                 write one um now's your chance                                 wait i must not have been controversial                                 enough if that's                                 i mean you have time you know you're                                 giving another couple of talks so                                 i'm sure if people um want to ask you                                 questions they have time to                                 to do that as well yeah we get a lot of                                 questions                                 over at mosslabs about why we called it                                 plus plus                                 okay the first plus is about                                 expanding it past code to data hardware                                 all the open and plus is that network                                 effect                                 trying to get the cities to start                                 sharing information                                 instead of somehow seeing it as a                                 competitive advantage                                 as those cities need to compete against                                 each other right                                 i mean maybe they do but                                 it's probably not to the to the                                 advantage of their citizenry i would                                 imagine                                 yeah the idea here is some of the larger                                 municipalities like the city of paris                                 are building                                 open source tools that are actually                                 pretty valuable                                 but everybody else isn't jumping on the                                 bandwagon of learning how to use them                                 now i know more about the situation in                                 the u.s in terms of                                 sizes of things so i'll say that there                                 are                                 something like                                                          the us that are too small to have their                                 own programmers                                 so one of the things moss labs has been                                 thinking about is                                 how to increase                                 their access with turnkey solutions but                                 we have to work out you know who would                                 run them who would manage them all that                                 stuff right                                 and um another another interesting thing                                 is uh the largest research institutions                                 worldwide                                 already share a fair amount but they                                 also                                 all have technology transfer offices                                 that try to patent things                                 um to to preserve value within that                                 university so that they can get                                 licensing fees                                 but it's not working and what it really                                 effectively does                                 is people abandon whatever they work                                 done for their phd project                                 and go invent it over in the technical                                 world you know commercial world                                 because they can't access that                                 information that from what they did                                 before                                 without any fee that they can't afford                                 so                                 if you look at the really successful um                                 hallmarks of the internet era you know                                 you see things like the world wide web                                 well tim berners-lee decided not to pay                                 that idea so                                 that it would grow it's like the                                 ultimate in permissive licensing                                 so what we're seeing now are really                                 serious research institutions like johns                                 hopkins                                 setting up an osbo first of all johns                                 hopkins set up an ospo last year it's                                 kind of amazing right                                 they put it in the library because it's                                 the one place that everybody touches                                 this year they're doing something called                                 semesters of code                                 semesters of code is an embroidery on                                 summer of code                                 it's the idea that you could for your                                 own students                                 help them to the experience of working                                 in this way and you'd get more of them                                 involved if you weren't                                 paying money you know getting through                                 the the hoops that you have to get                                 through in order to get on the gravy                                 train of                                 the google summer code what if you                                 a took projects that were being written                                 in your university anyway                                 open source them b get your own students                                 involved get them a fast track to                                 getting involved in those projects                                 and then c hopefully help them                                 springboard from that experience                                 into the commercial world in a way that                                 connects to that experience                                 the first institution we know that did                                 this exactly this                                 was university of california in santa                                 cruz they have an amazing program                                 that is just this right they they had a                                 grad student                                 who was already frankly a known                                 quantity out in silicon valley but he                                 came back to do a phd                                 he took what he did and turned it into a                                 company that kind of the project is                                 called                                 ceph he took what he did he turned it                                 into a company he made a lot of money                                 the university got back to him and said                                  hey you're an alumni and we helped you                                  to this experience why don't you give us                                  some of your money                                  and he said i would be happy to do that                                  if you made it possible for                                  other students to do what i did so they                                  built a whole program                                  just about reproducing that experience                                  right                                  that is something that can be reproduced                                  around the world of academia                                  and similarly again the city of paris                                  for their own needs                                  wrote a soup to nuts here's a package                                  that runs a major city and it's paris                                  it's a big city right                                                                                                         pretty much needs                                  i need a marriage license how do i go                                  get one i

                            they put a certain proportion of their                                  budget aside                                  uh or public commentary in                                  what they call participatory budgeting                                  right citizens realize that they                                  are the government how much would how                                  much would that shift things if people                                  got back to realizing that they are the                                  government instead of                                  without the government endlessly and um                                  helping municipalities to figure out how                                  to do some of these things                                  this all fits in the rubric of osbo plus                                  plus that's why we got it                                  okay great um thank you so much for that
