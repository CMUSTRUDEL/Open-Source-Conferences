	                              thank you                               so yeah this is going to be a light one                               learning through writing                               and i'll use the example of inner source                               patterns and we've heard so much                               about inner source already so just go                               about this                               really briefly again so just what is in                               our source                                is this idea of using open source style                                collaboration approaches but inside of                                your company                                right so at a false conference like like                                here                                i mean you probably have an idea what                                open source means or you might have                                so using those ideas inside of your                                company with your with your colleagues                                on non-open source projects um                                so what could inner source patterns be                                done in that context i tried to                                describe that as simply as i could so                                it's really written                                stories about things that have worked                                for other people                                in other contexts and the inner source                                commons                                has collected a bunch of these patterns                                and i'll just show you how this                                how this looks like so we've published                                the most                                mature patterns as a book and i                                mentioned these are just                                stories of experiences that people have                                made at various companies of things that                                work                                for example there's the trusted                                committer                                pattern down here that describes how it                                can be useful                                to establish that concept of a trusted                                committer and to help to give people                                more                                say in a project and                                bring them bring them basically into the                                fold by giving them more                                rights in the community and that type of                                stuff                                so i've said earlier that these patterns                                are just stories but you can already                                tell here well normally stories don't                                have all these sections                                and subheadings and stuff like that so                                yeah it is a little bit different                                in the patterns because how they work is                                it gives you a predefined                                structure with like the problem what's                                the context that this                                problem appears in what are the forces                                that are impacting this problem like                                what makes it hard                                to solve it then the solution section                                and what you want the resulting context                                to look like                                like after your solution is in place                                right so                                it's not your regular story that you                                would tell to a friend it's a little bit                                more                                it's a little bit more structured but                                something interesting happens there when                                you are                                trying to describe your problem in such                                a predefined                                structure it can help you think it                                through                                in really beneficial ways so a bit more                                about people that are writing those                                patterns well really                                anybody can we find that many times                                developers and architects are writing                                them but also product owners or                                designers people working in a program                                office                                like often inner source is located could                                be in the could be the ospo                                office of your company could be a                                dedicated inner source                                office could also be that the company                                doesn't have any office for this type of                                purpose but it's just                                maybe it's a guild or it's some type of                                cross-cutting concern in your company                                where people                                are interested in these inner source                                concepts                                so yeah this talk is about learning from                                writing                                so the question could be well what's in                                 it for me right why should i                                 write up a problem that i have at my                                 workplace                                 as a pattern so one thing that i found                                 for myself personally                                 just writing things down especially                                 trying to get it into a certain                                 structure that is predefined                                 really helps you to think it through so                                 i found it really beneficial to do that                                 also when i'm writing in a way that                                 the writing that i'm producing is open                                 source right so i know that i'm talking                                 to people                                 outside of my company that means i have                                 to                                 remove all the jargon and you know like                                 things that i take for granted and that                                 type of stuff and i have to abstract it                                 to a place where                                 other people can understand it and again                                 i find that increases the clarity of                                 expression and the clarity of thinking                                 quite quite a bit                                 so writing things down just for that                                 purpose it's already helpful for                                 yourself then the other thing is once                                 you've                                 written it down and you can show it to                                 other people i mean just like a blog                                 post or                                 something else or a video or conference                                 talk or anything where you are                                 putting your topic out there it allows                                 you to start conversations with other                                 people                                 all right so for example if i write                                 something up like a problem that i have                                 and even if i don't have a solution yet                                 i can already publish that                                 that will allow me to find other people                                 that                                 might have experienced something similar                                 and in the absolute                                 best case you find other people with                                 that same                                 challenge and maybe they've found a                                 solution already                                 like russ was talking earlier about how                                 they are addressing things at nike so                                 maybe they've                                 figured something out already so maybe                                 we can solve it together                                 so that's actually all my lightning                                 talks                                 just a couple of links here that i'll                                 share later in the in the chat to the                                 veterans book to the slack channel from                                 the inner source commons                                 and there's actually even a pattern how                                 writing things down                                 can help you with trans transparent                                 cross-team decision making so that's                                 also kind of related to how writing is                                 beneficial                                 thank you all here you can find me here                                 or later in the                                 lounge                                 you
