Publication date: 2021-03-02
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	The Clinic for Open Source Arts (COSA) is focused on the health of open source creative tools. We look at communities, access, innovation, and sustainability to help new projects emerge, strong projects grow, and unstable projects change. COSA does this work through training, supporting, guiding conversations, and sharing community wisdom. This short talk will introduce the organization and what we have been up to over the first 2 years.

	                              uh                               hello everybody i am chris coleman i'm                               the director of the clinic for open                               source                               arts a new program or thing                               at the university of denver in colorado                               in the u.s                               and i'm going to talk to you a little                               bit about what we do today                                primarily we are a clinic we're                                interested in                                health and thinking about the health                                of different kinds of ways of thinking                                about the tools that artists are using                                specifically open source ones so                                thinking about the communities around                                tools thinking about how people access                                those tools                                do you have the pieces in place with                                documentation                                examples tutorials do you have ways for                                people to access                                ways to become contributors we're really                                interested in sustainability issues                                around these tools                                a lot of tools for artists come and go                                really quickly                                because they don't have support systems                                set up what does it look like to have a                                sustainable                                ecosystem of tools for artists                                we're also fostering new kinds of tools                                very much interested in what it looks                                like to have                                underrepresented people in this space                                creating the tools that they see a need                                for                                and how do we foster that kind of                                environment                                so that we create a situation of change                                and                                you know again i keep using the word                                tools and that really does refer                                to a large grouping of of different                                pieces of open                                open source software uh eventually we do                                want to move to open source hardware                                as well but right now thinking about                                software specifically                                what does it look like to have                                those kind of tools that are used for                                creative purposes primarily                                how do you make sure that those have uh                                healthy systems                                healthy ecosystems healthy communities                                um                                so that's really what we keep focusing                                on and that art that uh                                that focus is quite global um and                                again really thinking deeply about the                                people um                                we've been concerned over the years to                                think about who's getting involved in                                the tools and who's missing                                from those groups of people and so                                creating opportunities where new people                                are invited in                                new kinds of leadership are instituted                                in these communities                                and we literally change the face of                                the communities around those tools                                that that artists are using and we think                                it's a really beautiful space to start                                that conversation                                um i think uh one of the                                sort of specific pieces that we're                                really thinking about                                is at the moment we're running a                                training program to train community                                leaders                                i'm thinking about how do you help                                people transition                                from becoming contributors or community                                members                                into community leaders thinking about                                the people who are orchestrating the                                process between people who might be                                working on code and people who might be                                working on documentation and educational                                material                                and people who might be interacting with                                and getting feedback from the larger                                community                                what does what how does that all come                                together and so training community                                leaders to be prepared for that                                task for many different size projects                                is a really core initiative that we're                                focused on right now                                 we're doing that with funding from the                                 knight foundation                                 the national endowment for the arts as                                 well as a melon grant                                 and we continue to do a lot of that kind                                 of work                                 and that's led us to do lots of                                 different kinds of projects                                 including supporting things like ml                                  looking at things like p embroider that                                 open source way to run an embroidery                                 machine                                 and even live coding tools like carl                                 and then thinking about how education                                 starts with art and technology and open                                 source tools                                 with things like out of the black box                                 that's                                 starting with k through                                                 them with these kind of technologies                                 and then beyond that we're hosting                                 clinics which are deeper conversations                                 with experts in the field gathering                                 their ideas and putting them together                                 hosting summits for tools like open                                 frameworks                                 to you know this was the first ever                                 contributors conference that was                                 more about something more than code and                                 so we continue to push boundaries and                                 think about how can we help                                 the community uh in some really                                 interesting ways so                                 uh if you want to learn more our website
