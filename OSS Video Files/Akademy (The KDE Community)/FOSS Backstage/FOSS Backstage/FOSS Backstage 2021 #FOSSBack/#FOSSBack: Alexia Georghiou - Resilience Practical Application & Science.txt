	                              hi                               everybody um i want to tell you some                               about                               my background i have been a mental                               health therapist for                                             and i recently started studying the                               science of                               happiness so we're going to talk about                               happiness and how do we bring that about                                burnout is a hot topic i                                read this article on harvard business                                review                                and it just came out february the                                     and so i want to start with this                                for you to know this is being studied in                                the top                                business schools here in the states                                and they found how do we prevent burnout                                we need a sense of purpose with what                                we're doing                                a manageable workload and this is very                                interesting                                feeling that we can discuss our mental                                health                                at work and having an                                empathetic manager                                so do you feel like this is your life                                where things are in your way                                and some of it is inside your head                                so self-doubt worry                                excuses and                                things are just blocking you and maybe                                not                                maybe you say i'm just doing great                                something to think about today have you                                ever known someone                                who died all of a sudden and                                here in the states people say well they                                were eating really healthy and they were                                exercising                                why did they die the research shows us                                that the self-care and resilience and                                what's going on                                on the inside affects our health                                just as much as smoking a                                pack of cigarettes a day just as much as                                our diet                                and exercise                                so this is a new concept that we're                                learning about                                in mental and physical health and                                researchers are finding                                how connected we are                                there's a vagal nerve and                                this nerve is activated with a stress                                response so there's a difference between                                stress                                stress is actually normal                                all of us have stress and we may use                                the term stressed out i'm stressed out                                and learning how to manage stress is                                very important for us and it's not a bad                                thing                                and it's good to see stress as healthy                                that this is just part of life uh so                                when we have a stress response that's                                very                                different and this vagal nerve                                runs all the way down our body so what                                that means is                                that stress response affects our whole                                body                                it's not just in one area and                                so think about where do you feel the                                stress is it tension here                                is it a headache do you tense up in                                other parts of your body and                                it's important for us to increase our                                awareness and that's why we're talking                                about this today                                we want to stay in this green zone and                                identify                                what helps us to stay in this green zone                                breathing meditation prayer                                curiosity openness                                and we need to stay here but the reality                                is                                that response kicks us up to the red                                zone                                and we're gonna respond one way or                                another                                we're gonna fight or we're gonna flight                                so run away or run towards                                if this really shocks us                                then we're gonna freeze and                                this is where we become depressed we're                                not responding                                we feel helpless we feel hopeless                                we feel trapped and what's interesting                                 here                                 is shame if you've ever felt ashamed                                 whether you talked about it or not this                                 is in the free zone                                 so what do we need to do that's what                                 we're here to talk about today                                 so we can go from that freeze then we're                                 going to go to the red zone                                 and then to the green zone so it                                 progresses                                 i will make these slides and resources                                 so you will be able to read                                 everything in um pdf format                                 so there's stress that we can control                                 and stress that we can't control so                                 what is in our control checking email so                                 we can say                                 i'm going to focus on checking email                                 these three times throughout the day                                 the research is showing that when we pay                                 attention to one                                 task and become fully absorbed in it                                 it's really good for our brain health                                 so the multitasking is out i                                 am a huge multitasker and so i'm having                                 to learn this                                 to focus on one thing at a time give the                                 brain a break and then focus on another                                 task                                 so email is something we can control                                 how we check it and when we respond what                                 can we                                 not control we cannot control the world                                 events                                 and what's happening around us and                                 there are some um interesting studies                                 that learn helplessness it                                 causes depression so if we're watching a                                 lot of what's happening in                                 in the world and cannot do anything                                 about it                                 then that's going to lead to loss of                                 hope and depression                                 because as human beings we want to fix                                 things we want to problem solve                                 okay so what do we need for healthy                                 brain functioning                                 a healthy body a healthy mind it's all                                 intertwined                                 nutrition and i'm not here to tell you                                 to eat                                 beans but the studies have shown that                                 cultures that eat beans                                 and less meat live longer exercise                                 that really helps us um                                 to with the brain functioning to                                 decrease those feelings that we have to                                 regulate them                                 we need water our brain components are                                 made mostly of water                                 sunshine so it's getting                                 out there there's a seasonal affective                                 disorder in the winter                                 when it's dark and gloomy it affects us                                 so uh if there's a sun shine moment in                                 the day                                 go outside and just soak it in um                                                                                                          can be caused by low vitamin d levels                                 and so it's important if you're feeling                                 depression to have that checked by the                                 doctor                                 because that can be easily fixed by                                 taking supplements and getting more                                 sunshine                                 so temperance everything in moderation                                 self-restraint and                                 so there's research breakups are related                                 to alcohol abuse                                 we don't make good decisions if we're                                 abusing substances                                 fresh air it's very important to get                                 fresh air in the epidemic in                                                                                        there were so many people sick with the                                 flu uh the                                 army built tents and the people who were                                 in the tents                                 healed faster than the people who were                                 inside in the hospital                                 so unfortunately the hospitals have had                                 to seal                                 the windows i asked a nurse recently                                 here                                 locally i'm in tennessee in the usa and                                 she said yep we would tell people their                                 diagnosis                                 their prognosis and they would try to                                 jump out the window and that's why                                 we had to seal the windows we need                                 rest we need at least seven hours                                 of sleep a night uh and                                 there's research in countries like the                                 uk germany                                 and the us                                                      isn't getting at least seven hours of                                 sleep has                                 this pandemic affected your sleep                                 there's                                 exercises that we can do there are                                 routines                                 self-care is very important the research                                 shows                                 that the tech disrupts so                                 have a time when you say i'm going to                                 put this up                                 and i'm gonna say no more tech and                                 it could be                                                             bed um                                 in your bedroom don't have your                                 electronics because it will disrupt your                                 sleep                                 tv is okay uh if you want to feel that                                 that sound and rest and                                 working in our bed having meetings in                                 our bedroom                                 uh it affects our psyche because our                                 psyche needs to say oh this is the place                                 that i rest and i unplug also i heard a                                 psychologist share                                 that the research is showing taking a                                 shower                                 at night so we're warm from the shower                                 and then our body is cooling                                 down and it's signaling to our body it's                                 time to sleep                                 we're going to focus on the final one                                 today                                 trust and the happiness studies                                 and what they're showing so when we                                 are close to people that we feel safe                                 with                                 psychologically that we know that they                                 love us that we can depend on them                                 um then this gives us higher life                                 expectancy                                 up to                                                 knowing our life has meaning gives us up                                 to                                 seven years longer                                 dr martin seligman at the university of                                 pennsylvania has                                 a theory of well-being uh we                                 have emotions emotions happen express                                 them                                 talk about them regulate to positive                                 okay we're gonna talk about what a                                 positive mindset                                 does uh being engaged                                 being socially engaged being engaged in                                 our work                                 positive relationships so the studies                                 are showing                                 that it's okay to argue it's how we                                 argue                                 it's uh it's can we solve the problem                                 and communicate and move forward with                                 that that's normal when you have                                 people we're gonna have conflict and                                 so people even with a lot of chronic                                 pain                                 elderly people reported high levels of                                 happiness                                 if they knew that they had someone to                                 depend on them                                 the world happiness report that came out                                 in march of                                             one out of                                                        stated i have no one to depend on                                 and that's an alarming statistic that is                                 before the pandemic so what has the                                 shutdown                                 caused for people we need to feel that                                 sense of meaning                                 and accomplishment so this                                 is our theory of well-being from                                 positive psychology                                 okay so one small positive thought in                                 the morning                                 can change your whole day there's a                                 study                                 by michelle gillen and sean aker three                                 minutes                                 of negative news in the morning                                 people reported                                                    likelihood                                 an unhappy day six to eight hours                                 later as compared to the positive                                 condition                                 so we need to be careful how much                                 news we're watching and not to start our                                 day with negative news                                 because it could affect our day                                 all right what does this you know really                                 i'm not gonna pay attention to things                                 because we don't realize what we're                                 missing                                 uh and having our brain at a positive                                 state we're gonna notice more things                                 so if you're thinking whatever industry                                 you are in                                 uh we want to pay attention to detail                                 you know happiness studies are showing                                 the positive state                                 increases our accuracy on tasks                                 and if you want to read more sean aker                                 in the happiness advantage he studied                                 people around the world and this is in                                 businesses                                 and he showed that doctors are going to                                 make                                 better diagnoses if their brain isn't                                 positive                                 sales people are going to make a higher                                 percentage of sales                                 so i want you to watch this video count                                 how many times the people with the white                                 shirt                                 pass the ball this is a test of                                 selective attention                                 count how many times the players wearing                                 white pass the basketball                                 how many passes did you count the                                 correct answer                                 is                                                               okay did you see the gorilla                                 that's the question and uh we're gonna                                 hear the commentary                                 the next slide is a test of selective                                 attention                                 count how many times the player's                                 wearing white                                 here we go okay here's the commentary                                 one of my best known studies was done                                 with my collaborator chris chabri some                                 years ago                                 and what we had was a video in which                                 people were passing basketballs                                 so three people were wearing white                                 shirts and they were passing a ball                                 and your task when you were watching the                                 video was just to count how many times                                 those three players passed the ball we                                 also had three players wearing black                                 shirts passing their own ball                                 and you were supposed to ignore their                                 passes so as you're doing this task                                 after about                                            say you have a person wearing a full                                 body gorilla suit walk into the middle                                 of the scene                                 stop in the center turn and face the                                 camera thump its chest and then walk off                                 the other side a total of about nine                                 seconds later                                 and what we find is that about half the                                 people who do this                                 simply don't notice the gorilla when dan                                 asked me to be a part of this experiment                                 i thought no way people are totally                                 going to see me i'm a                                                   we rewind the tape and show it to them                                 again and the reaction is typically i                                 miss that                                 it's shocking that you could possibly                                 miss something as obvious as a gorilla                                 looking isn't the same as seeing we have                                 to focus attention on something in order                                 to become aware of it                                 you                                 the key is that when you're focusing                                 your attention on one aspect of your                                 world                                 you don't have an unlimited amount of                                 attention to devote to other things                                 and we only see those things that we                                 focus our attention on the problem is                                 that on occasion we filter something                                 that we might want to notice                                 and we don't realize that we're doing                                 that that sort of                                 mismatch between what we see and what we                                 think we see                                 is a really profound one that has all                                 sorts of consequences for daily lives                                 okay so did you see the gorilla                                 about half the people who watch that                                 video in the studies                                 do not see the gorilla and it's really                                 interesting                                 because we don't realize what we don't                                 see                                 the happiness studies what is this all                                 about that it's suddenly a science uh                                 when i earned my master's degree in                                 counseling it was in the early                                         we were not taught empirical research                                 and as i continued the continuing                                 education                                 about                                                                that this                                 is empirically proven and now                                 we have technology with a.i                                 that we can scan people's brains                                 and read emotions and that's really                                 powerful                                 because there are studies that say                                 practice gratitude sean aker                                 he asked his participants write three                                 things every day that you're grateful                                 for                                 three different things every day so just                                 jot it down                                 he scanned the brain before with the                                 fmri functional mri and then he scanned                                 the participants brains                                                                                                   remarkable results                                 so our brain will go to positive when                                 we're practicing                                 gratitude right there that is something                                 to do to keep us                                 in that green zone or to get us back in                                 that green zone                                 so i'm in the red i'm uh                                 very upset and okay                                 you know there's a reason that we're                                 angry there's a reason that we're afraid                                 and talk about it journal about it                                 get it out and then practice some                                 gratitude because that's going to help                                 us go back to the green and                                 it definitely affects our blood pressure                                 our hearts and it stresses                                 our whole system                                 happiness studies okay harvard has an                                 ongoing                                               on the well-being and happiness of                                 people robert waldinger is currently the                                 head of it                                 he's a zen master it's interesting to                                 hear him talk about it                                 and they started at harvard because in                                                                      this is who you studied were the men who                                 went to harvard there were no women                                 and then they went to a lower                                 socioeconomic area                                 in boston and they got a group of men                                 and they followed their lives all these                                 years                                 so it's not just questionnaires that                                 they're asking them they're also doing                                 physicals and blood tests and they're                                 interviewing their wives their families                                 and they were shocked they were shocked                                 to find                                 out that happiness the key to happiness                                 is connection and our relationships                                 so if we look at the first slide i                                 showed you                                 social connection keeps us in that green                                 zone                                 that's medically scientifically                                 proven it's not money like we need a                                 certain                                 amount of money to live and be                                 comfortable and of course that affects                                 our happiness                                 but they're showing the research up to a                                 certain amount                                 because we want to live comfortably and                                 after that                                 we could have a lot more money and it                                 wouldn't increase our happiness                                 what does sustain our happiness and                                 cause it is connection                                 okay so we're not ignoring the problems                                 we're looking at the problems we're                                 solving the problems                                 we're being very rational and we're                                 looking at the upside                                 optimism we are not naturally                                 optimistic most of us aren't                                 and so it's a skill it's a muscle that                                 we                                 can build and we don't even realize                                 how negative our thinking is and so                                 think                                 about having a buddy with you uh to                                 catch you when you say things that                                 are negative or pessimistic                                 so for example i'm driving and i have a                                 flat tire                                 or i'm playing sports and                                 i'm not performing really well we're not                                 going to let that ruin the game                                 or ruin the day so i get the flat tire                                 fixed                                 what's my thinking so pay attention                                 what's your thinking during that time                                 am i thinking now my day is ruined i                                 can't believe this happened                                 bad things always happen to me catch                                 those thoughts                                 and we can say nope that's not the truth                                 um you know i'm getting this tire fixed                                 or if you're playing football i'm gonna                                 take a break and                                 go back to the football game and i am                                 using that word we call it soccer                                 here in the u.s and take that mental                                 break                                 and you will not ruin my day and again                                 kick the bring the positive                                 with some thoughts of gratitude it                                 literally                                 will light up your brain and reset uh                                 so recharging think about your phone                                 every day i have to plug this phone in                                 and it gets a charge                                 also apple sends me updates so i need to                                 update the software so every day we need                                 to                                 charge ourselves with self-care                                 making sure that we get the nutrients                                 and exercise                                 and sunlight and focus on                                 our thinking and feel comfortable with                                 expressing emotions                                 and i know that's very new                                 in our culture we're not used to doing                                 that especially at work                                 and so we're but we heard from the                                 harvard business review                                 also i took some classes with wharton                                 executive education and there are                                 studies                                 love at work this is a study by segal                                 barsad                                 where across industries they have                                 studied when employees                                 feel a sense of belonging at work when                                 employees feel cared for                                 and love is practiced towards one                                 another                                 then they will take care of their                                 customers                                 their clients and their patients                                 naturally                                 okay so dr stewart friedman he's out of                                 wharton                                 he studied people's lives and we hear                                 work-life balance                                 um it's and it's not so much of a                                 balance especially now with the pandemic                                 we are in a time many people are still                                 working from home                                 how do you integrate work in life so                                 when things are tense at work                                 flex the family and the personal life                                 when things are tense at home flex work                                 are we able to do that so he just talks                                 a little bit about that                                 come on you've gotta sacrifice                                 everything in your life right                                 and what i knew from my own experience                                 but also as a consultant as a coach as a                                 as an educator                                 and as a researcher was that that's                                 actually not true                                 even though that is the common wisdom                                 and certainly i'm not saying here that                                 you know you can you can have everything                                 all the time and that uh                                 uh you know you can have success without                                 without sacrifice without effort                                 without you know discipline and                                 persistence in the face of                                 in the face of disappointment but what i                                 am saying                                 is that not only is it possible                                 to create a greater sense of harmony                                 among the different parts of your life                                 while achieving greatness it's actually                                 necessary                                 that the people who are most successful                                 even by you know external markers of                                 fame and wealth uh and you know power                                 those are the folks who are able to                                 figure out                                 in their own way how to bring together                                 the different parts of their lives                                 over the course of their lives and                                 indeed it's their commitments to family                                 to community and to their private selves                                 their minds                                 bodies spirits that's what gives them                                 the strength                                 the resources of the support that they                                 need                                 to be successful in the professional                                 world so so reason one was to address                                 this issue of                                 you know uh you have to sacrifice                                 everything                                 not true and you're saying it's it's a                                 false choice basically it's a false                                 choice that                                 it holds us back from the kinds of                                 success                                 the kinds of happiness that you're                                 talking about indeed uh                                 that to think in terms of you know the                                 binary work                                 life balance which is a term that i                                 have been railing against for decades                                 and i think i think we're making some                                 progress there because more people are                                 talking                                 instead about working life integration                                 or harmony                                 uh over the course of life and that okay                                 so there we have an established                                 professor                                 talking about i'm jeff in a creation                                 uh so what is our takeaway today                                 you may be saying i'm young and i'm                                 strong                                 and i'm pretty resilient and i get that                                 i remember                                                                                                        so wish me a happy birthday                                 and boy you know life happens                                 uh disappointments happen and uh                                 it doesn't just happen to older people                                 it happens too when we're younger but i                                 remember when i was younger                                 that it's more challenging now in a lot                                 of ways not just physically                                 but also uh with the stress response                                 but it is important it will have an                                 effect                                 uh what we're doing with our emotions                                 and our self-care it will                                 catch up with us so in some cultures                                 like in japan                                 people who work too hard they have heart                                 attacks                                 there was nothing wrong with them it was                                 the stress response                                 and they weren't taking care of                                 themselves                                 okay so a positive outlook makes our                                 brains perform                                 better achieving a positive mindset is                                 fostered by happiness                                 and this comes about with strong                                 connections                                 this is our scientifically backed                                 takeaway for today so i would love                                 to take questions and meet with you in a
