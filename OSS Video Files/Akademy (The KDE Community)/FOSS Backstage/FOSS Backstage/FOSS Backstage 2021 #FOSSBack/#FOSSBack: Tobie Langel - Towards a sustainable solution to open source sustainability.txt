Title: #FOSSBack: Tobie Langel - Towards a sustainable solution to open source sustainability
Publication date: 2021-02-23
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	A few years ago, Heartbleed epitomized a massive open source sustainability problem for critical parts of the internet infrastructure. The bug, which affected the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library, notably compromised the confidentiality of 4.5 million US patient records and cost the industry an estimated $500M.

It was soon revealed that the root-cause of the issue was that OpenSSL was precariously understaffed. Open source sustainability became a major theme overnight. Stories of maintainer burn-out made the headlines. And tentative solutions started to emerge, most of them donation-based.

In this talk we’ll explore a number of existing strategies to fund open source and make it more sustainable, from patronage to dedicated ad networks. And we’ll defend the idea that the best path to open source sustainability is to help companies understand the tangible business value they can get from contributing to open source.

	                              all right                               so um welcome let me start by asking you                               um if any of you actually still                               uh recognize um this logo here                               and this of course is on the logo                               of the heartblade bug                               and the heartblade bug as                               some of you probably remember was a                               critical vulnerability that affected the                                openssl library in                                     and of course openssl is this library                                that is responsible for securing network                                communications and unix systems                                and as a result um power is essentially                                on privacy and security in the majority                                of internet servers                                and so um this bug actually had a                                massive                                impact notably and that's not the only                                thing that happened but it                                um essentially broke the confidentiality                                the confidentiality                                of um about four and a half                                point five million uh patient records                                of u.s citizens and the industry                                estimated that its                                impact the cost of its work of of the                                bug                                sorry costed the industry about half                                a billion dollars so i'm going to be                                speaking a lot about money in this talk                                today                                um essentially because well money is at                                the                                the heart of um of sustainability                                um to do to well at least two to some                                degree and                                so the heartbeat bug is really                                interesting because it's sort of a                                pivotal moment                                where the tech industry suddenly                                realizes that                                open source is ubiquitous right so                                um two-thirds of active websites in                                     relied on the openssl library to encrypt                                the its communications                                also critical um openssl                                you know was something that enabled                                private communications bank transactions                                uh storing medical records safely uh end                                to end encryption                                in all of these aspects so it wasn't                                just like you know a nice                                fun client-side library to add animation                                to your website                                it was really core to how the internet                                functioned                                and then of course the last bit is this                                is when the industry realized that not                                only was this ubiquitous and critical                                but also open source was critically                                underfunded and that this                                underfunding was at the heart of the                                existence of this bug in the first place                                and to give you an um concretely what                                that meant                                it's open ssl who was essentially                                protecting two two-thirds of internet                                communication                                um was maintained by one full-time                                maintainer                                on the budget of two thousand dollars a                                year                                and so um this um essentially                                pushed the industry as a whole                                to realize the extent of                                the sustainability problem that it had                                and this is when we started                                really hearing about the question of                                maintainer burnout for example                                um and really this opened oh sorry this                                really opened the floodgates right                                uh people in the industry the community                                the maintainers                                the contributors really started speaking                                up about these                                issues of sustainability and                                sustainability                                really took center stage and as a result                                rather quickly we had multiple                                uh responses or response attempts                                um by different actors in the field and                                those and was a really broad                                set of responses and so in the first                                part of this                                talk what i really want to do is sort of                                like cover a bit of the ground                                that exists and sort of like as a result                                of                                 this or rather that this                                      uh heartblade bug sort of like uh                                 um accelerated right to look at these                                 different options                                 and then sort of propose a broader um                                 additional way to consider open source                                 sustainability in the future                                 so let's get started um one of the                                 immediate first                                 response of the industry was to create                                 the core infrastructure initiative                                 and this was an industry-wide effort                                 organized by the linux foundation and                                 backed by pretty much                                 all of the big tech corporations in the                                 world                                 was a multi-million dollar fund                                 administered by the linux foundation and                                 a steering committee of industry experts                                 around security                                 and its goal was really to harden the                                 security of key open source projects                                 so the focus was really let's make sure                                 that the open source key infrastructure                                 that we all rely on                                 um is sustainable secure                                 and we don't bump into issues like                                 heartblade again                                 um but of course at at this point um                                 we the the whole community was really                                 sort of bought into this idea of um                                 well we have a systematic sustainability                                 problem and we need to sort of fix it                                 and so maintainers developers open                                 source developers trying                                 tried to find solutions of their own                                 um one of um the the first um                                 thing that happened is people used                                 existing                                 platforms that had been designed for                                 other things like patreon                                 right um and sort of and tried to                                 leverage patreon or other others                                 like well-minded platforms um to                                 essentially fund                                 open source development and so of course                                 the the initial goal of patreon was                                 um to to help artists musicians and                                 writers create a meaningful revenue                                 stream                                 um and this sort of like was adapted to                                 open source and                                 actually quite successfully by some                                 players um                                 in the field notably avenue was pictured                                 here the creator of ujs                                 who um at that time was able to uh turn                                 over                                                                                        was enough for for him to focus fully                                 uh full time on on unview.js                                 of course um the question arises as to                                 whether this is a                                 reproducible um solution and in fact                                 um it hasn't really been proven to be                                 reproducible on                                 large scale right so some um                                 a few well-known developers were able to                                 sort of create this                                 and build a large enough revenue stream                                 to be                                 able to work in open source full-time                                 but this really wasn't common                                 so sorry another                                 approach was um um is what git coin                                 created and there is                                 uh a lot more interest today again uh                                 about                                 blockchain-based solutions to sort of                                 um create um shared revenue amongst                                 users                                 uh um and creators of open source i'm                                 generally kind of                                 um dubious about um the idea and how                                 this works                                 also because i i have my own personal                                 doubts about                                 the uh the underlying um ideology behind                                 blockchain which                                 i tend to think is very libertarian uh                                 but nonetheless i think there are                                 interesting efforts in that space and                                 it's really worth                                 um having a look at them and trying to                                 to see what this this whole                                 culture is looking at and so get coin                                 was uh particularly interesting because                                 it essentially created                                 um well first of all because it was a                                 whole ecosystem and it still is                                 um so it was get coined but also an ad                                 network that now is defunct                                 and sort of a patron-like solution                                 called grants um and so the idea of                                 github                                 um of bitcoin was to create a github                                 issue market where                                 uh people who needed um uh                                 contributions to open source software                                 would have bounties                                 and developers would um be paid for the                                 work that they did                                 and so in                                                            um a million dollar um                                 paying out bounties to developers                                 it also created code fund which was                                 essentially sort of like a way to                                 advertise                                 specifically to open source developers                                 and really focused on                                 um hiring and so that that got closed it                                 wasn't very um it wasn't sustainable                                 uh-huh uh and it was now sort of                                 replaced and endorsed by code fund uh                                 the replacement is ethical ads which is                                 has a similar origin story                                 essentially trying to build um                                 make open source sustainable and really                                 started being really developer focused                                 um and trying to                                 advertise to developers so jobs but also                                 sas software et cetera                                 um and it has served a billion ads since                                                                                    um today um but you know still                                 a billion ads is large but it's also                                 not a huge amount of money overall                                 um we're now seeing more and more of um                                 essentially so this is oss capital so                                 essentially venture-backed open source                                 startups                                 again here i have my own personal view                                 on like                                 how uh really um open source these are                                 and and how much they're actually trying                                 to solve the overall and underlying                                 problem of open source sustainability                                 but it's also uh an effort that is                                 happening there's a lot more                                 vc capital being invested injected in                                 open source                                 and that's also interesting to follow of                                 course um                                 on this wouldn't be complete without                                 looking also at open collective                                 which essentially provides non-profit                                 status to open source projects and                                 transparency as to how those funds are                                 used                                 huge success story is webpack which is                                 making now i think close to half a                                 million dollars a year                                 um and which created some really a                                 win-win situation for key sponsors like                                 trivago have spoken about this and                                 other contexts before uh happy to chat                                 about it um                                 after this talk um but of course the the                                 problem of open collective here too                                 is the long-tail problem right key                                 projects are                                 uh getting most of the funding so for                                 example webpack was a                                 quarter of the total funds that were                                 given out in in                                      and so the dependencies itself is is not                                 really                                 the dependencies of like the key                                 projects aren't really funded                                 which is why um open collective has                                 started back your start                                 stack project which is essentially                                 helping you                                 a consumer of open source figuring out                                 not only the projects that you use but                                 the whole dependency tree of those                                 projects                                 and then being able to fund that whole                                 dependency tree accordingly                                 um which um incidentally is also                                 uh very similar to the model that                                 tidelift has created                                 um where um it's trying to essentially                                 build                                 a red hat business model for the long                                 tail um                                 so providing security updates                                 maintenance and legal asserts that um                                 for essentially your whole open source                                 stack                                 and it's doing so by actually paying                                 the actual maintainers of the of the                                 projects                                 um and so the actual success of tight                                 lift is                                 is still to be proven in the long term                                 but it's also                                 a really interesting model so i sort of                                 gave you                                 this um you know this um exciting                                 um view of all of these different                                 projects that are trying to solve that                                 problem but i also                                 want us to look at uh the the downsides                                 and                                 of that and for this we're going to look                                 at four questions right                                 the question is does this funding based                                 solution to open source sustainability                                 actually scale                                 um is money really the key question um                                 and even if money was the key question                                 is um um funding open source that way                                 with open source developers on one side                                 and a regular developers on the other                                 a desirable outcome and lastly i want to                                 focus on what the real value of open                                 source is                                 and make you reconsider the idea that                                 we're essentially trying to                                 um find a way to fund the open source                                 uh the code itself and really consider                                 about                                 more the value of community and of the                                 knowledge                                 and network that's built inside of                                 community                                 so let's look at this at scale first um                                 and for this i'm going to                                 use um this absolutely great um diagram                                 from                                 demonic acres demonocracy.info which i'm                                 using                                 was permission and um which i think                                 really shows the size of the problem                                 that we're facing when we're trying to                                 fund                                 open source uh through essentially                                 charity based funding like we've been                                 looking at so far                                 um so this is a hundred dollar bill if                                 you stack                                                                                                          the monthly revenue of code fund the                                 advertiser that we talked about now if                                 you pack                                 a hundred of those uh dollar pack of                                 those uh ten ten thousand dollars a pack                                 you get one million dollar right and                                 this                                 um is uh the amount that was collected                                 by open collective                                 in                                                                       tide left committed to pay developers                                 uh out of the money it received from its                                 vc funding                                 now if we do some quick a back of the                                 envelope math we realized quickly that                                 the worldwide develop developer                                 population                                 is actually substantial right we're                                 looking uh in                                                 um                                                                    math for this                                 um and estimating that a developer                                 costs roughly                                                     um on average uh we get to a total                                 cost of paying developers in the world                                 that is                                 one trillion dollars right so i want to                                 sort of compare this notion of one                                 million dollars which is                                 roughly you know in the vicinity of what                                 we're paying out                                 to open source to fund open source or                                 you know in the millions of dollars                                 to what we're actually paying as an                                 industry in                                 um wages to developers worldwide                                 so if you take um if you stack um                                 uh you know if you create a stack                                 on a wooden pallet of                                             dollars that's what it looks like right                                 um now if you get                                                                                                  dollars and now to get                                 to                                                                      square of                                                                                        um um what was it a hundred million                                 dollars each                                 um and if you actually want to get to a                                 trillion dollar well you have to stack                                 a hundred of those and it gives you                                 a tower of bills of dollar bill of                                     bills of the size of a huge skyscraper                                 right                                 so to compare here's your one million                                 dollar down there and here's you you're                                 trying your trillion dollar right                                 so the the discrepancy between what                                 we're trying to spend                                 and the size of the problem means that                                 it really is hard to make scale                                 so the second question is is money                                 really what's missing and the answer to                                 that is                                 actually um in                                 nuanced right so for example it depends                                 on the project obviously but for a                                 number of projects                                 um for example here the linux kernel                                 most contributors to the next kernel are                                 actually employed                                 to work on the linux kernel so the                                 question of sustainability here doesn't                                 really is it the question isn't really                                 are people                                 paid or not it's are people given enough                                 time to work on critical infrastructure                                 um the um third question                                 and i think this is a key one is is                                 it really a desirable outcome to have                                 on one side charity funded open source                                 developers and on the other                                 corporate developers or developers                                 working for agencies which are                                 essentially writing glue code                                 um to combine all of the software that's                                 built elsewhere                                 and for that i want to quote um dhh                                 which                                 wrote in                                                    part of the reason much of open source                                 is so good and                                 often so superior to closed source                                 commercial projects                                 is the natural boundary of constraints                                 if you're not being paid or otherwise                                 compensated directly for your work                                 you're less likely to needlessly                                 embellish it you're solving the problems                                 for you                                 and your mates likely in the simplest                                 way you could so you can get back to                                 whatever you originally intended to do                                 before                                 starting to shave the yak so what dhh is                                 saying here is                                 um the fact that open source is created                                 by developers that are                                 actually building real applications                                 um is uh important it creates open                                 source that is of better quality                                 because it really solves the real                                 problem that the community or that                                 they're trying to solve and isn't trying                                 to become a product that's attractive                                 um and that wants um to be bought                                 right so i think that this notion that                                 there's value                                 in really um having developers                                 contribute to open source i think um um                                 is a really important one and lastly                                 i really want to look at the question of                                 the real value of open source                                 and insist on the fact that it is beyond                                 time for us                                 as an industry to look uh beyond the                                 value of opens                                 of the code itself and really look at                                 the broader picture of what open source                                 is                                 um and essentially as open source in                                 terms of the community of practice                                 and a culture and a set of                                 ways to develop software and not just a                                 code itself                                 and for this i'm just going to sort of                                 like close this uh                                 talk with this um diagram                                 which sort of like explains the way                                 we're look generally tend to look at the                                 problem of sustainability                                 in open source from a corporate uh point                                 of view                                 and essentially what we have here is on                                 on you know on the left corporations                                 in on the right sort of like open source                                 and open sources represented by a pool                                 of commons in which the software is                                 swimming                                 and by sort of like the mythical                                 creatures around it which are                                 open source developers and so the way we                                 look at this is essentially                                 corporations just use that open source                                 software                                 right and when there are problems with                                 open source software it's not                                 you know good enough or there are                                 security issues um                                 the default mode of trying to fix the                                 problem is to throw money at it                                 right which is you know very much how a                                 silicon valley industry                                 sort of of things is like let's throw                                 money in the problem and see if that                                 helps the problem disappear                                 and so the idea behind this of course is                                 by throwing money at the problem this is                                 going to instantiate incentivize                                 open source developers to contribute to                                 the pool of commons and                                 as a result the corporations will be                                 able to                                 um benefit from the perceived value the                                 source code of open source                                 and in reality what's really important                                 to understand is that                                 the the real value of open source and                                 there's like                                 you know increasingly um research that                                 tends to prove and show this                                 is not so much in the code that's being                                 produced uh because that code is                                 essentially free to use right it's                                 completely commoditized                                 and so that that's not really where you                                 can capture value                                 no where you can create encounter value                                 is                                 in how the practice of open source                                 makes your your company                                 faster more agile how it builds a                                 network of relationships                                 across different teams and different                                 corporations um                                 how it helps your developers um                                 level up increase their knowledge                                 increase their network                                 uh increase their understanding of the                                 underlying technology on which you're                                 building your own software et cetera                                 right                                 and so the truth is that the real value                                 of open source                                 um is really um what those developers                                 take back home um to their own company                                 as a result of being contributing to                                 um this um pool of commons and as a                                 result of being                                 part of this community in with whom they                                 interact                                 and with whom they they actually create                                 software and so                                 we need to really stop looking at                                 corporations as this um                                 solid entity and really think that the                                 corporation is actually                                 fill full of people that can                                 also themselves be contributors that so                                 that instead of like throwing money at                                 the problem                                 you essentially throw people                                 that can participate in the underlying                                 community and                                 um as a result uh benefit                                 from um the same networking relationship                                 building effects um of participating in                                 the community                                 and bring back that value to the                                 corporations                                 and so essentially um what i'm here to                                 say is                                 although charity-like funding is um                                 going to be useful in some scenarios                                 that is                                 valuable to the community it's not alone                                 by itself                                 on the solution and the real way forward                                 really is to normalize engineers                                 contributing to open source                                 as part of their day job and the                                 question of course is how do we do this                                 um and to me the the key to that is                                 exactly how we got                                 corporations to use open source a decade                                 or two decades ago                                 it's to make them understand the return                                 on investment                                 of contributing to open source and                                 that's it thank you so much for                                 listening and i'm happy                                 to take your questions thank you very                                 much                                 you
