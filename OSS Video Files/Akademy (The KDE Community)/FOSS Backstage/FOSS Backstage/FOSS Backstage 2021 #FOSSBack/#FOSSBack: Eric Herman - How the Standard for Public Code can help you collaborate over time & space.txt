Title: #FOSSBack: Eric Herman - How the Standard for Public Code can help you collaborate over time & space
Publication date: 2021-03-02
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Our goal is to help people developing public-purpose software understand how the Standard for Public Code can help them collaborate. The Standard is of course applicable to everyone developing open source software, and is especially useful if you want other organizations to be able to contribute to your code.

By applying the Standard, code created for and by governments will not only be reusable and open source on paper, but also in practice. We hope to show that it is not that hard to create genuinely reusable code, and inspire collaboration across public organizations.

The talk will also answer the following questions:

    What is public code?
    Why the need for a Standard for Public Code?

The talk will show how the Foundation for Public Code is already applying the Standard to some codebases, and how this has helped those communities.

talking about collaboration over time                               and space                               first off my name is eric i am a                               developer have been doing so for                               a couple of decades now and presently                               i'm working with and collaborating with                                developers who are working on                                code bases in the open from multiple                                public organizations uh these code bases                                are under stewardship                                of the foundation for public code                                public code is free and open source                                software                                developed by public organizations or for                                public                                organizations to achieve                                a public policy or part of a public                                policy                                and increasingly                                we find that policy is being implemented                                in software                                and that our core infrastructure is                                sometimes                                at least having a software component if                                not being entirely                                software and as people talk about the                                so-called                                digital transformation of the public                                sector it's a                                thing i keep hearing people say we in                                fact                                see this unfolding all the time and all                                public infrastructure whether that's a                                bridge or whether it's software                                tends to have very high expectations and                                requirements                                that things outside the public sector                                don't necessarily have to have                                specifically around transparency but                                also reliability accountability                                but even things like sovereignty is one                                of the things that comes up                                and this is a lot to ask of a small                                public organization                                a municipality that is of a small                                village trying to                                make sure that their their citizenry                                can help participate in where the                                potholes are the street lights that are                                out                                uh probably don't have their own i.t                                staff and they don't have expertise                                in this and their needs though are the                                same as                                the needs of other municipalities some                                great some small                                and the way we are achieving this today                                to meet these expectations and fulfill                                these requirements                                is collaborating in the open across                                organizations and a key tool to that                                is the standard for public code all of                                the collaborators agree                                to fulfill the requirements and and                                uphold                                all the criteria in the standard and if                                you're a developer                                as you look through this you're not                                going to see anything that's very                                surprising to you                                it's almost certainly going to be things                                that you're either already doing                                or maybe you wish you were doing what's                                going to be different                                from maybe other agile handbooks                                or engineering guides is that there's                                guidance                                for not just individual contributors                                but also for management and even policy                                makers                                and what this means is that the devs the                                designers the people that are                                contributing to the project know that                                they have the support                                of people at many layers in the                                organization whether they are                                a contracted uh developer working for a                                vendor                                providing software services or whether                                they are                                a developer employed by the state                                and so as they're collaborating                                the public administrations are                                having the growing understanding that                                the software that they're working on                                is going to be evolving to fit their                                 needs over time                                 and they can collaborate on procuring                                 the next feature rather than                                 trying to understand all of what their                                 possible needs are up front                                 that they can work incrementally which                                 is a very different model                                 than the way they've done procurement in                                 the past                                 but because they're using the standard                                 because they're collaborating with                                 others using the standard they have                                 confidence                                 that these procurements are going to add                                 up to giving them                                 that increased control the reduction in                                 risks                                 and costs and they'll see their tax                                 spend                                 be more effective because the sum is                                 adding up                                 to something greater than the parts so                                 if you are at all connected to                                 any sort of software development in the                                 public sector or if you just have an                                 interest                                 i invite you to review the standard for                                 public code                                 and hopefully even participate it's                                 currently draft                                 and we are making this a public resource                                 as well                                 so there's the link to the                                 repository for it pull requests are                                 absolutely welcome                                 and you can also get in touch with me                                 directly
