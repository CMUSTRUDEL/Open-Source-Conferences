	                              this is just going to be a super quick                               introduction                               by me to sustain what is sustained                               um by the way chris it was great to see                               you just saying                               so sustain is an organization that's                               basically                               holding space for                               topics like conversations around what                                open source sustainability means what                                sustainability is um                                open source is a super huge field and                                there's a lot of issues with it                                right so millions trillions of dollars                                going through it and it's all run by                                people                                like me or volunteers or people sort of                                trying to figure out things unlike their                                side job or people who are paid maybe                                one hour a week to                                have a package uh everyone's seen this                                xkcd comic                                by randall monroe uh about the fact that                                the entire internet depends on some guy                                in nebraska                                i like how he said some guy in nebraska                                says nebraska is a bad place to be it                                isn't it's great                                but we all know the problem uh harpley                                was a good example of this problem                                um where everything was depending on                                these two people who worked in the                                basement in germany                                basically running open ssl and then it                                broke one day and they're like oh no the                                world's gonna fail                                um and this is a real problem right we                                have our dependencies are not well                                shored up                                uh and it's hard how do we                                solve who builds everything there's                                other things as well right so this is a                                maintainer dominic tarr                                very popular javascript guy and he                                created the package for fun uh left                                pad and then realized that you get                                nothing from maintaining a popular                                package once you write the code that all                                these people have these huge                                expectations                                and this is really really hard to deal                                with right it's really hard to be like                                ah i just made this thing and now people                                are demanding me to fix the thing that                                broke the internet                                uh kind of sucks uh other issues with                                open source                                uh maintainers burn out they don't wanna                                do it anymore there's a lack of                                diversity                                a lot of white cis fifth hit male dudes                                from america speaking as one a lot of                                corporate exploitation where people come                                in and take a lot of stuff and don't                                give back a lot of open source                                where people say oh yeah it's kind of                                open source but it isn't and there's                                license stuff that's kind of hard                                it's really hard to be governed in open                                source projects because most people who                                run open source are coders and may not                                know how to collaboratively build                                together                                it's really hard to integrate designers                                or                                marketers or advertisers or anyone who                                isn't a coder in open source                                and there's language barriers and                                there's ethical issues                                and then giving back is really really                                hard there's all sorts of stuff that's a                                problem                                so a few years ago there was a                                discussion about this on twitter                                and justin dorfman said you know it'd be                                cool to have an unconference to talk                                about it                                and then pm engineering from obamacare                                was like yeah let's do it then gregor                                martinez who is awesome was like yeah                                i'm in                                and so a few months later we had sustain                                this was the first                                conference talking about all these                                issues together and how do we solve them                                how do we make it better for maintainers                                for                                for funders for the whole community at                                large and then the next year we had it                                 again                                 so this was in london it was pretty                                 sweet we put a green filter on                                 everything for no reason                                 maybe that's just this photo and then we                                 had it again last year                                 in brussels this was right pre-pandemic                                 super fun to be able to go to belgium                                 and see all this great people all                                 talking about sustain                                 and then we had some more right so we                                 had uh some stuff in boulder we had a                                 thing                                 in lagos where we had developers                                 basically hold events                                 under the sustained branch and talk                                 about the whole issue                                 obviously we can't do that anymore                                 because cove is kind of really tough so                                 it's hard to have the sort of events                                 that we had so instead what we've been                                 doing this year is focusing a lot on our                                 working groups                                 where these are just ad hoc you know                                 sort of asephalus                                 if you want to talk about something with                                 someone else and it's related to sustain                                 we will hold space for you to do that                                 we'll run a zoom meeting                                 we'll get people interested we'll talk                                 about it so these are some of our                                 working groups and not all of them                                 um super super fun to see people working                                 on all these different issues together                                 we also now have podcasts where we talk                                 about sustain i just hosted it an hour                                 ago for the main sustained one                                 it's also impactful uh no sustainable                                 open source design                                 talking about design and sustain and how                                 do you get designers involved then                                 there's an ethics and open source                                 podcast we just                                 which is together with ethical source
