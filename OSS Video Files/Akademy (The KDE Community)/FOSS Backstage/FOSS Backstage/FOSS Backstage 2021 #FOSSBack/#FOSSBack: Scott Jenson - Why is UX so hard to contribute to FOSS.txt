Title: #FOSSBack: Scott Jenson - Why is UX so hard to contribute to FOSS
Publication date: 2021-03-04
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	As a UX designer, I've tried to contribute to three FOSS projects over the last year. The results haven't been encouraging. This isn't surprising actually, UX has historically been a 'nice to have' on many programming teams. This of course, has changed drastically on modern product teams but I suggest that FOSS is still a bit behind the times.

This talk isn't meant to throw stones but to discuss the tensions and pressures facing FOSS projects today. Some of these pressures hinder UX contributions. The goal of this talk is to list these pressures and discuss ways to help eliminate them.
