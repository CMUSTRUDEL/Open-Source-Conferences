Title: #FOSSBack: Scott Jenson - Why is UX so hard to contribute to FOSS
Publication date: 2021-03-04
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	As a UX designer, I've tried to contribute to three FOSS projects over the last year. The results haven't been encouraging. This isn't surprising actually, UX has historically been a 'nice to have' on many programming teams. This of course, has changed drastically on modern product teams but I suggest that FOSS is still a bit behind the times.

This talk isn't meant to throw stones but to discuss the tensions and pressures facing FOSS projects today. Some of these pressures hinder UX contributions. The goal of this talk is to list these pressures and discuss ways to help eliminate them.

	                              so thanks very much for having me this                               is a topic i feel really strongly about                               um first of all i want to make it clear                               that um i actually asked on twitter                               you know what's the right way to refer                               to open source projects                               and i got like eight different answers                               in such a rich community and so many                               ways referring to it so                                whether it's foss or floss or open                                source                                i'm just going to go with foss for now i                                just realized that there's                                there's many ways to refer to this                                community so um                                i want to start off with the elephant in                                the room and talk about the fact that                                why would you ever want to listen to me                                you know i work for the bad guys                                you know i work for proprietary software                                i worked at apple i worked at google                                but the issue here is i feel like i want                                to transcend                                just the economic models of what we're                                working on here i'm not here to talk                                about money                                or business process i just want to talk                                about ux                                you know and where that fits in this                                role and i'd like to think that those                                skill sets                                possibly transcend you know who you work                                for                                and besides you know there's to kind of                                 off of pablo uh picasso                                good artists borrow great artists steel                                so let's                                talk about what open source can steal                                from                                proprietary software and the goal here                                is to say                                talk about as much of ux that makes                                sense for open source projects the                                reason why i'm here though is that                                despite my past i have been trying very                                hard to be an open source                                software over the last couple years i                                volunteered on multiple projects                                and honestly it didn't go very well                                and it really kind of made me wonder                                like what's going on                                why is it so hard to contribute to                                overcast projects                                and so that's what this you know me                                struggling to help foss                                is about figuring out how we can make it                                better how can we grow as a community                                and so this talk                                is an exploration ux                                is often about having reuser research                                i was a user of research on this project                                you know doing a prototype                                this talk is a prototype and then doing                                a user test and this talk                                is your reaction will be you know the                                results of this user study so this is a                                prototype talk i'm just trying to see                                what works                                i'm absolutely positive that because i'm                                not well entrenched in the open source                                community                                i will probably put my foot in my mouth                                and say something incorrectly so please                                when i make a mistake uh please don't                                assume the worst                                assume that my heart is in the right                                place and if i do misstep                                uh correct me and let's work together                                and work on this so                                i'm trying to help here um the first                                assumption though                                is that um i'm talking about open source                                projects that need                                ux help um there's obviously a wide                                variety of open source projects and                                they not they don't all need ux help but                                things like libreoffice                                or or you know anything that has a                                very strong consumer-facing                                type of interface is the kind of project                                that we're talking about here um                                and like i said before this is meant to                                be a discussion i'm not here to bring                                you the tablets from the mountain to say                                you must do this                                it's more like let's let's see what we                                can do here to make these projects a                                little bit better                                the second assumption is that i'm not                                 going to name the names of the projects                                 i had so much trouble with i don't                                 believe in naming and shaming                                 i just want to uh use the examples                                 and see how we can kind of improve those                                 those specifics                                 so uh the my first try                                 um about a year and a half ago two years                                 ago roughly i                                 approached a uh open source project it                                 looked like it needed some help                                 and i was a bit frustrated that there                                 was no mention of ux there are no ux                                 tasks                                 there was literally nothing for me to do                                 i searched for the issues                                 and so my first point was there was just                                 no                                 hook i just didn't know what i could do                                 so being not wanting to give up i just                                 posted an issue you know just saying hey                                 i'm a ux designer                                 how can i help and i got a very                                 enthusiastic reply very quickly which is                                 like hey                                 so glad you're here we need icons                                 and when i tell i've told this story now                                 to a couple of uf designers and i always                                 get a                                 laugh from because apparently that's all                                 anyone ever wants on these projects is                                 just icons                                 it's about the universal ask for any ux                                 designer that approaches any project                                 and it's like really you know i mean i'm                                 happy to do icons                                 good icons are actually really hard                                 there's actually a subspecialty of                                 visual design that                                 really does a great job at this but it's                                 a lot of work but                                 my point is there's so many more things                                 that ux is about                                 icons is like the last on the list                                 and it's a little bit like if you were a                                 programmer for example just to                                 give you perspective what if the only                                 thing people talk to you about was unit                                 tests                                 i mean unit tests are important i mean                                 you need to do them but if that's the                                 only thing that you're asked is like                                 what there's so much more to talk about                                 and                                 that's the feeling i'm trying to convey                                 is that icons are fine                                 but can we broaden the scope of the                                 conversation a little bit                                 i'd like to use this idea of icons as my                                 organization tactic for the whole talk                                 because icons                                 represent i think the core issue about                                 ux and                                 foss and why it's not working that well                                 so i have three parts to this talk                                 can we expand the definition of what ux                                 is so there's a little bit more than                                 just icons                                 can we talk about the tools that foss                                 uses                                 that maybe prevents us talking more                                 about ux                                 and can we have a little talk about the                                 culture                                 and and how all three of these overlap                                 so                                 the only thing that's really possible                                 right now is icons                                 and the idea is i want to use this talk                                 to say can we give                                 things a nudge can we just push these a                                 little bit so these move a little bit                                 closer together so we have a                                 broader range of things that we can do                                 so on each of these topics i'm going to                                 have a summary slide                                 and the goal is to say you know let's                                 talk about what's happening today                                 and can we push things to be a little                                 bit better tomorrow                                 and because of my somewhat                                 newness to the foss community i may say                                 something's a little bit too                                 strong um i mean i can't kind of get                                 them right but let's talk about this                                 line between what we're doing today                                 review tomorrow so let's talk about what                                 ux is                                 if there's one word that summarizes the                                 goal of ux to me if there's one word i                                 want                                 non-ux people to understand it's                                 perspective                                 the whole goal of ux and all the tasks                                 that we do                                 is to give teams perspective what is                                 important                                 what should we be focusing on is you                                 know that what do what do users need                                 so we focus on these three basic things                                 users who are they how do we understand                                 them how do we describe them                                 what are their tasks not what are the                                 features                                 what are their tasks what are they                                 trying to do                                 and then of course when they actually                                 use your software                                 what is their pain those are the                                 fundamental                                 organizing motivating type things that                                 ux takes care of                                 and by doing these it gives us a lot of                                 vocabulary to discuss                                 now i have to quote the cathedral in the                                 bazaar and i realize it's a very old                                 document and i understand that many of                                 you have moved well past it                                 but it was kind of the document that                                 kind of established a lot of these                                 founding principles                                 and this is a quote that i took from it                                 treating your users as co-developers                                 is your least hassle route for rapid                                 code development and effective debugging                                 and honestly whenever a ux person reads                                 this                                 it's just we just want to cry you know                                 it is just such a                                 frustrating thing about how to                                 um about how                                 things work because the bottom line the                                 fundamental thing that has been kind of                                 seared into our souls                                 is that we aren't the typical users i                                 understand that having                                 developers be the users is the least                                 hassle way                                 but it's not the most effective route to                                 figure out what your users need                                 and so it's just this and i'm not saying                                 that you aren't your typical users i'm                                 saying                                 i'm not the typical user either and it's                                 kind of one of the                                 most critical things to understand about                                 ux                                 is that while open source community uses                                 this technique to get people to come in                                 we need to figure out ways of expanding                                 our way of thinking about that                                 and i use these four basic structures to                                 talk about what ux                                 is and how we talk about this                                 understanding bridging                                 flowing and refining and each of these                                 has tasks                                 that are meant to fill it in so                                 understanding means to understand the                                 users                                 user tests focus groups surveys                                 interviews personas they're all have                                 almost nothing to do                                 with the product and everything about                                 the users and what they're doing                                 the bridging is when you try to take                                 that understanding of users                                 and bridge it to the current technology                                 for example people that are doing                                 taxes might have a lot of paper tasks                                 organization tasks and so forth                                 as opposed to the actual tax tax                                 calculations themselves                                 the software may only worry about a tiny                                 piece of their overall tasks                                 and it's important to say well what can                                 the technology do what can't the                                 technology do what will be easy will be                                 hard                                 and that's a very moment of humility for                                 teams because you                                 you would admit that you're not actually                                 solving                                 all of their problems it's just the                                 piece that you can handle                                 then the flowing is about basically                                 stitching things together                                 how do users flow through your product                                 there's a lot of discussion in the                                 design community about ux versus ui                                 my definition is that ui is snapshots in                                 time                                 like each individual screen and ux is                                 about what connects the screens together                                 the time as you just flow through it                                 but this includes paper mock-ups ux                                 mock-ups motion studies and journey maps                                 and this is the overall journey that                                 your user is taking                                 through it and then of course there's                                 the final step which is the actual                                 building of the product                                 design systems color themes animations                                 copywriting style guides and yes                                 finally those damn icons so my point is                                 to say that there is a ton                                 of stuff that ux is doing and of course                                 icons at the very very bottom of the                                 list                                 and what we're trying to discuss here                                 today is how do we                                 fit these other tasks into open source                                 software                                 because all these things are trying                                 together is to create a shared                                 vocabulary                                 and so what i'm the summary point i                                 guess i want to leave you with here                                 is that there tends to be from what i've                                 seen uh                                 a belief amongst a lot of people in open                                 source                                 that i am the user the people that are                                 actually developing the product                                 and what ux is trying to do is to                                 discover the user                                 ux gathers the right information to                                 prototype and test                                 shared decisions and that's what i'd                                 like us to do more of                                 so moving on to my second point tools                                 there's the classic uh american phrase                                 which i believe translates to europe                                 quite well is you know give a man a                                 hammer and every                                 problem looks like a nail and of course                                 the hammer i'm referring to here is git                                 now a ton has been written about git um                                 i will admit i personally despise                                 get from the ux point of view but that's                                 not my point i don't want to criticize                                 git on the specifics                                 it's more about what git is trying to do                                 um all of those things i talked about                                 before understanding bridging flowing                                 and refining                                 are all effectively part of this                                 research loop of research                                 prototyping discussion and you generate                                 all sorts of things                                 uh flow diagrams sticky notes meeting                                 notes                                 uh you know so there's a huge social                                 construct                                 that kind of goes around this and yet                                 what is the primary tool of open source                                 it's get we are checking in files right                                 and it just                                 seems to just block out i mean git is                                 for                                 code there's no denying that it doesn't                                 capture the richness that tends to be                                 what ux is doing                                 so in a sense icons are very                                 understandable they are the closest                                 ux deliverable to code that we've got so                                 of course                                 teams want them i don't criticize teams                                 for wanting icons i get it                                 my point is that foss right now is only                                 asking for the work that                                 fits their workflow and my challenge is                                 to how do we expand the workflow a                                 little bit                                 now there's one more point i want to                                 make about tools because i made a second                                 attempt                                 with a different team about trying to do                                 something so i i                                 was able to convince the team that i was                                 working on to do a motion study                                 big win awesome i did the motion study                                 proposed it                                 checked it into an issue and the first                                 response i got was                                 oh if you're going to do this i'm going                                 to leave a project to not work on                                 anymore                                 and i was a little surprised by that and                                 i've told this story a few times and i                                 get a big laugh because apparently this                                 type of                                 drama is not uncommon in open source                                 and and i don't want to get into online                                 culture                                 and discuss that type of thing that's a                                 well beyond the scope of my talk                                 my point is more about the tools and how                                 they impact us                                 because git issues isn't the same as a                                 team                                 discussion so much of what we produce in                                 ux                                 requires discussion and team                                 understanding                                 and collaboration and all i'm saying is                                 that git issues                                 isn't always the best tool to do that                                 i hope that's not a controversial                                 statement i'm just pointing out maybe                                 the obvious point that we need to have a                                 better way for sometime coordinating                                 um the the newspeak was a term i love                                 using from                                      about a controlled language of                                 simplified grammar and restricted                                 vocabulary designed to limit the                                 individual's ability to think and                                 articulate concepts                                 and i feel like the in a sense                                 a text only chat room is a little bit                                 like newspeak it basically forces us                                 into this very narrow way of                                 communicating                                 and it limits nuance and social you know                                 how we can talk to each other                                 and so i'm just saying is i just want to                                 acknowledge the fact that even though                                 we're disparate teams across different                                 time zones and maybe                                 issues is the only way to talk it has a                                 cost                                 so my conclusion on this point is that                                 there's this tyranny of ascii                                 with open source it's all about text                                 files and text discussion                                 and i understand i get it i'm not                                 critical of it                                 well i mean maybe a little critical of                                 it but i'm saying how do we move beyond                                 that because                                 ux is about diagrams and discussion and                                 post-it notes                                 most companies have war rooms for ux we                                 put all of your stuff on the wall                                 with post-it notes and comments and                                 people flow through it's a vibrant                                 active social setting and by having                                 everything up on the walls                                 you can see it all now i realize that                                 online things                                 online programs don't necessarily do all                                 of that i'm just pointing out the                                 culture                                 and we have a culture in ux of war rooms                                 how do we get                                 a piece of that into open source my last                                 point is                                 foss culture and the issue here is again                                 cathedral and bizarre which is the                                 second point is                                 every good work of software starts by                                 scratching a developer's personal itch                                 and i get that and i think an awful lot                                 of projects are really small and you                                 need every maintainer you can                                 if they can come in to scratch it it's                                 good for them but it creates this kind                                 of bottom-up                                 thing that creates i think a little bit                                 of tension and it can create a little                                 bit of chaos                                 and so it because it tends to be this                                 culture of a bunch of individuals                                 working together                                 uh too often i think that a lot of                                 technical people assume that ux                                 designers just want to tell you no                                 and there's this assumption that we're                                 like these bad guys that just want to                                 shut you down                                 that's not what we're trying to do and                                 this comes from this top down                                 mentality that seems to be anathema to                                 the bottom up                                 of open source u.s designers don't want                                 to top down                                 to mean that what we're talking about is                                 more like ux is like a cfo                                 you know this is probably a bad analogy                                 for open source                                 maybe i should be using cfos an example                                 but the idea is that the ceo                                 knows finance well but he trusts the cfo                                 to do a lot of finance tasks for him                                 the cfo does data collection presents                                 information to the ceo                                 and then the ceo understands what the                                 cfo's doing                                 and he makes that decision ux is best                                 done                                 in this model where the ux is in                                 service to the project lead we do all                                 this data collection we present a lot of                                 choices but the product lead                                 actually makes the final decision but                                 the pres but the project lead has to                                 understand ux                                 that's the point i'm trying to make here                                 is that it works best if                                 both sides understand um how this works                                 because                                 what you get of course when you have                                 this type of situation                                 is and again probably to quote someone                                 that maybe doesn't have a lot of                                 traction in open source communities                                 steve jobs his quote which i think                                 resonates here is real artists ship                                 and what we mean and the critical part                                 of a real order ship                                 is that the fact you have to say no                                 and saying no i think is one of the                                 critical skills that open source needs                                 because you have such limited resources                                 you can't do everything but saying no                                 requires                                 perspective and that's what we're trying                                 to figure out how to do and ux is one                                 tool you have                                 to have that vocabulary to be able to                                 make the hard choices to take your                                 limited resources and get them out the                                 door                                 so no is only possible if the entire                                 team gets ux and that's part of my plea                                 here                                 i don't want to be the guy on the                                 outside checking in some random thing                                 for your team                                 to talk about and get issues and                                 misunderstand                                 this has to be a team effort and this                                 goes beyond                                 a pusher you know you know a pull                                 request                                 so in my final point here is to say                                 i want to get away from this potential                                 culture of my opinion versus our goals                                 when we move to a culture of our goals                                 all the decisions become a lot more                                 transparent                                 they become a lot more clear and                                 everybody can kind of support each other                                 and get more done that's my plea here so                                 here are the three                                 thing points in my talk and i want to                                 leave you with three possible things                                 that you can do                                 so for as far as what is you act and                                 again this is back in the                                 the the spirit of good artists borrowing                                 great art of steel                                 the first one is to to do a user study                                 you don't have to do it                                 put it in your issues put it on the in                                 your your your github                                 so that users know so that anybody who                                 comes like me                                 if you say we need to use our study that                                 will be a beacon that will draw people                                 to you                                 and i'm pretty sure you'll get people do                                 it for you now there's issues right now                                 with kovid but                                 i'm thinking more in the future the team                                 sport                                 i'm sure your project has a list of                                 things you need to get done                                 put ux priorities on that list it's a                                 critical part of your document that                                 should be shared with the team                                 and it'll force you guys to talk and                                 prioritize what three ux things you need                                 to get done this year                                 that's a great tool to also put on your                                 github to draw people in                                 and finally break out of list                                 discussions and discuss this over vc i                                 understand this could be hard for some                                 teams especially if you're in                                 large times and differences but break                                 out of that                                 have more social interaction meet                                 face-to-face or                                 zoom you know you know vc to vc so that                                 you can you can have                                 stronger bonding and more communication                                 outside of just raw ascii                                 i think each of these are small steps                                 that hopefully will nudge your team to                                 get more ux done                                 but keep in mind i'm i'm wrapping up my                                 last slide here i'm just here to start a                                 discussion my goal here is to kind of                                 give you guys                                 these suggestions about culture and how                                 we can move it and i                                 really want to

out                                 what our next steps we can do                                 so thank you very much i really want to                                 thank toby legal and

                       was really interesting actually and                                 um i hope as someone who describes                                 themselves as a                                 outsider you fail welcome here at                                 frostbackstage um today                                 um we have a question um                                 and i would encourage um anyone else who                                 has them please write them into the chat                                 or the question tab and i will ask scott                                 your questions                                 so the first one is um you mentioned                                 that ux culture                                 is also very much silicon valley culture                                 do you think uh there is a way to create                                 fast ux culture                                 what might that look like distributed                                 and                                 consensus-oriented decision-making                                 working in the open                                 volunteer driven etc                                 well i i hope that today is an example                                 of that culture                                 i am possibly naively coming in                                 and explaining what i want to have and                                 i expect that the people that have been                                 this for a long time                                 will say well i like that scott i don't                                 like that let me know what can we do                                 and so to me that is                                 this is the first step i hope of many                                 i'm also frankly hoping to find                                 like-minded people                                 there's obviously a group here called                                 open source design i'm anxious to talk                                 to them                                 and to see what's going on and to start                                 building up                                 best practices and then frankly showcase                                 successes sometimes we just need a                                 couple of design                                 studies to say oh look at here's a team                                 that did it let's celebrate them                                 so i'm hoping that we can have lots of                                 ways and in further conferences like                                 this                                 so for example i've taught i've gone to                                 a couple of                                 uh open source uh workshops or or                                 uh conferences and often ux is even                                 listed                                 so let's just let's let's just get                                 people to use the word ux a few times                                 and see where we go                                 yeah yeah definitely and that's yeah a                                 great plug for the um                                 ux workshop that's um taking place at                                 the moment actually so if anyone is                                 interested in that they can                                 head over to the workshop space um                                 that's the ux workshop being um held by                                 the open source design collective and                                 they                                 can help you with any questions about ux                                 that you have at the moment                                 um does anyone else have any questions                                 um yeah i'll give you a second to write                                 any down                                 um it made me think when you when you                                 were talking about the um                                 some of the things that you noticed                                 about uh the way that this design is                                 done                                 you were talking about the um the wall                                 room                                 you know in this design you know putting                                 up sticky notes and                                 and looking at things together and                                 working on that um                                 i think one of the things that is is                                 quite often uh                                 takes place in like the frost community                                 is that things are asynchronous                                 people are working in different time                                 zones in different places and so                                 it's it's quite difficult to um                                 foster that kind of uh yes this war room                                 idea i mean do you have any ideas for                                 how how people can do that well i think                                 step one                                 is to just appreciate that there are                                 things beyond you know                                 text type posts so for example i                                 mentioned i did a motion                                 study um just getting teams to                                 understand                                 that there are us deliverables outside                                 of icons and                                 um and you know just textual lists of                                 features                                 um so you know use the tools we have                                 so it's amazing how much an animated gif                                 has become the lingua franca for a lot                                 of ux discussion                                 so start by posting images and                                 animations                                 into issues because and and and and try                                 to get as much as you can within the                                 existing tool                                 um that being said um                                 let's start with the teams that can do                                 this in other words                                 um yes it may be hard but can we have a                                 few you know                                 vc kind of discussions across time zones                                 now if you're completely all over the                                 world i get it but not all teams are                                 going to be that way                                 uh the other one might be to say well                                 can we have some small teams you know                                 maybe it's better to take                                 two or three people put them on put them                                 together and they do their own mini worm                                 because two or three people as possible                                 and then post it up so that actually i                                 think                                 is the hardest question i raised today                                 because i'm glad you called it out                                 because there are no real good virtual                                 war room type software type things                                 you know what i will say is there are                                 whiteboard                                 there's whiteboard type software and                                 maybe we can talk about having virtual                                 whiteboards                                 to at least get all of our stuff up on a                                 single whiteboard                                 and then start to do comments so i'd                                 love to experiment with that                                 okay great um i have a few more                                 questions for you from the audience                                 um so um your talk about um                                 you talk about consensus uh where the ux                                 designer and the products lead                                 in open source world maintainers lead                                 where they both understand ux this is                                 hard it takes time                                 is there any suggestions                                 i completely agree it is hard and it                                 does take time                                 um just you know one of the things i                                 learned as a consultant is to say you                                 know                                 what's the cost if you don't do it and i                                 would argue that if you don't get                                 consensus it's even                                 harder so that's your alternative                                 so especially given                                 my brief experience with the way                                 conversations unfold                                 in some chat room in some issues                                 part of the reason why i actually                                 encourage vc conversations is that i                                 think it naturally makes                                 people a little bit more civil um so                                 there is that a discussion so                                 uh what i would start with though is um                                 you know community guidelines you know                                 how people work that's becoming much                                 more commonplace                                 um and a culture that really reinforces                                 it so when someone crosses that line                                 uh we call them out to say hey you know                                 that's not how we work here                                 you know um and and really                                 start the community guidelines come from                                 the top and so you have to make sure                                 that the maintainer and the organizers                                 are the ones that say guys you know                                 we're a group                                 we're doing this together you know                                 here's the ux documents that we have                                 that                                 establish what we're trying to                                 accomplish these are our priorities                                 and um but honestly let's let's be clear                                 i think i'm waving my hands a little bit                                 i think i just know what i want i'm not                                 exactly sure how to get it                                 and i expect frankly that there are                                 people much more accomplished in this                                 than i am                                 and i'd like to encourage them to come                                 into the conversation as well to say                                 let's really flag this as a high                                 priority and let's really work on it                                 because                                 i don't have all the answers on this                                 okay cool um                                 we have a time for another couple of                                 quick questions so                                 um someone asks um is this primarily                                 around applications versus desktop the                                 desktop has a different sociopolitical                                 scene than applications                                 that's interesting because i think of                                 applications as being                                 mobile or desktop                                 i'm not quite sure i see the dichotomy i                                 will                                 offers a counter that i would say it's                                 kind of more end user focused whether                                 it's                                 because because there's an awful lot of                                 tools that are developer focused that                                 are only for developers or                                 there's an awful lot of open source                                 projects that are like drivers well                                 i don't think there's no there's no                                 necessarily need for discussion at that                                 particular point                                 so um is there is there any                                 clarification to make sure i'm answering                                 the question properly                                 um no i haven't                                 um because i i would just say that as                                 long as there's an end user i don't care                                 whether it's desktop or mobile or web i                                 would i would i would put them all in                                 the same category from ux point of view                                 okay and uh one final question um let me                                 read this                                 um don't you think that ux is just                                 telling people what they should                                 do it just doesn't fit with sender patch                                 culture that was kind of my entire                                 point that ux isn't telling people what                                 to do                                 ux is about culture and teamwork and                                 vocabulary                                 and prioritization                                 you
