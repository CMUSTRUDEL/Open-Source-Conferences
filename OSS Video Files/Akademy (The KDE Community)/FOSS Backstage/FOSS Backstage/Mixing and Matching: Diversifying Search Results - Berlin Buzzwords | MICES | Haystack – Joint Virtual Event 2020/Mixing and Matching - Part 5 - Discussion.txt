Imagine a shopper searches for "coffee". The search results mindlessly repeat brand name, ground coffee over and over. Technically relevant. But not very useful. Not mixed in are results appealing to a different kind of "coffee" searcher:  organic coffee, whole bean, espresso, or related coffee equipment. 

Beyond relevant results is Result Set Diversity: providing not just technically correct answers, but a diverse (though still relevant) view of what's possible in the search system. Showing our grocery searcher that we might, after all, have something they want.

In this panel, we'll discuss Result Set Diversity in search. We'll hear from teams working to summarize for users the diverse array of options available to them given their query. An ideal search experience helps provide next steps, broaden the user's understanding of the content related to keywords, and cover the user's possible, unspoken intent.

Join host Doug Turnbull and search practitioners, Andreas Wagner, Felipe Besson, and Lev Gershenzon, as we hear experiences measuring & solving Results Diversity, with a panel discussion on the Result Search Diversity problem.

	                              so I know we have a lot of questions                               from the slide channel                               thought though as I went to gather those                               a bit more and sort of figure out how we                               might present them what I want to start                               with just one sort of topic which sticks                               out to me when I when I see your                               presentations is what after we talk                               about this topic of diversification what                                finally do we think relevance means and                                is relevant something that's at odds                                with diversification of search results                                is it the foundation for it                                should we completely throw out our DCG                                and NDC geometrics and just focus more                                on random search results like I'd be                                curious what you guys think and I'll                                live why don't you kick us off just sort                                of with your thoughts on that                                uh well thank you yeah well I I think                                that relevance is a technical term                                actually when when we see well I always                                try and recommend to see a user in front                                of you so nobody is interested in in                                having a lot of highlighted words in the                                title of the product they need something                                something else so if we can switch from                                talking about relevance to talking about                                the probability of this precise article                                to be useful word to be bought by this                                precise this precise user it can be more                                more fruitful and more useful of course                                relevance and the text relevance it's                                it's just a simple approximation to that                                so well in many in many cases the more                                words and the movers and the title we                                meet from the user query the the more                                the closer connection to what he meant                                there is but it's it's not it's not the                                primary source and what we get from the                                data from all the slopes may be much                                precious because well this users lakhs                                is just recorded journeys and recorded                                attempts of overcoming this                                unsatisfaction and these difficulties                                that users face during the navigation                                and searching and what we can do we can                                like shortcut we can try to analyze it                                to understand what they really wanted to                                find maybe even even in the cases where                                the users themselves don't don't know                                exactly what they want and to provide                                these shortcuts                                well it's speaking about the relation                                with the the diversification and its                                comparison to known standard metrics                                like and this is G hope you found we if                                we simply think that there is one                                dimension that we want to diversify we                                should take into account that each place                                marks and will to fill each place in                                search result page we should decide                                whether this need for intent was already                                filled and the user needs some                                additional product for a given intent or                                if it's time for him ahora to suggest                                something new and this can be calculated                                maybe a undressing to idiot and then a                                belated were proceed okay well I I have                                to I have to tell you one thing so                                before I really looked into this                                diversification topic I was always yeah                                convinced that with the data we have we                                can really model the behavior of the                                users we see out there and and and and                                and and we can serve what they want                                however especially for broad queries or                                inspirational queries when I looked into                                the data there was always this big gap                                between relevancy judgments                                even with click data and and then                                subject matter experts that said yeah                                but all of these are bikes yeah I know                                but I mean if I go into a shop or even                                if if you ask me you want to buy a bike                                the first question I asked you is yeah                                what kind of bike so what is the purpose                                of this bike and and and right now we we                                cannot really do this of course we have                                facets but still with the facets not not                                everything may be grouped together in a                                nice way and in Euro bike might be a                                hybrid of different things so I think we                                if we want to put this in a natural                                context then we need to have an                                exploration phase so we need to find out                                and and that's I think is the main goal                                of diversification it's not about                                directly optimizing the relevancy it's                                 about getting more information and                                 really try to understand and make it                                 happen that we can understand what the                                 users actually looking for maybe we're                                 always serving the wrong that the wrong                                 answer knows it's still it that it gets                                 it gets abort but maybe it could we                                 could have a                                                            rate who knows yeah my thoughts on that                                 are aligned if you guys like I also were                                 surprised like before start start I                                 started playing with like versification                                 was surprised how many times and maybe                                 tests that I have like clearly something                                 that's the wrestler read less relevant                                 write perform it better understand why                                 and then when I when I start with search                                 about this I it's clear like I said I                                 said user needs options like relevance                                 as the forehead the initial price like                                 it's nothing without intent or a lot of                                 context and there's the moment you start                                 to driven to go in this intent or                                 context you see that different users                                 have different needs so diversification                                 can help which is ko'd outlet also                                 another thing that opened my eyes like                                 in terms of like when you have relevance                                 the traditional relevance we look at the                                 addict we're okay and the local                                 similarities of the document                                 against that worry but diverse when you                                 start playing flavors you see that's                                 like actually used to help you look at                                 the data worse the similarity between                                 the documents no not only I guess the                                 query and that's the then when starts                                 understanding what do how you can like                                 change your research set should be more                                 successful yeah this is those are good                                 thoughts I think related to that I think                                 love you you called this out in your                                 slide deck is the idea that you see in                                 maybe reinforcement learning discussions                                 of exploit versus explore and I wonder I                                 wonder what you guys think like is there                                 a spectrum there of times we know okay                                 the the searcher wants a blue bike with                                 this size wheels and that kind of thing                                 and we are we feel confident in the sort                                 of the relevance and it's more a direct                                 ranking where other times where the the                                 query is rather broad and or ambiguous                                 and it's um there's an exploration and                                 if we're ever are really a hundred                                 percent on one dimension or the other if                                 it's somewhere in between well may begin                                 also oh because with this list of it                                 also I think it's it's a good analogy                                 it's a good case to to imagine that                                 you're in a brick-and-mortar store with                                 a good and attentive consultants in you                                 came to him or to her and say that you                                 want bluer mountain bike and then she                                 answers that doc look there are a couple                                 of blue mountain bikes but is blue color                                 is really that important because well I                                 have some mother mountain bikes that are                                 red or orange or black but they are more                                 I don't know cheaper and more efficient                                 they look fancier and so on and this                                 sort of behavior this sort of                                 interaction because well I                                 I want again stress that it's about                                 communication and this understanding is                                 important if we understand if you can                                 give this feedback that we got what you                                 wanted                                 we understood what you told us and we                                 don't know I understood what you told us                                 and asked us but we may suggest what you                                 really need and if we can distinguish                                 between that not just a considerable                                 behave with you as a as a damn person                                 and well I I'll show three times one                                 item that I want to when I want to sell                                 and please shut up and take it if it                                 will be it can be respectful and                                 understanding communication then there                                 is a broad well range of possibilities                                 and to use the details and if you if you                                 look at if you map these kind of                                 communities so the is inspirational                                 queries and broad queries on the on the                                 long tail graph what you directly see                                 normally is that we are in the short                                 heads so essentially this is the perfect                                 place to do machine learning because                                 you're not handling sparse data you                                 normally with every kind of experiment                                 you do you you can be quite sure that                                 you have enough samples and let's say I                                 haven't covered that in my talk but I                                 wouldn't just put these kind of row                                 based approach as let's say a fixed rule                                 you could do things like put a bandit in                                 front of it and say a try to play these                                 different approaches and and maybe the                                 Bandit comes even upward yeah these                                 don't work at all so put the initial                                 search result on top and these these                                 these recommended groupings at the                                 bottom you never know but now you have                                 you have a way of doing that imagine how                                 you would do this on a if you just have                                 one single result and a single dimension                                 to to sort on that I don't even know how                                 this might be possible without pinning                                 it manually on positions I I like this a                                 lot of having to like                                 like one you want on one side to have                                 this like exploit but legs won't be like                                 personalization let's see it's very                                 personalized it to know is that for the                                 use in this and then I have the other                                 extreme we can be like recommendations                                 of fresh ideas without the query open                                 query and I think these are the extremes                                 of diversity right and I think it's                                 information that's like you put like                                 maybe have AB entity to transition this                                 aspect array but like what my point is                                 that like we won't shoot the sweet spot                                 that you maybe you do don't don't do                                 that but you need some interactions to                                 to kind of feel those things or even                                 much you learn modest and I think also                                 in this case diversification also plays                                 I wrote this like I don't have                                 experience like this on search direct                                 but for example maybe diversify                                 recommendations can help but you few the                                 collaborative field remodel I have                                 recommender so can help you to kind of                                 at least tailor a little bit like some                                 fresh search basic fresh items                                 recommender so and then this is like you                                 feed those recommendations with                                 diversification so I think this is like                                 we we have to explore this spectrum and                                 I mean we we we already have coped the                                 topic of yeah how broad occur you might                                 be in in in terms of looking the                                 distributions on different metadata but                                 there is another thing you should have                                 in mind                                 I mean the pure result size sometimes                                 can be a good sign as well I mean if I                                 have thousands of t-shirts in the result                                 the chances chances might be good that                                 from these thousand t-shirts I'm selling                                 and I'm oh I only sell hundred and all                                 of the on the other nine hundred will                                 never be seen and this kind of                                 diversification helps you to give them a                                 spot at least a couple of times and                                 maybe it's the next best                                 a big thing yeah you you never know I                                 mean that's that's how retail is about                                 I'd be curious if you guys just to close                                 out this specific topic it sounds like                                 what you guys are saying is that I think                                 sometimes we can take a information                                 retrieval competition like a trek or a                                 cago competition and see that there is                                 clearly a set of ground truth corpus and                                 we optimize for some ground truth and                                 perhaps many of us got into this field                                 with that perspective would you say that                                 the maybe this is a leading question but                                 would you say that realities of a search                                 product a real search product are quite                                 more complicated maybe involve multiple                                 perspectives of optimization that are                                 around along multiple dimensions yeah we                                 definitely tend to oversimplify things                                 when we model stuff so to model the                                 reality is it's really hard and it will                                 maybe take                                                             until we are really able to understand                                 how people shop things online and how we                                 can get the maximum out of it but at                                 least from my point of view without                                 exploration I think we will be locked                                 soon because then all the top sellers                                 will almost be the same on every                                 marketplace so you will have to buy all                                 the traffic to get on your site because                                 you are the cheapest and that's not a                                 good place to be and you need to                                 diversify your business as well so yeah                                 you need to find ways to to spot the                                 differences in for a query or for a                                 category page for different audiences                                 and meanings I'm under person sure yeah                                 I think this is the secret for having a                                 health ecosystem and for marketplaces in                                 general because like as if you don't                                 have ever like sellers that you don't                                 guarantee like them and like search                                 clicks for those                                 was a point of the serozha marketplace                                 is bad for the seller bad for the                                 marketplace and potentially bad for the                                 user as well so I think the key of like                                 this diversification special landing                                 page I think is very important to                                 promote new sellers or not necessarily                                 new sellers but new stuff something                                 that's not like purely defined by                                 algorithms                                 maybe seasonal stuff like breaking the                                 cycle of be only Tristan Ramos angry                                 well I I would all only add that it's                                 like with this diversity problem it's                                 like before we just left with text                                 relevance and it was a key and then we                                 started to use some behavior signals and                                 edit some information and so now we are                                 talking then it was about                                 personalization so we realized that it's                                 worth showing for the same query for                                 different users if we know something                                 about them some different results and                                 now we're just trying not what not only                                 we're to add some information about this                                 intent or these dimensions of that                                 should be diversified and there is no                                 conflict with the relevance because well                                 you can simply think that this old                                 relevance it remains but we add this new                                 dimension so we can we can judge the                                 results by relevance but for the query                                 and for one choosen intent and then                                 there is another task maybe a bit more                                 complicated how to fill in all the                                 places on the search result page because                                 well we not only take into consideration                                 the relevance in the condition that this                                 precise intent was made but also this                                 probability of this intent being being                                 men so well of course it's all it's all                                 about proximation and simplification but                                 we we are gay                                 in deeper and deeper and it's getting                                 more complicated and it's it's final                                 maybe there is a blender right like it's                                 like as you define in andreas like you                                 maybe don't want you like to be in the                                 power of larger models or the ranking                                 algorithms what is a layer of a ring                                 that we don't want to like mess up with                                 face it it's just a plaintiff like is                                 something that's come of recommendation                                 it dispenses the second layer or rank                                 that you needed top of search results                                 yeah I mean the only thing I potentially                                 would like to add is I think that we                                 modeled relevance in the typical way                                 called the quantitive measurement just                                 in on a single dimension and essentially                                 it all of these results might be                                 relevant for us and maybe for others as                                 well but what what is really important                                 is real relevance in context so for this                                 particular loser user at that particular                                 time coming from maybe this site                                 relevance might be something different                                 then judge judges that just judge ten                                 thousands of products or or without this                                 I think that's the thing you just cannot                                 generalize it it you're saying yes                                 there's one question from Matteo Catina                                 hopefully I'm getting that name right                                 how do you represent relevance judgments                                 for diversification or what you guys                                 think yeah I mean there you can still                                 use the same stuff as before so I mean                                 how we are currently I mean cough it                                 took us the chance to to already present                                 some numbers because we initially plan                                 to have this life together with the                                 customer so I don't have it yet but at                                 least I can tell you how the way how we                                 approach it right now and want to do it                                 so we would still have relevancy                                 judgments and and these judgments would                                 apply on the initial result set but on                                 top of that if we see that let's say the                                 actual usage of the products that                                 show them is it's not on a sweet spot                                 let's say always on the top so it's it's                                 everywhere around the result even after                                 refining the result then this is a clear                                 signal for us that we might want to                                 diversify it and there you can just use                                 your typical user signals as well like                                 click-through rates add two cards byes                                 and all these things and and and what                                 you essentially do is you have a second                                 layer ranking that just tries to                                 optimize a ranked set for this                                 particular context                                 this is how I see it I don't know if                                 it's if it plays out well but it's the                                 only way I can imagine how to solve the                                 issues I see with the data I mean it's                                 it's obvious in this field of like a I                                 don't know table dancer but one thing                                 that come to my mind is that I can't see                                 maybe with human manual judgments like                                 what if like for a query we try to                                 collect the documents for our persona or                                 assuming an intent of course need a lot                                 of knowledge domain knowledge for this                                 but that's assuming that you can like                                 collect the interpretation of I I can                                 always phone for different things and                                 then you have different judgment lists                                 right you run like you optimize for each                                 of this query plus intent so and this is                                 no extra dimension that put your query                                 right and then you have the best ranking                                 for each query pleasant things the                                 questions now is the plant you have your                                 final result set and you can blend all                                 this you can interleave basically all                                 these three judgments and then you are                                 your model has to maximize the the ends                                 each year I don't know any other metric                                 of it isn't I'll leave it final result                                 sets because if they assume that you                                 have to put everything the same scale                                 and then you are going to have a result                                 sets I agree that like maybe your model                                 pick like the first intent for the first                                 query but then you can like try to                                 measure second metrics that we discussed                                 here like to make it special this would                                 how much in danger                                 rain snow with an idea like yes go ahead                                 maybe another read some some some                                 questions about the user interface and I                                 think it's it's also a very challenging                                 task to somehow mix will merge this                                 designer you you it's use tasks with our                                 optimization test because well if we                                 talk when we talk about metrics in this                                 is a for example or he found they are                                 popular because they somehow quite good                                 approximate the users behavior there is                                 a model that users for example they scan                                 the results from top to bottom and when                                 we talk about diversification and                                 different intents and even if we can                                 have these judgments for each pair of                                 incent and document we need to resolve a                                 bit the different tasks we need to                                 calculate what's the probability that                                 all the previously shown results weren't                                 sufficient but the intent was right were                                 a new intent beneath and when we need or                                 try different ways of presenting the                                 results different ways of grouping what                                 unreal showed us or clustering or maybe                                 some different size that products can                                 occupy on this products out page then                                 maybe this models will change and it's                                 well I have no idea told how to measure                                 this but it's it would be great if we                                 could combine some interface decisions                                 with some optimization and somehow judge                                 and assesses what what gets what we get                                 in the results yeah thanks                                 one more question from Rene that I think                                 is interesting is and I'll try to                                 summarize suppressive is                                 I think it's a lot of approaches that                                 I've seen her diversity and I think some                                 of the things you guys have presented                                 rely on the distribution of say                                 categories and the index or how the                                 index is represented we've also talked a                                 little bit about how diversification                                 really is trying to get at multiple                                 possible senses of the users intent and                                 I wonder if maybe there's a mismatch                                 there and if there's anything we can do                                 about that like maybe we should be                                 reaching and tracking for what the users                                 intents are and asking sort of asking                                 the question are we correctly capturing                                 the probability of their intention given                                 what we know about keyword and the user                                 I just                                 quite quite shortly one-one decide                                 because well maybe I I expressed my idea                                 Rowen I I saw Renee's question from my                                 point of view the amount of items                                 allocated one design one category in the                                 database in the product base has nothing                                 to do with calculating the intents of                                 the users so when they don't match it's                                 a signal that something is wrong in this                                 database                                 we can't force the user just by some                                 some source of goods just because we                                 have a lot of them in destroy available                                 and when one - so it's just when we talk                                 about these distributions distributions                                 these are distributions on the set of                                 products that users already interacted                                 with and yeah maybe maybe a hundred                                 percent of this category and maybe one                                 percent can be different yeah my fault                                 on that had maybe - it is like when I                                 for example let's assume for the first                                 edges that you have is - a criteria -                                 kind of                                 the government's not necessary category                                 but agree that if you do it like I did                                 for that completes is only the perspect                                 of the diamond but what it can offer                                 actually to the user like what if like                                 we can derive this the similar                                 distribution for the clique distribution                                 and you believe that you will see that                                 what users search more for less you can                                 maybe distributed the writings too                                 follows into this category you have a                                 higher probably that's the higher                                 cricket category and then you assigned                                 today another one another thing that is                                 like from the surgeon wallet is like                                 from web search they try to do that with                                 a bunch of algorithms there was one                                 special algorithm that I had the chance                                 working casual guide with Ashraf and we                                 basically is called MMR with marginal                                 maximum marginal relevance                                 you'll have your irrelevance and you                                 find the seconds for that measure how                                 different you are from where you pick it                                 right and there one of the iterations                                 that we did the first one yeah we lie on                                 the Kotak categories but the second one                                 we'll use it more like this which like                                 there wasn't like mudflow dimensions                                 right so basically you have a seat yet                                 and then you cut the second one the most                                 relevant one and then you measure how                                 similar this item this is from the first                                 one using more like this which like a                                 multi-mission like a similarity metric                                 so it worked for it was interesting and                                 you measure the coverage later and we                                 had the real diversity results doing                                 that oh yeah I I mean I                                 we've never went a life with something                                 we didn't had a customer that does                                 something like that                                 I was just spotting gaps in the data and                                 there was no clear explanation for that                                 and the idea of let's say row based                                 groupings and rankings essentially came                                 to my mind when I saw how Netflix and                                 and other streaming                                 people are doing that because they're                                 you                                 a lot of different intents and you have                                 limited space on the screen and there                                 you really need to diversify and and                                 diversify in a lot of different areas so                                 it can be the the Java it can be by by                                 maybe interesting actors because I'm                                 always looking the the same actors and                                 and I mean they prove that these systems                                 are superior to let's say normal                                 relevance based algorithms but we have                                 to prove that for for e-commerce I would                                 say I mean I know that Amazon is already                                 doing it for some pages I don't know how                                 they do it but I know that they are                                 doing it yeah let's let's try it I mean                                 now we have the tools to do it and let's                                 try it and see if it's a success or not                                 yeah that's awesome one I think Tito                                 made a series of really interesting                                 points just now in the in the in the                                 slack where he mentions sort of user                                 specific goals in the context of a query                                 and you have subdomains I mean we're all                                 or primarily focused on e-commerce now                                 but there are some domains sometimes                                 even within e-commerce where it's there                                 so there are some domains where it's the                                 focus is really like serendipity and                                 sometimes giving users things they                                 didn't know they expected and there are                                 other domains where the problem is much                                 more about sort of a notion of                                 comprehensiveness relative to the query                                 yeah I'd be curious to what extent for                                 example research might be a domain like                                 that and maybe also the commerce I'd be                                 curious to what extent diversity                                 strategies need to change to handle                                 different maybe ultimate goals that                                 diversity might might serve or if                                 there's maybe even some problems with                                 the university                                 yeah definitely I mean one that was                                 already been pointed out is the the time                                 dimension so a word can have a                                 completely different context when time                                 goes by I saw this a couple of times in                                 the data as well where when when ice age                                 came out I see four it was always clear                                 what you have to serve and then people                                 were just searching for eyes and and                                 nobody was really clicking on ice                                 anymore they all wanted to see ice ages                                 on top                                 I mean without exploration or I mean the                                 kind of using user feedback so when they                                 reformulate stuff they don't find what                                 they're they were looking for and then                                 do something so when you capture the                                 whole session that's nothing else in my                                 opinion that exploration but it's the                                 hard way because how many percent of                                 your users will will be gentle enough to                                 do these kind of things a lot of them                                 will just bounce off and and you will                                 potentially never see them so I think                                 there's a lot to cover a lot ground to                                 cover and even Google doesn't do a                                 perfect there yet always space for for                                 improvements and new opportunities yeah                                 well I just wanted to add that even here                                 in our session if we try to answer would                                 discuss some questions about variation                                 we always limit this diversity to one                                 dimension because well it's already                                 something new and what Andy said is                                 important that not just we have multiple                                 dimensions to diversify but we                                 understand that all these distributions                                 of parameters their values even if we                                 calculate them not on the product base                                 but on the products that users                                 interacted with their conditional so                                 well maybe just like with the color if                                 you are looking for a blue mountain bike                                 maybe blue won't be that important for                                 you and even if we look at all the bikes                                 that                                 but after someone looked for blue bikes                                 maybe we can understand whether this                                 particular parameter this particular                                 value that you were explicitly asked for                                 is that important or not and with brands                                 yeah and so well it can be really                                 complicated yeah yeah I think that's the                                 tricky part is work because if you go                                 like web search research there was this                                 MMR decimation bunch of other algorithms                                 but they assumed that like the process                                 of course of reading a document is                                 easier than like but something and then                                 when you run through choose between on                                 document to another is like and if it's                                 maybe you have more information so is                                 this you know that something is                                 different and we're going to skip it and                                 then they they optimize is for avoid                                 every Dulles when when you talk about                                 like e-commerce for example we need some                                 redundant strip and per so I think that                                 that's the trickiest part but I believe                                 in the both case like web search and                                 then you can consider like a diverse as                                 investment like sometimes you have some                                 vests like you sacrifice sure maybe like                                 don't put your all your bags or rags the                                 same basket like you for I could try to                                 verse fight to minimize the loss because                                 if you have multiple repetitions if you                                 have like different baskets you put your                                 X you maximize your chance just                                 successful and then maybe it came back                                 to that spectrum as the moment you find                                 out that you maybe can exploit and solve                                 this problem yeah thanks I think it's                                 really interesting that you know when I                                 think about this problem it seems to be                                 almost this this when we encounter a                                 keyword almost this first question we                                 can't we can't assume we have more than                                 a keyword for example in search or when                                 we do have more than the keyword we have                                 to be really gentle with how we use it                                 and it almost feels like in                                 search and this has been true just                                 focused purely on a relevance problem we                                 have to look at a keyword and think you                                 know what is the what is the intention                                 behind this query and I think                                 historically we've we've maybe thought                                 of that as one intention like I will                                 steer you in this one direction because                                 I think you want a mountain bike that is                                 blue and I will give you everything in                                 that category and I will rank somehow                                 but it feels like and I'd be curious                                 what you guys think this this topic of                                 diversity is also about this maybe that                                 first block when you encounter the                                 keywords of of intention but really                                 instead of a single answer we get a                                 probability distribution back and then                                 with depending on each little maybe each                                 each of those intentions however we                                 model that which is very domain-specific                                 and challenging we almost have in there                                 a relevance problem so it's it's almost                                 like relevance is the thing happening                                 within each attention and                                 diversification is the thing that that                                 that probability distribution will we                                 have to somehow grasp at all the                                 possible intentions yeah that's                                 definitely the case there are a lot of a                                 lot of examples for that like I have                                 this this this this cool example my                                 opinion in the fashion industry so we we                                 saw quite some traffic on red Valentino                                 dress and we we saw like how the KPIs                                 where we're moving and it wasn't                                 particularly well and then I explored                                 that yeah it is ambiguous because the                                 user might might search for a red dress                                 from Valentino but there is also a                                 subgrant                                 of manettino which is called red                                 Valentino and and so it's that this red                                 doesn't really need to be a color it                                 could also be related to a label and I                                 shouldn't just pre-filter or make a                                 judgment out of it if the if the                                 distribution is not clear for us so give                                 the user both results or or make make                                 clear that we are not sure that we group                                 there is                                 in both or in two sections and then by                                 by clicking you can easily do what he                                 wants and and get what he wants I should                                 say we're about out of time so I think                                 this is a good final thought if Lev and                                 Philippe if you want to on this sort of                                 this notion if you guys have any final                                 thoughts on diversity or diversity                                 related to this distribution tense I                                 have one final thought like yeah I think                                 it it with a magician like you have                                 multiple combinations that you can drive                                 and just looked like she finishes like                                 may be related to this can also bring                                 hardscapes like there was this paper                                 that Hindi Sheree first like when I                                 started about Spotify and then how he's                                 trying to diversify and it's very                                 interesting because for then it was                                 almost like that like they're the kind                                 of have a nice paper Austin paper chose                                 like yours that the yours that has more                                 diverse the core generalist music tasty                                 they have a better retention and and                                 they thing a bit like it user and their                                 taste as like I the factory space and                                 that smooth put that that's not like                                 this because when you are user as a                                 specialist is concentrate and then ever                                 finish their very own way one way to all                                 kind of like recommenced before them and                                 their algorithms look it's very good                                 much better for the generalists but                                 really compare over time over time                                 afternoon year two years I think they                                 went through back past two years it was                                 a who had a more general taste like the                                 the vectors are more different like this                                 song song vectors and the distaste user                                 taste vector they have a better                                 reputation so I think it's this kind of                                 investment stuff that I think is it pays                                 investment like for long term like at                                 least for Spotify diversify the                                 diversified results like we make the                                 users use more attachment I just wanted                                 to add that from my perspective it's                                 nothing you we have the same old tasks                                 we need to increase conversion rate and                                 sales                                 diversification can help but yeah we go                                 deeper and we model may be different the                                 users behavior and speaking about                                 metrics if we come to next level if we                                 can track the conversion rate in terms                                 of users if we understand that there are                                 super sessions like nd already mentioned                                 that some types of products you can                                 choose for weeks and maybe months and                                 when you can add the information about                                 the experience with the product whether                                 the user was satisfied or not so well a                                 huge amount of data but this model in                                 makes sense if we manage to do it the                                 results in our interaction in our                                 communication with the users will be                                 better yeah thank you this has been a                                 real interesting panel I really                                 appreciate Felipe Andreas and live                                 thanks so much for for your talks in
