Title: #FOSSBack 17: Bertrand Delacretaz: Asynchronous Decision Making â€“ why and how?
Publication date: 2017-11-29
Playlist: FOSS Backstage Micro-Summit 2017
Description: 
	The Asynchronous Decision Making techniques commonly used in open source projects enable efficient remote collaboration, in teams which have no boss, no schedule and often no cultural consistency yet produce world-changing software. These very efficient collaboration techniques can even work without computers and apply to most types of projects, not just software development. This talk describes the key elements and tools of the Asynchronous Decision Making process, based on concrete examples from the Apache Software Foundation and from federated governments, which, interestingly, work in a similar way.

	00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,220
so my talks about the secret

00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,750
decision-making

00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:15,320
I have not invented anything it's

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:19,789
something that we'll be doing for ages

00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:22,740
just been reflecting on on what it is

00:00:19,789 --> 00:00:24,720
you know I think our produce many of our

00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,330
open source projects are extremely

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,009
efficient we don't have any meetings

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,560
we're working with people from different

00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:34,680
cultures different time zones different

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:38,690
companies there is no boss and it works

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:40,620
we you know many of our projects deliver

00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:43,620
world-changing software I would stay

00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,680
open is here from the a loop crowd I

00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:55,710
think we can rightly say that Hadouken

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:58,340
industry but my name is before I wrap it

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:02,460
up bonus points for pronouncing it right

00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:04,530
I work with Adobe in Basel we have an

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,920
Adobe Applied Research Center I have a

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:11,670
principal scientist meaning that state

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,650
guide and also on the very active in the

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,770
Apache Software Foundation since the

00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,630
early 2000 on the both directors forum

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,270
the ninth

00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:24,510
so most on the technical side and also

00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,310
on the Border's general management of

00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:28,860
the foundations and I've been reflecting

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,560
a lot on these topics

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:35,119
how do those projects are efficient how

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:38,850
can we replicate that

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,679
business or other organizations of

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,509
course we can make fast decisions but we

00:01:40,679 --> 00:01:47,640
have many factors to take into account

00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:50,549
so I think in our projects we do lots of

00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,640
decisions if you look back how you shape

00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:55,259
software how you agree agree in Apache

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,929
projects can be sometimes a bit

00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:01,079
difficult so it'sit's all relates to

00:01:57,929 --> 00:02:07,829
making decisions getting consensus on

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:12,900
the decisions that we make at the at

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:15,030
Apache con Sevilla 2016 and this dog

00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,980
called I will not attend your meeting of

00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,959
noble sauce person it's a bit more

00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:21,569
provocative it's kind of the same topic

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,060
you know how can work without having

00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:26,640
meetings this was done more from the

00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:29,099
provocative angle but it's the same the

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:34,290
same thing we don't have big sponsors or

00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:36,450
very rarely just talking with Chris in

00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:39,480
Apache call the Apache conference I

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:42,450
think all of us what would refer is the

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,250
envoys conference it's just chatting

00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,739
these people in the hallways or at the

00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:49,500
bar or in the garden somewhere the talks

00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:53,819
are good but but it's things very often

00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:57,150
happen in the evening over this is

00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:59,130
another I wrote this blog post for we

00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,900
have series of blog posts called success

00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,790
at Apache on the Apache Software

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,430
Foundation blog which traffic is pretty

00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:06,930
good and I wrote one of these posts on a

00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:10,709
sequence decision-making so it's the

00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:17,040
same thing as I'm telling you today with

00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:23,040
I'm booking to another one soon so this

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:25,650
is the this is a gift of remote teams

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,810
but especially remote software teams

00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,239
need to make lots of decisions all the

00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:33,120
time we are making decisions which have

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,400
in fact the project to me to reel them

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,560
we need to make the right decision and

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,849
when we have options we need to agree on

00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,709
which option I would say that the Apache

00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:49,620
model works best for infrastructure

00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:53,599
software that doesn't have buttons if

00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,599
you have trying to agree on the color

00:03:56,299 --> 00:04:01,500
it's easier to agree on stuff that's it

00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:04,140
a structure because you have if you have

00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,980
a web server it's pretty obvious what it

00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,410
needs to do

00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,750
you might debate how do we do that that

00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:12,750
what it needs to be to serve web pages

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:15,359
very efficiently yet if you look at the

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,340
Apache web server the SBPD project it's

00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:20,970
extremely modular it's a pretty small

00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:22,830
core and everything else is modules my

00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:26,190
theory is that that's because people

00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:28,620
could not agree and and really

00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,660
modularity is a way to solve community

00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,440
problems if you cannot agree on

00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,289
something

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,910
do modules and what you know maybe

00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:39,910
someone will use what money maybe

00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:42,400
you'll be both are happy and still

00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:44,560
sharing the very important call which is

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,780
which is a key so I think one of the key

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,120
of success in these projects is reducing

00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,610
the surface on which we are to agree and

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,860
that's what microphones are so we have

00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:57,250
to be able is very equal to for the rest

00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:59,680
it's not as important so the question is

00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:02,380
how can that happen without meetings and

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,350
how can we keep the process efficient

00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:07,480
and fun I think the fun factor is

00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,700
extremely important and as well as in

00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:11,380
business in companies if you if your

00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,780
colleagues you are employees about

00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:15,790
having fun when they have an opportunity

00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,950
to leave there will need or you have to

00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:20,440
pour lots of money on them which is

00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:24,760
expensive so you know I think the fun is

00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:27,610
important then we can keep this part but

00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,890
by being active on both sides both the

00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:32,020
tech side and the administrative side of

00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:34,810
the Apache Software Foundation sometimes

00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,580
it's hard to keep the fun when you when

00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:38,290
you disagree about something important

00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,660
it's all that we you should strive for

00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:42,610
doing that we have a nice concept that

00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,770
we mentioned sometimes alone is the

00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:50,470
share neurons putting up neurons

00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:55,470
together to do something great and so

00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:55,470
what is a simple decision making that's

00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:01,980
I haven't done I'm not the psychologist

00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:08,190
haven't done very complicated studies

00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:08,190
from at least so maybe some degree and

00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:15,820
this is how I see decisions there are

00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:16,660
four main phases first you need to

00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:20,950
brainstorm

00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:25,690
yeah you know need to have white dreams

00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:27,010
or wild ideas or could we do this thing

00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:35,110
you don't want to have any any

00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:37,450
constraints then you will we find these

00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:40,720
disparate slopes into actual options

00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:43,360
what are the options at this point we

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,150
have to do a specific function in our

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,669
software we do it this way or did we use

00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:51,130
maybe other software or we could do this

00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:54,820
the other way and at this stage you

00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:57,400
should try to keep you my donor so not

00:06:54,820 --> 00:07:00,060
you know try not to be too biased say

00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:02,200
okay what are the options maybe and

00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:04,000
sometimes that happens when you're more

00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:07,960
experienced enough others may be you

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,270
know that option sees that we're going

00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,789
to take option C we still include it for

00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:16,060
fairness with your colleagues to for you

00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:19,360
know so they feel that something say and

00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:24,970
even if you pretty sure later in the

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:27,010
consensus you would come up then you

00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:29,560
need to be in the consensus that's the

00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:32,350
third stage that's the one that is often

00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,900
the hardest because you know what are

00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:37,450
you doing the options there's no there's

00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,780
not much at stake you someone said oh I

00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:43,300
want to have these options okay yeah we

00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:45,820
decide but once you have to do the

00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:49,900
consensus that's when things can get

00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:52,810
heated and we have mechanisms

00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:54,760
and then the decision once you have the

00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:57,330
consensus the decision is just

00:07:54,760 --> 00:08:01,180
formalizing it so having a way to

00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:03,790
document the decision so that next week

00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:06,220
still valid or when someone usuals your

00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:08,950
team even on that to that CEO this is

00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:11,290
the decision that we made last month you

00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:14,370
have the explanation and so so that I

00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:16,570
think we really where it where it's

00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:20,740
where there's work to do is that the

00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:24,310
consensus rather something interesting

00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:28,020
to note is that unless you have forward

00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:30,730
reason to do to have people do that

00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:33,330
none of this requires people to be in

00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:36,010
the same place at the same time you know

00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:39,070
consider a phone meeting the same place

00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:40,930
now none of this needs to be synchronous

00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:43,990
everything can happen at synchronously

00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:46,330
if you have the right tools and that

00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:50,110
that's that's what I'm what I'm trying

00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:54,880
to do today in some cases like the like

00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:57,820
the Apache board meeting the Apache

00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,250
bylaws require us to make decisions in a

00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:02,950
certain way that requires us to be on

00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:06,220
the phone to have a vote on the phone or

00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:08,380
maybe you maybe try to you know then

00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,450
that debate that is required and also

00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,460
speak a bit about the Swiss government

00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:13,680
which in

00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,540
city workers in a similar way and they

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,760
also have written requirements to be a

00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,190
laborer or made a decision but in most

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,860
cases if itself if you creating soft

00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:26,330
software nothing requires you formally

00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:31,950
to be to be exactly so it can maybe

00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:35,220
signals the tools the radio and a drawer

00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:38,940
or output I'm trying to get out

00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:42,209
not-not-not talk too much about software

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:44,310
tools because they can be sometimes it

00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:46,500
people can be very often generated about

00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:49,010
which tool you want to use and I want to

00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:52,290
avoid this austerity at a higher level

00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:55,110
so for me the two main tools that we

00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:57,149
need to do that is a shared a

00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:00,089
synchronous communications channel a

00:09:57,149 --> 00:10:02,670
channel where everybody uses the same

00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:04,980
channel to speak you talk to the project

00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:08,399
instead of talking to specific people

00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:11,160
and you have a way to share the channel

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:14,250
and to branch out into more specific

00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,910
discussions at Apache we do that by

00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:19,560
default with mailing lists which are

00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:26,250
often considered as a node of the county

00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:28,830
- today the young folks the thing is

00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,690
that amazingness is very if it's used

00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:32,459
with lots of discipline that's another

00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:34,500
question but if you have the right

00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:36,660
disappear on mailing list it you can

00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:40,020
reach the people very efficiently and

00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:42,060
you can have threads which I can totally

00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:44,430
ignore if I'm not interested in this

00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,459
specific discussion so it's easy to pay

00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:48,850
attention to

00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:50,139
to completely ignore the rest and I am

00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:53,319
used to you know I've been doing that

00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:56,139
for ten years now I can't follow many

00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:58,449
discs which are 300 messages a day I'm

00:10:56,139 --> 00:11:01,449
not reading the 300 messages I may be

00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:03,309
reading in twenty ten of them and the

00:11:01,449 --> 00:11:05,139
rest are skipped because of the because

00:11:03,309 --> 00:11:08,290
of the subject line because of the

00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:10,899
shredding so if you use it what it's the

00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:14,519
same thing as if you do marine radio and

00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:16,689
I have my sailing instructor in the room

00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:18,699
immanuel immanuel ishani

00:11:16,689 --> 00:11:20,709
on top of being a volunteer Apache is a

00:11:18,699 --> 00:11:24,029
volunteer at late at night France which

00:11:20,709 --> 00:11:24,029
is the best sailing school in France

00:11:24,939 --> 00:11:31,149
what'd you do what'd you sailing on what

00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:33,579
or when you when you you know driving a

00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:36,429
ship you have a radio which has one

00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:36,910
common challenge at sixteen is broadcast

00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:41,889
channel

00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:43,480
that's way cool for parabolic and then

00:11:41,889 --> 00:11:45,579
we'll switch to a different channel to

00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,230
for the rest of the conversation it's

00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:49,600
exactly the same as to do on make with

00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:51,699
you call for people on radius with a

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,889
good subject line but then whoever wants

00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:55,899
to jump in the discussion can do that by

00:11:53,889 --> 00:11:57,339
staying the same track all otherwise

00:11:55,899 --> 00:12:00,939
we'll just be called complete discussion

00:11:57,339 --> 00:12:02,889
based so this is the synchronous

00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:05,019
communication channels and the other

00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:09,429
thing that you need is a case traveling

00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:12,009
to an Apache we often use JIRA or

00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:14,619
tickets for that bit tickets already

00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:17,170
popular simply something where you can

00:12:14,619 --> 00:12:19,449
isolate the case on the web page for

00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:23,439
example and then handle the case

00:12:19,449 --> 00:12:25,990
completely this webpage it could be it

00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:27,910
could be you know white board

00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:31,270
if you're working if you if we were

00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:33,339
working a synchronously using this rule

00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:35,500
as over my Center we have a white board

00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:37,839
where we would make decisions that's

00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:41,459
totally totally viable the software we

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:44,200
usually use issue trackers or wiki's or

00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:46,360
something like that so if you want in

00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,580
this way to only meetings you have more

00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:52,149
team with more time to think which is

00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:53,980
very important and more precise if you

00:12:52,149 --> 00:12:56,560
work in the foreign language or if you

00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:59,560
shine if you have an in-person meeting

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,940
it's usually the loudmouth who get gets

00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,800
the attention you know we have people

00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:05,260
who are always talking they are good at

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,450
talking and they are good looking so

00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:11,260
everybody listens to them and then the

00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:13,870
poor guy is shy and you know or maybe

00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:16,540
even just if you need a bit more time to

00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:18,760
think you can you can miss you your turn

00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,920
someone ask you a question and you have

00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,570
this sweet person why don't we do if I

00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,940
can't I checked I left and you still

00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:28,420
thinking you know my to answer comes to

00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:32,040
me and maybe it was better and in this

00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:32,040
way you can take your time to think

00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:41,140
Derk Derk from burek is a passive member

00:13:36,339 --> 00:13:43,540
who is activity IETF you know big

00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,610
standards organization he told me that

00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,350
these guys did happy things they will

00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:49,930
spend a weekend talking about new

00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:52,660
standards they do not make the decisions

00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:53,050
at the meeting on purpose they leave it

00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,329
open

00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:57,459
they go up to the option stage and then

00:13:55,329 --> 00:14:00,490
they make the decision later unveiling

00:13:57,459 --> 00:14:03,250
is pretty difficult actually just to

00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:06,100
give also people you know if you English

00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:08,620
is not you were your main language you

00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:10,480
take any need more time maybe if so much

00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:13,600
big spots with an accent you don't

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:17,079
understand so the you know there's ways

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:20,850
to couple that with singers meetings in

00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:20,850
a very efficient way so there's

00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:37,940
so I think we have we have defined what

00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:45,410
it is - a bit about magic and let's talk

00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:47,600
about why I already talked about my my

00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,730
father was a carpenter we he had his

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,480
workshop on the basement and we had the

00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:56,870
flat on the first floor and quite often

00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:59,390
he was late for lunch and he excused

00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:02,770
what they were brewing this you know

00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:02,770
it's called gluing the piece of wood

00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:08,960
that it's talking wound so if we would

00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:11,570
have insisted on him being at noon shop

00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:14,000
at home for lunch he wouldn't be the

00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:17,120
less efficient we would have stopped the

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,279
flow to be started when you do software

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:23,800
it the same thing there's very good blog

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:27,050
post by Paul Graham you were here about

00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:30,440
maker schedule versus manager schedule

00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:32,960
if you manager and you you week is done

00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,550
of meetings if you have one more meeting

00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:41,720
say one hour

00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:44,030
it's one folio of your week you know

00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,800
it's just one more slot and that's it so

00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:49,010
it's easy to accept anyone home eating

00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:51,040
if you a software developer you probably

00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:54,140
know what it needs you in the zone you

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,839
you start with something complex and it

00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:59,050
is two hours uninterrupted otherwise if

00:15:56,839 --> 00:15:59,050
you

00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:03,520
so that's the lady scheduled someone who

00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:06,190
works on break the schedule someone

00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:08,290
who's creating things they need their

00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:10,540
blocks of time are interrupted and

00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:12,790
meetings are more expensive for those

00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:15,160
people because the meeting can destroy

00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:17,860
your flow session which was would

00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:20,170
otherwise ask three hours so that's the

00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,400
that's the the big difference

00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,560
and then that's something you have to

00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,750
explain to the managers you know tell

00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:29,020
them okay you're inviting these five

00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:31,930
liberals for your meeting think about it

00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:39,190
think how much it can cost them actually

00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:42,730
terms of energy flow cycles so meetings

00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:44,620
are extremely expensive somewhat I was

00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:48,460
reading a lot earlier today and the guy

00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:50,050
said if you have to expense the cost of

00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:53,890
you meeting every time people would

00:16:50,050 --> 00:17:02,440
think you do a meeting and after that

00:16:53,890 --> 00:17:04,360
you have to expect $4,000 so I think we

00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:06,699
have to think about that and people

00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:09,780
should be very careful I'm well known in

00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:12,579
my company for rejecting most meetings

00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:15,220
after lecture you know being a principal

00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:19,780
scientist that I have the luxury to be

00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:22,800
able to say no called you for meeting

00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,800
there's no agenda

00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:32,580
to do if an I found no way to prepare

00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:33,149
for a meeting usually I will just reject

00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,669
it

00:17:33,149 --> 00:17:38,580
sometimes there's good reasons but I

00:17:35,669 --> 00:17:42,630
think would indicate and it's so easy to

00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:44,880
for meeting to fail you know oh oh we

00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:49,830
forgot to invite Bob we cannot make the

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:52,019
decision or to come or there's no people

00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:54,450
there's meeting you know people think

00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:57,059
that meeting will magically so things it

00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:58,789
doesn't we don't understand what's being

00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:01,769
said

00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:07,289
people aren't you there very often

00:18:01,769 --> 00:18:09,750
should organize it in a way that people

00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:14,250
can come prepared there are many ways

00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:17,419
for meetings to fail so I think meeting

00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:19,950
up treasures I love me a lot high-energy

00:18:17,419 --> 00:18:21,720
brainstorming vision meetings look a

00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:26,639
fantastic weather if you can be with

00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:29,190
people in room and and draw crazy ideas

00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:32,039
that's so much more efficient people do

00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:35,179
do that in person doing the status

00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:38,909
meeting in person is a big waste of time

00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:40,820
Jason fired from base now wrote a blog

00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:43,230
post on it two weeks ago

00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:47,600
you know status meeting you have one

00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:49,890
person talking all your listening

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:53,010
probably 80% of them

00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:55,920
interested this better way of doing that

00:18:53,010 --> 00:19:01,920
and we can release mechanisms we can we

00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:05,550
can I think avoid any research okay so

00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:09,140
we have talked about what it is why and

00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:09,140
let's talk about how we do it

00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:19,210
so let's let's dig a bit more into the

00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:21,940
tools and I'll try to be more concrete

00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:27,820
and talk about the tools that week we

00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:29,860
use so typically I would say my favorite

00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:32,080
way of organizing that working that's

00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:35,820
that's how we try to do that's how our

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:39,840
egg you do that in rotating in my work

00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:43,000
is to use mailing lists for the

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:46,060
discussions so that the shared channel

00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,510
is making it it can also be a slack

00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:51,610
channel slack is very popular these days

00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:53,800
the problem is like that it's quite is

00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:56,890
how to catch up if you were away

00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:58,360
if you sometimes you have decisions that

00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:01,030
take three months because they are

00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:04,180
complex and you have to try things and

00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:06,310
come back with the mailing list and an

00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:08,560
archive it's also difficult it's

00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:11,740
possible to really catch up and find the

00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:15,130
thread and the interesting trend slack I

00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:19,879
think or other channels I think even

00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:22,190
lots of disability before we can

00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:25,729
not so far but for me that the default

00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:29,690
setup is a very least earlier for the

00:20:25,729 --> 00:20:31,940
discussions and then an attractor my

00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:34,249
favorite is a get get tickets I think

00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:37,069
worked pretty well for for discussions

00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:41,419
that lead to decisions they are concise

00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:44,749
they delete people to quoting infinity

00:20:41,419 --> 00:20:46,639
you know the worst maybe is the worst is

00:20:44,749 --> 00:20:50,929
people using Outlook which prevents them

00:20:46,639 --> 00:20:53,239
from doing same quoting then you get

00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:55,519
messages that or you get shadow

00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:57,949
discussions you don't know exactly what

00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:59,479
the person is replying to and I need

00:20:57,949 --> 00:21:02,869
tickets for that so for me that's the

00:20:59,479 --> 00:21:04,639
good so in my case I would say share the

00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:07,459
same communications channels the rating

00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:10,249
is used with discipline because neither

00:21:07,459 --> 00:21:14,119
and then the case where the tool is for

00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:16,459
me is due to our audience and and what's

00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:17,419
difficult is knowing when to switch from

00:21:16,459 --> 00:21:19,789
one to the next

00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:22,069
you know you start a discussion which

00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:23,869
think will lead to a decision at some

00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:26,389
point you have to you have to believe

00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:28,669
the rainiest becomes too specific too

00:21:26,389 --> 00:21:31,579
precise okay we have done with great

00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:33,499
scoring option space we move now to the

00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:36,859
year to the tracker to do the

00:21:33,499 --> 00:21:40,989
formalizing clarification of the earth

00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:44,329
of the decision so the brainstorming

00:21:40,989 --> 00:21:46,759
definitely used this channel that's

00:21:44,329 --> 00:21:48,909
where meetings can be extremely powerful

00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:52,299
when it's going as

00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:54,429
as I said in the same room or even with

00:21:52,299 --> 00:21:57,399
the digital white we would be much more

00:21:54,429 --> 00:22:00,519
efficient at spending time to discuss so

00:21:57,399 --> 00:22:02,320
again maybe a combination of synchronous

00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:04,989
and asynchronous depending on how you

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,989
can do it there the second phase is the

00:22:04,989 --> 00:22:12,190
options it will often happen on the

00:22:07,989 --> 00:22:14,200
ownership channel but then it's maybe

00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:16,659
maybe at that point where it makes sense

00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:19,359
to move to the case management tool to

00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:21,639
the issue tracker to define clearly what

00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:24,070
are the options that we have and maybe

00:22:21,639 --> 00:22:26,049
have links to details to prototypes to

00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:28,149
whatever and then you keep just the

00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:31,479
skeleton the backbone of the decision in

00:22:28,149 --> 00:22:33,820
the in the tracker then for the

00:22:31,479 --> 00:22:37,419
consensus building it's also often a

00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:41,259
combination of both if if the consensus

00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:43,479
is very hard to to emerge you might need

00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:48,899
lots of discussions and this might be

00:22:43,479 --> 00:22:48,899
easier because it's unstructured

00:22:48,989 --> 00:22:53,099
disruption it's really complicated

00:22:54,629 --> 00:23:02,529
dd the history of the actual consensus

00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:06,460
should be in the ticket because we want

00:23:02,529 --> 00:23:08,440
to document that what also often happens

00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,570
with decisions is that we have people

00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:13,119
who come up later they come back from

00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:15,700
vacation or they join the team later I'd

00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:17,679
love to explain the decisions to them if

00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:20,799
they can find the information here oh

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,570
you know only older on the basics of the

00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,639
decision should be documented in the

00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:26,559
ticket then we don't have to spend one

00:23:24,639 --> 00:23:28,149
hour explaining them they can read and

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,669
get most of the information in

00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:33,340
self-service then in my table I will

00:23:30,669 --> 00:23:35,259
find questions that we can really find a

00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:38,470
history of the decision and I think it

00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:41,340
can be extremely valuable to keep the

00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:41,340
trace of our

00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:46,820
consensus so I would do also different

00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:49,790
senses in the tractor except if it's

00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:54,910
messy then it's five you are proceeding

00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:54,910
in and then the decision itself is

00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:12,740
either something that we see in many

00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:14,870
incubating Apache project these are

00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:16,700
people want to vote on everything they

00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:19,280
say oh you know Apache plus what this

00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:21,380
one you don't need to vote on everything

00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:23,840
we do is to build consensus how you

00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:26,330
build it does not matter if it the best

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,460
is what the consensus just emerges from

00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:30,710
the discussion and it's not maybe you

00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:34,010
have both or if it's a bit conflictual

00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:36,560
then the world because if you see a

00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:39,530
picture we have 12 people who are four

00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:42,080
should be 300 people from from Celia

00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:45,670
with reasons so maybe use your equity of

00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:49,700
some people there's something to look at

00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:52,970
sorry the Apache Kogi ghouls are very

00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:54,950
good for creating consensus where it

00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:59,510
doesn't emerge naturally we don't have

00:24:54,950 --> 00:25:00,570
to use them is the consensus and of the

00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:04,440
document

00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:06,870
it's you know so that the history is as

00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:10,080
is here for people who need them to look

00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:11,789
at later and one thing again the

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,389
principles are not in software

00:25:11,789 --> 00:25:16,950
development because project like that we

00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:19,380
we do it in software because that's

00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:23,789
where people work remotely or not but

00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:27,149
you could totally use it so this is this

00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:29,809
is my view and again the where where you

00:25:27,149 --> 00:25:33,240
team needs to get used to doing this is

00:25:29,809 --> 00:25:35,850
especially how to use the tools you know

00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,440
the baton is aniket the disappeared

00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:39,450
already using different channel

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,210
what's the discipline for your channel

00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:43,679
while speaking about marine radio on the

00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:46,649
marine radio you have very specific

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,929
rules twister so the the broadcast

00:25:46,649 --> 00:25:51,649
channels are too busy and you move away

00:25:48,929 --> 00:25:55,049
to different channel to talk and so on

00:25:51,649 --> 00:25:57,269
so you need you need time for your team

00:25:55,049 --> 00:25:59,149
to get used to that doesn't come

00:25:57,269 --> 00:26:01,860
magically so and it's good to have

00:25:59,149 --> 00:26:04,440
coaches or to have someone who's kind of

00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:07,080
the shepherd of his process and then can

00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:10,019
look at it and try to prove it as as you

00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:16,649
go so the tools are this one thing is of

00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:18,659
course it's mostly about building

00:26:16,649 --> 00:26:21,389
consensus and that's where that's where

00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:25,490
I come with my example from the Swiss

00:26:21,389 --> 00:26:25,490
government and usually actually

00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:33,490
just a little bit of it they use a

00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:37,660
system to create the agenda agenda for

00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:38,350
their weekly meetings and they talk

00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:44,200
about it

00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:46,510
they use colonists but what I

00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,730
highlighted here this is a page from the

00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:51,700
Swiss ball that describes how they make

00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:53,770
decisions and they also say the Swiss

00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,780
government so the Swiss born the sweet

00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:58,870
zone is governed by a Council of seven

00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:00,640
people they have to agree you know they

00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:03,520
have to get consensus to make a decision

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,830
and they say it decides by consensus

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,990
whenever possible and sometimes also

00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:10,660
possible so it's exactly the same thing

00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:13,060
so we are sharing to see that even Tony

00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:17,440
outside of the software world which also

00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:20,590
work remotely you know use the same

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,330
principles and also this is important

00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:24,060
we've also seen some some Apache

00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:27,430
projects who are confused about that

00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:29,860
consensus does not mean unanimity in our

00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:32,710
context consensus it means widespread

00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:35,290
agreement means you know most of us

00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:38,950
breathe if you go to dinner tonight with

00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:40,990
with France you might not have unanimity

00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:42,970
on where to go but you see a majority

00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:44,980
wants to go to this kind of place so

00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:47,560
let's let's go there that's the same

00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:49,840
same thing so that's where consensus is

00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:52,420
best one that doesn't emerge then you

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,490
need ways to to build it and that's

00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:57,460
where the Apache voting rules are very

00:27:54,490 --> 00:28:01,059
useful and then they pretty well

00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:03,610
that page you know the plus one minus

00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:05,559
one is ease these things one also one

00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:09,820
important thing in Apache is that the

00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:11,590
Bettles there's a very restricted way to

00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:13,870
use a vector we don't want weight

00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:15,429
vectors in Apache in general because if

00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:18,820
they took and are also want to block

00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:21,640
something at some point it's better to

00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:24,100
have a suboptimal decision that you have

00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:27,010
no decision at all and we stopped so

00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:36,039
that's why we were restricted on to wait

00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:39,520
and okay let's I'm going to present what

00:28:36,039 --> 00:28:41,980
we done with the theory and I'll show a

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,470
few examples of where where this is used

00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:47,169
and you see that that people can use

00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:49,980
very different tools but the basic

00:28:47,169 --> 00:28:49,980
principles are the same

00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:58,950
a very interesting example which is

00:28:55,610 --> 00:29:02,100
informed but very useful as a Cordova

00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:06,000
discuss it's just a git repository that

00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:12,570
the the magical device project a whole

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:15,059
library and they have they have this kit

00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:17,880
Ramsey free which is used to propose

00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:20,780
projects proposed extensions or propose

00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:25,940
new things both project they probably

00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:25,940
you know they looked at the baby list

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:34,230
structure so what they did is that if

00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:36,419
you want say for example you want to

00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:44,370
create a version of cocoa before the

00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:46,830
BlackBerry from 1995 because how do we

00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:49,230
go about doing that so you'd first the

00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:52,169
stem root we have defined their their

00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:53,520
own process you create a ticket so it

00:29:52,169 --> 00:29:54,990
cannot do the opposite that I was

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:58,010
telling you that's why it's interesting

00:29:54,990 --> 00:30:00,539
because it cost rewards if you want to

00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:03,150
propose a new project you create the

00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:04,650
ticket saying I would like to do that

00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:07,140
when you think and then come the

00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:09,510
dispersion in the ticket so the ticket

00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:11,070
is your share chatter it's pretty nice

00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:13,860
because you have you know you have one

00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:17,549
ticket per discussion you know mix them

00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:20,539
up as I said the get tickets need people

00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,539
to do same coding

00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:28,540
then the the basics of the ticket is to

00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:31,059
decide whether we want to make that

00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:33,520
project on so the first stage getting

00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:35,710
your project accepted and then if it's

00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:39,270
if people say okay we think we should do

00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:42,280
that then we create a document lockdown

00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:44,559
text file here in this regulatory which

00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:47,230
describe what you want to do and then we

00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:49,390
would we find it using the ticket to

00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:52,000
comment on the refinements that we do

00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:54,400
and then the the final decision would be

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,190
accepting this document as something

00:30:54,400 --> 00:31:00,610
that we should've got a project that's

00:30:56,190 --> 00:31:02,860
pretty cool it's pretty simple Expedia

00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:04,929
isolated you could you could work on the

00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:07,059
tickets that were interested and talk

00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:09,820
ignore the rest which is very good so I

00:31:07,059 --> 00:31:12,130
think that any good alternative to using

00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:14,230
the many ways was something we need just

00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:17,230
a bit more structure to make a first

00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:19,330
decision to do the project a lot and

00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:21,940
then many small decisions to refine

00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:24,309
document inscribe the project

00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:27,820
Tobias approach don't really think you

00:31:24,309 --> 00:31:30,370
know this can work very very efficiently

00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:34,590
so it's interesting here to see that the

00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:34,590
total different the process is exactly

00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:43,809
this is how we do it in the same project

00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:45,759
so sling is a is a so work framework as

00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:46,809
it's a small project but it's one where

00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:50,590
an active spot

00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:53,109
I know it well so we do it kind of the

00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:54,879
opposite way as I was saying we use the

00:31:53,109 --> 00:31:57,279
mailing list for brainstorming what you

00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:59,489
want to do something we usually use the

00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:01,960
mailing list to debug the options I

00:31:59,489 --> 00:32:05,529
would say also it works here because

00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:10,389
it's a freeze on project just maybe 10

00:32:05,529 --> 00:32:14,529
to 12 active meters so it's pretty and

00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:17,169
then we usually we create ticket to this

00:32:14,529 --> 00:32:19,629
priority over sadly that's where we get

00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:22,119
the consensus maybe with additional

00:32:19,629 --> 00:32:24,460
discussions on Amazing Race and then if

00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:27,009
that works might have a vote

00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:29,499
and then the final result is a is a

00:32:27,009 --> 00:32:32,169
ticket in a tracker which is pretty key

00:32:29,499 --> 00:32:34,509
doesn't have all the noise of the

00:32:32,169 --> 00:32:36,879
discussions that we're here I usually

00:32:34,509 --> 00:32:39,219
throw away also decision is made by

00:32:36,879 --> 00:32:40,929
puppet on the detail and you try to have

00:32:39,219 --> 00:32:43,149
the ticket that describes the gist of

00:32:40,929 --> 00:32:46,419
the decision-making without all the

00:32:43,149 --> 00:32:48,940
noise that goes wrong it is a lot of it

00:32:46,419 --> 00:32:54,149
is about that you know separating the

00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:54,149
noise from the actual consensus building

00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:05,160
and this is also examples from

00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:07,080
non-software the global fields on the

00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:09,930
left is the Apache Board of Directors

00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:12,480
which makes a lot of decisions every

00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:15,230
month so the way the way the board works

00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,550
the you know the core of the world work

00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:20,430
or an important part of their maximum

00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:23,010
work is to approve the reports of the

00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:25,260
protests every Apache project has to do

00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:28,110
a report every three months then board

00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:30,450
us to decide to approve or maybe ask for

00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:34,380
compliments or maybe a reject the river

00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:38,400
and we do that completely separately we

00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:41,070
approve about 70 to 80 projects every

00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,730
month in a meeting that has two hours at

00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:44,790
most

00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:46,590
and is not only about that so it's

00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:50,220
pretty efficient we make like you know

00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:54,800
80 decisions in one hour for meeting

00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:57,630
people from different cultures the

00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:59,520
native speakers who sort of like to ask

00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:02,280
people to repeat and so on so it's not

00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:04,230
capacity it's not a fantastically

00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:06,360
efficient call that is sufficient for

00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:08,790
two reasons first we use a back channel

00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:12,240
during the call we have an IRC chat

00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:14,169
channel fathers jobs and you know what

00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:17,379
did he say

00:34:14,169 --> 00:34:19,179
relations and so on and the other reason

00:34:17,379 --> 00:34:20,290
why it's efficient is that everything is

00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:22,929
prepared in a boss

00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:25,139
we we have a very simple case management

00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:28,089
system which is a single text file and

00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:30,429
where we have one paragraph or one

00:34:28,089 --> 00:34:32,889
section for each decision and then we

00:34:30,429 --> 00:34:35,020
can put comments you know I put my

00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:37,299
initials and I write a comment in this

00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:39,970
file so just one finds it extremely

00:34:37,299 --> 00:34:41,679
simple system but which has the

00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:44,440
attributes of the case management system

00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:46,929
every case is a few lines of text with a

00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:51,010
definite structure and then you work it

00:34:46,929 --> 00:34:53,440
out and we use the phone to take care of

00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:56,049
the coordination so it works is very

00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,880
simple but the key is that the meeting

00:34:56,049 --> 00:35:00,730
is prepared there's lots of preparation

00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:02,829
every one of us spends maybe one or two

00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:04,630
hours preparing the rating our reading

00:35:02,829 --> 00:35:05,319
the comments in advance is pre-planned

00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:08,410
to them

00:35:05,319 --> 00:35:10,809
so that we can solve as many or make as

00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:12,010
many decisions before the meeting and

00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:14,829
then in meeting we'll just have to

00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:18,099
formalizing decisions we have a system

00:35:14,829 --> 00:35:21,220
some Ruby with continued as president as

00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:23,770
we're writing we'll see a tool for that

00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:25,839
and then we can see the decisions out of

00:35:23,770 --> 00:35:28,119
this text file with some simple policy

00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:32,319
you see decisions are either green or

00:35:28,119 --> 00:35:34,690
orange or red and it tells us if we

00:35:32,319 --> 00:35:37,869
already agree of any discussions and so

00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:39,549
on and interestingly the the Swiss

00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:42,930
government works in the same way as were

00:35:39,549 --> 00:35:45,029
saying this is also from the same page

00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:47,279
whether present the way they work they

00:35:45,029 --> 00:35:49,529
have they have very good lists for the

00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:52,140
agenda but which are which are on

00:35:49,529 --> 00:35:55,529
different colors so for example the

00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:58,020
orange list is the item so on which they

00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:59,730
agree so they know in advance that they

00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:01,440
agree because there are some preparation

00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:04,349
and then admitting they just need to

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,059
check formally they need to approve them

00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:10,109
in the meeting that's a requirement of

00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:11,339
their parliamentary process anybody go

00:36:10,109 --> 00:36:13,829
very fast

00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:15,779
I don't know I have not been in their

00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:19,680
sessions you can do that if you know the

00:36:15,779 --> 00:36:24,140
federal transfer but maybe they say

00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:31,349
items 12 to 24 the orange list is anyone

00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:34,140
moving them then they have a different

00:36:31,349 --> 00:36:36,240
the blue Beast has responses to

00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:38,760
furniture requests so this might need a

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:43,770
bit more discussion before we can reach

00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:47,309
this decision and the white list items

00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:49,020
are this they say a discussion decided

00:36:47,309 --> 00:36:52,049
one by one due to their political

00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:54,329
importance you can read behind that that

00:36:52,049 --> 00:36:55,770
is no consensus of these items so we

00:36:54,329 --> 00:36:57,990
need in the meeting to build the

00:36:55,770 --> 00:37:00,059
consensus the good thing is that if you

00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:02,700
start with the easy ones you will have

00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:04,500
mainly gone 50 decisions then it takes

00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:14,730
just 10 minutes and then you can take

00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:18,029
the most and the they take about 2,500

00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:20,039
decisions each year and in a journey in

00:37:18,029 --> 00:37:23,299
a weekly meeting which lasts a few hours

00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:23,299
we certainly

00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:29,350
there it's interesting to see that the

00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:31,330
principles are similar and these are

00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:34,860
these are these are synchronous meetings

00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:37,330
so it's it's a hybrid combination of

00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:39,400
preparing the meeting as if it was a

00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:41,380
synchronous Oh everything you can do in

00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:44,050
a synchronous way and then keep the

00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:45,640
meeting just for the visit of the things

00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:47,650
where it really makes sense to be

00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:49,480
together because it's difficult because

00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:52,000
it's more efficient because it's complex

00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:53,230
and any brainstorming and so on and both

00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,870
the Apache board and the Swiss

00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:59,620
government work in the same ways you

00:37:55,870 --> 00:38:01,780
know we sometimes even sometimes say

00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:05,820
that the Apache Software Foundation is

00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:05,820
the streets another food source this is

00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:11,770
yeah it's interesting to see that they

00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:14,740
can be different tools to implement the

00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:17,710
same things it's just the concept and

00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:19,510
here we see that the hybrid you know

00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:21,790
between it's not because you have a

00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:24,490
meeting in person that you don't have to

00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:26,770
create prepare it and if you can throw

00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:28,960
away half of the reactants before the

00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:34,270
meeting is fantastic it saves time in

00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:34,690
the meeting for the interesting that's

00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:39,490
it

00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:42,010
so we have seen 3d tools so you either

00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:44,230
share the secrets communications channel

00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:46,840
I need a case when I have the tool which

00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:49,210
can be as simple as our text file for

00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:51,850
the actual code or oh my god if the

00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:54,100
meeting happens in this room then we are

00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:57,360
the four phases brainstorming options

00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:59,890
consensus decision where you need to

00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:03,630
adequately switch from one two to the

00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:03,630
next based on which way you walk

00:39:03,730 --> 00:39:11,920
and this is where you t buy into the

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:14,109
abuse to to doing that then yeah it's

00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,820
requires practice and we need to adapt

00:39:14,109 --> 00:39:17,260
it to your own culture there's no

00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:19,599
one-size-fits-all I think what's

00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:22,000
important is to focus on the basic

00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:24,849
principles and then you can adapt up to

00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,940
your own team again the goal is to keep

00:39:24,849 --> 00:39:30,550
things efficient and fun you know if you

00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:33,190
have as I was saying if you are meeting

00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:35,800
while you're discussing big ideas it's

00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:37,900
it's really fun it's really efficient

00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:42,460
that's why it makes all the difference

00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:44,140
to be able to gather the same room if

00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:46,359
you own little conference to do boring

00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:48,970
stuff it's boring

00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:51,160
so we have to we have to be careful I

00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:53,859
have a reading list I have a number of

00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:56,050
articles a lot of maybe some of mine

00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:59,800
that also links to other people's

00:39:56,050 --> 00:40:02,460
articles in this on this URL and this is

00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:05,470
something that I mean a solid is you're

00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:08,609
defining more precisely the requirements

00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:12,430
for the central signals channel because

00:40:08,609 --> 00:40:14,770
never seen before I think slow slack is

00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:17,560
very popular today I don't think it was

00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:20,050
fantastically for for in this world and

00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:22,359
I'm so I'm trying to define it more

00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:25,300
precisely we have to say no if we have

00:40:22,359 --> 00:40:27,670
this function then it would work for me

00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:30,370
so for me the favorite to instilling

00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:32,080
rainiest but as I said

00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:35,500
yes require a lot of discipline to be

00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:40,180
efficient and fun so if anyone is even

00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:42,670
to look at me that's what I have

00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:45,310
thank you for being here we attention

00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:48,420
and I'm I'm open for questions will as

00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:48,420
I'm standing between you

00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:58,199
