Title: #FOSSBack 17: Luciano Resende - How mentoring projects can help newcomers get started w Open Source
Publication date: 2017-11-27
Playlist: FOSS Backstage Micro-Summit 2017
Description: 
	As adoption of Open Source code and development practices continues to gain momentum, more newcomers have become interested in getting involved and contributing to Open Source. However,  it's usually not easy for newcomers to start contributing to open source projects. This session will discuss how mentoring programs can ease the way for newcomers to get started with open source, and will discuss existing mentoring programs such as Google Summer of Code and our in-house Apache Mentoring Programme.

Luciano Resende is an Architect at IBM Spark Technology Center. He has been contributing to open source at The Apache Software Foundation for over 10 years, he is a member of ASF and is currently contributing to various big data related Apache projects including Apache Spark, Apache Zeppelin, Apache Bahir, Apache Toree and Apache SystemML. Luciano is the project chair for Apache Bahir, and also spend time mentoring newly created Apache Incubator projects. Recently, Luciano has started contributing to Jupyter Ecosystem projects around Enterprise Notebook Platform. At IBM, he contributed to several IBM big data offerings, including BigInsights, IOP and its respective Bluemix Cloud services.

I'm going to be talking a little bit

00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:22,610
about undeath which is a community

00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:25,310
development TMC why mentoring the

00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:28,190
available programs in how they they were

00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:31,310
kind of thing how you can go about

00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:39,409
finding mentors and help about finding

00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:42,680
project ideas contribute just to anyone

00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:45,890
here that has not been contributing to

00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:49,210
open source that is come to come nev are

00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:49,210
just getting started officers

00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:54,770
so what it today if we look at me

00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:58,550
everywhere I go and every type of

00:01:54,770 --> 00:02:01,670
project that I see open source is it's

00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:03,610
interesting if I'm building services and

00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:07,100
again from work talking about at fault

00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:09,019
it's very rarely to see a project

00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:12,350
started from scratch not utilizing

00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:17,680
officer so I can get involved

00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:17,680
we have to do today or tomorrow

00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:26,960
what is it beneficial to get involve it

00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:29,240
for individual I mean you learn new

00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:32,510
skills new technology you get all our

00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:34,730
visibility as well if you're looking on

00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,470
a proprietary software not going to the

00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:41,930
community you just have to really show

00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:51,920
people understand you when you start

00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:56,360
working on communities I think you're

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:58,190
building more your visibility outside

00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,350
for everybody to see how you're

00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,700
performing to know your skills but you

00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:03,230
also contribute to the community

00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:07,850
beautiful project that you might be

00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:09,590
using internal usually people that come

00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:13,040
from the background are often using just

00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:15,590
like Burberry software they tend and I

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,870
have seen all that they just like pork

00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:20,330
and make the fixes in China so if you

00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:23,870
familiar or if you know people directly

00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:27,140
that maybe try to tell them what is some

00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:31,270
of the benefits try to get there to come

00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:31,270
to the community providers patches make

00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,110
for the company is the same thank you

00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:41,060
you have the name of the company lots of

00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:42,830
people that are looking for jobs and

00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,300
things like that they will recognize

00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:47,840
companies that are working on open

00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:49,280
source they also get a competitive edge

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,870
you're not getting a software like

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,620
cricket who is working out

00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:56,590
it's basically tested and gone through

00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:59,590
use case or scenarios from different

00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:12,769
companies from all over the world which

00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:21,500
makes the quality and one of the things

00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:25,940
that we did remember when we had initial

00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:29,870
meeting I get back to home and we decide

00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:32,419
that we went over that the idea is we

00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:35,600
were so we were perpetually was a very

00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:38,660
successful foundation of projects and

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,570
everything and why was that mostly

00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:44,780
around the way we do things what we call

00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:48,470
in a gradual way but also we really

00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:51,780
value community over code I mean having

00:04:48,470 --> 00:05:00,050
a piece of code that has no

00:04:51,780 --> 00:05:02,880
or whatever but like maintaining power

00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:04,740
might not be very good have a community

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,600
that goes around and abandons the

00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:11,280
project I think it's very important

00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:13,110
because if I mean let's change the

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,420
things that you're doing so like if one

00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,610
or two people that are contributing have

00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:19,890
to kind of like go away or step aside

00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,930
you still get that project continue

00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:26,580
you're still going to have life into the

00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:29,160
project so the the contact MC what

00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,590
because basically the idea to promote

00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:34,680
that get more community involvement get

00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:36,870
things you know in a way that benefits

00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,610
all the projects and in the central way

00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:41,190
instead of like each product trying to

00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:43,410
vote and do their community outrage that

00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:47,540
the Condor tries to centralize as we

00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,540
have people looking to the community

00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:55,920
basically if we wanna practice Emily the

00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:58,290
television for circuit community help

00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,710
others understand the Apache ways of how

00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,710
magic works

00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:11,930
if you offered us to contribute why do

00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:16,610
we need confidence to contribute

00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:20,570
why why people maybe kind of life yet

00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:22,550
afraid to come to software I mean I've

00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:26,000
been working on IBM for a very very long

00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:30,020
time and I still today talk with people

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,360
that are doing very useful and new

00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:35,270
technologies inside IBM as proprietary

00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,030
software that when we start talking

00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:40,970
about open source and then you have to

00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:46,190
come to a mailing list to discuss ideas

00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:48,800
or or come and give it at all the things

00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:50,660
that they are doing so that people start

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:55,310
to know about the technology it can come

00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:58,370
and contribute to your project they they

00:06:55,310 --> 00:07:00,140
are really afraid of doing that they try

00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:04,280
the software the software is good but I

00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:06,430
think the community aspect it is really

00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,590
is really complicated

00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:12,470
so what I see when I talk to those folks

00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,800
to visit Lee this is how they see open

00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:16,250
source

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:19,040
it's like really scary thing for them

00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,729
and then when I start talking with them

00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,370
other things

00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:25,089
they have to do that's how I see them

00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:28,580
like very kind of my crying baby no I

00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:31,069
want to do that come on and it's very

00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:32,180
complicated and it's a very love these

00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:37,909
questions when we do that for the first

00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:39,559
time but then you start becoming a

00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:42,229
mentor to them you start to tell them

00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:44,330
like well maybe help this is how you do

00:07:42,229 --> 00:07:48,349
things or maybe this is the benefits

00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:51,919
that you can have and what start with

00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:52,669
having that that thing that was really

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,240
scary

00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:59,360
well it's kind of okay now and you start

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:02,419
seeing them getting a bit happier being

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:07,219
able to come go to the maining this

00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:09,589
maybe they will send money per week but

00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:11,839
you encourage them and you get them and

00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,860
they will do all that collaboration on

00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,199
the community they will start

00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,300
understanding that they need to grow

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,389
their community and that's like some of

00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:23,240
these things that the managers can bring

00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:24,680
to the students or maybe they can and

00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,899
they can bring to people that are

00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:32,060
starting to get involved in open source

00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:34,159
but I mean this is kind of like the

00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:36,229
society from

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:39,949
and how major can help them but what

00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:41,529
isn't that for the mentors the next to

00:08:39,949 --> 00:08:44,420
his life that kind of like saw

00:08:41,529 --> 00:08:47,569
presentations at which point did I think

00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:51,560
a couple of months ago that conference

00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:56,300
me in LA never happening and the idea is

00:08:51,560 --> 00:09:04,879
I mean anyone knows the picture and who

00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:07,370
is there he was there so this is

00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:11,629
Socrates I think if you know the name I

00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:15,050
mean now it's a very famous but starter

00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:16,879
it is delivered that writing down and

00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:18,949
doing any kind of like things around

00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:22,879
things that he was doing it was really

00:09:18,949 --> 00:09:26,209
detriment to the thoughts and the

00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:28,610
constructive debate that he had so he

00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:31,399
pretty much never write down anything

00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:34,610
that he was doing and everything he was

00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:39,589
fastened to recall to suppose or

00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:42,860
nineties talks or from lectures in the

00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:46,970
way that you become to know about him up

00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:49,540
to today is from the work that all did

00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:52,490
the South disciples the people that was

00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:55,639
learning from him started writing down

00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:58,939
and passing death to generation so I see

00:09:55,639 --> 00:10:03,870
as a mentor also being able to pass his

00:09:58,939 --> 00:10:06,490
legacy pass the things that he is doing

00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:09,250
because community in Chania of

00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:13,000
technologies to the other people within

00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:17,290
that those and girls and girls and just

00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,940
like some name so Socrates mental winter

00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:21,180
plateau which they have been to very

00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:24,910
spotless and you see they're about that

00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:31,029
start coming and we know how them all up

00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:34,240
to today so when we talk about mentoring

00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:36,310
like what we should expect that if you

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,560
if you if you get a mentor what you can

00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:40,360
expect from the matter so it's not that

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,670
the better is that I go and give you all

00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,670
the technical details and those things

00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,750
but there are metrics that are helping

00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:53,620
you kind of like in the community

00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:56,140
aspects not necessarily is the area of

00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:59,770
expertise of his technical expertise so

00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:01,480
you start getting help with things

00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:03,970
around the project dynamics from that

00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:08,290
words areas the needs improvement or

00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:09,910
areas that kind of like needs to get

00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,140
development order which is an

00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:15,310
opportunity for you to start

00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:17,740
contributing also I think a lot of

00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,730
people that come and basically say well

00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:23,480
this is not working

00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:25,879
I mean there are ways that questions can

00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,119
be asked where you will see these things

00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:34,730
really weird get attention and you'll

00:11:29,119 --> 00:11:37,429
see the the response is much faster and

00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:38,980
I think what is in what does the maker

00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:41,449
expect for I students I mean

00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:44,899
particularly myself it is my own opinion

00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:47,149
when I do mentoring I basically

00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:49,069
unexpected okay I really like the most

00:11:47,149 --> 00:11:53,059
not like paying it forward but but

00:11:49,069 --> 00:11:55,939
really I get really bland event for

00:11:53,059 --> 00:11:58,279
example I wasn't the last actually

00:11:55,939 --> 00:12:02,990
members meeting and I was saying like

00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:06,050
god that was being voted as a member and

00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:07,879
he started working in Apache it google

00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,949
Summer of Code as my kind of like

00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:11,569
maintain those kind of things where you

00:12:09,949 --> 00:12:14,209
see the guy speaking and now being a

00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:15,379
member contributing to multiple projects

00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:21,470
that those kind of things are really

00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:23,870
rewarding for me so let's take a look at

00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:25,999
for example some of the project if you

00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,709
really to matter if you in ferment or

00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:30,110
what are some of the programs that are

00:12:27,709 --> 00:12:33,060
available that we participated Apache

00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:35,760
welcome we are Apache

00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:37,830
so we have google Summer of Code the

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:42,750
google Summer of Code basically runs

00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:48,089
around summer vacation from the US and

00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:51,750
is intended for college university

00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:58,649
students you need to be 18 years or

00:12:51,750 --> 00:13:02,459
older and you need to be enrolled in a

00:12:58,649 --> 00:13:08,430
university at the time that to enroll

00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:12,830
into your into the product in terms of

00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:17,100
some stats here in 2007 we had around

00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:24,660
1300 students accepted from 72 different

00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:27,540
countries 1600 active members 198 open

00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:30,570
source organizations and about 86

00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:34,320
percent of overall success of her and

00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:37,620
the idea here is Google we will pay a

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,540
steep and to the student to get them to

00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:42,390
know the community know how to work on

00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:45,150
open source already kind of like in

00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:49,640
their career or before even they started

00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:49,640
working so that gave me guess familiar

00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:55,910
opponents and something that just

00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:58,880
usually it takes a little while to

00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:01,650
happen but it was already a NASA there

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:04,350
is gonna be a 2008

00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:06,270
so if you guys are students or if you

00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:08,580
guys know these students you can start

00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:12,690
cooperating and try to get them involved

00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:15,300
and the way the project's the the the

00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:21,420
workflow to get accept that work and

00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:23,220
this is coming to all of the I'm going

00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,350
to talk about some gonna go a little bit

00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:29,070
into details here of an exercise and

00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:31,920
basically say the same way but their

00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:35,160
projects let's say inside Apache they

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:39,060
will create ideas project ideas in JIRA

00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,740
and tag them properly then at some point

00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,260
the students come they will look into

00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,830
those ideas they were looking to areas

00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:48,180
that they want to contribute and then

00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:51,810
provide a project or call so that then

00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:54,620
get ranked it by the people with the

00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:59,190
mentors and the administrators patricide

00:14:54,620 --> 00:15:02,570
reach them based on all the slots that

00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:05,820
Google gives to each of the organization

00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:10,260
those will get basically fulfilled by

00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:12,870
the students based on their mentor some

00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:15,720
of the kind of like a tips for

00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:18,050
succeeding at work oh I think in terms

00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,580
of the project just as early as possible

00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:25,380
start getting your project ideas out I

00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:28,140
start with the proper label so that it

00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:31,430
starts very visible to students and talk

00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:33,740
about those are major of those

00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:37,130
and elevation and profits that you guys

00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:39,950
read to me I think for the students the

00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:42,190
idea is too early on as early as

00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:47,630
possible start coming to the project

00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:49,430
know how the community works get into

00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:51,860
contact with the possible mentor and

00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:53,540
start trying to contribute this model

00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:57,260
here the quality just get a feeling of

00:15:53,540 --> 00:16:02,060
holidays that really count start getting

00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:06,800
accepted that and being successful at

00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:10,310
least on how we do it in the patchy here

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:12,860
are mostly references in in case you

00:16:10,310 --> 00:16:15,910
want to get more information

00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:17,360
google code-in it's a very similar

00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:22,790
project

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:25,670
he basically it's for students between

00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:29,450
the age 13 and 17 so like kinda high

00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:33,260
schoolers and the tasks are not

00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:34,790
necessarily a very deep code test we are

00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:37,220
sometimes documentation and things like

00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:39,740
that and I've seen that up at you have

00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:46,720
participated in a couple of times in

00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:50,930
this project similar acceptance workflow

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:55,000
similar kind of like a success tips or

00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:56,960
for projects and students one of the

00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,370
projects that are not necessarily

00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:04,190
specific for students is the outreach e

00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:05,480
is used to be called the average profit

00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:11,659
firm

00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:13,909
run by in you know and in 2016 or 15 I

00:17:11,659 --> 00:17:17,140
think they became more this kind of an

00:17:13,909 --> 00:17:22,370
outreach project that is it kind of grow

00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:26,949
more more generic and it basically is

00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:33,679
for minority groups in terms of like

00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:37,669
women african-american in those minority

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:39,470
groups of ten and this mostly becomes

00:17:37,669 --> 00:17:44,570
kind of a leadership during the summer

00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:47,919
time so a couple of more information

00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:51,260
here if you interested getting into a

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:53,630
similar workflow basically think they'll

00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:58,250
do a similar workflow in terms of

00:17:53,630 --> 00:18:00,470
acceptance of these students the

00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:04,820
outreach website if you guys wanna learn

00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:07,190
a little bit more we also try to do

00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,789
these in Apache we have a documented

00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:12,139
process

00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:16,190
this I think we we have done once and we

00:18:12,139 --> 00:18:19,549
are might be doing it twice soon in the

00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:21,429
idea is get some of the people that are

00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:24,499
mentoring students are mentoring folks

00:18:21,429 --> 00:18:26,659
and yet not necessarily my students but

00:18:24,499 --> 00:18:29,229
people in the industry that are not so

00:18:26,659 --> 00:18:31,639
familiar with open source to come and

00:18:29,229 --> 00:18:34,399
contribute to a magic projects that get

00:18:31,639 --> 00:18:35,269
from either with that I'm running I

00:18:34,399 --> 00:18:39,139
suppose

00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:42,559
pilot program with government in India a

00:18:39,139 --> 00:18:45,249
few years ago and I think right now

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,489
there is discussion from a University of

00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:48,590
Teague

00:18:46,489 --> 00:18:50,749
there are interested of doing the others

00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:53,749
of their students I might like I'm

00:18:50,749 --> 00:18:57,309
following the thread they try to do that

00:18:53,749 --> 00:18:57,309
for next year

00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:11,020
and we talk a lot for mateys and then

00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:13,390
with students and things like that there

00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:15,190
is also like the time where what I'm

00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:17,350
given a community upon your project and

00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:21,640
the way to do that and I've actually is

00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:23,500
through the imagine creator the idea is

00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,690
like any project or phase that are

00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:28,390
trying to enter the project needs to go

00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:30,610
through incubation you need to get a

00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:33,490
champion and at least three mentors to

00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:37,570
help you navigate and understand the

00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:40,740
Apache way into run releases

00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:44,620
successfully we've all the legal things

00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:46,029
properly done so this is more for the

00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:49,899
mentor sites that are trying to look for

00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:52,990
opportunities if we always need another

00:19:49,899 --> 00:19:55,840
extra hand in the air Patrick debater so

00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:57,760
if you guys are interested on that just

00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,809
some of the restrictions you need to be

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:09,840
a member of the IMC and for actual

00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:12,370
members can see email for those that

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,919
wanted together may want to be a painter

00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:16,630
have have experience with let's say and

00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:19,330
different qualities in the past but

00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:22,120
another memory sometimes were primary

00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:28,380
group there are gives you those guys as

00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:31,510
part of the agency for finding mentors

00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:33,850
usually you have a relationship know

00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:35,740
someone but it's not there is this app

00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:37,210
like for example if you want to know

00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:40,370
someone that speaks your language is

00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:47,740
close to you you can go to this

00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:47,740
find local mentors oh sorry

00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:54,890
and we're finding that selectively let

00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:57,260
me go quickly on the next step so please

00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:59,750
last finding product ideas that nature

00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:05,120
so we can go and run a query in JIRA

00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:07,430
with the text sometimes we used metric

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,760
for generic the ones and we have that

00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:14,210
you saw like in a year for the ones that

00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:16,280
they're doing there is also open hatch

00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:18,770
that are more generic ideas for products

00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:20,090
that are outside and I think one of the

00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:25,309
things that I want to mention here is

00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:26,870
like is not only about technology these

00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:30,260
are just like could be examples of

00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:32,990
people that are today like members of

00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:35,090
the International Foundation are running

00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:38,240
like all the ESS my

00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:41,060
or like Sarah that it when become that

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,590
they all have mostly contributed around

00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:46,460
community around the fermentation around

00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:48,290
communications so it's not all about

00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:50,150
hope it's about the community and the

00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:52,490
value that you bring to the community so

00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:57,250
you can come in contribute in much more

00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:59,930
different ways to just bringing over so

00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:01,760
what I want to share if you have

00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:08,530
questions that might be on your back so

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:08,530
