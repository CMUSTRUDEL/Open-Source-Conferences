Title: #FOSSBack 17: Krzysztof Daniel - Beware of geeks bearing gifts
Publication date: 2017-11-28
Playlist: FOSS Backstage Micro-Summit 2017
Description: 
	Open source software is one of the most important inventions of modern world. Sometimes, we create open source software because we believe it makes better world, and that everyone should be able to inspect the code and improve it, a.k.a. contribute back. While this is a very noble goal, business does not care about 'nobility'. 

What business cares about, is money. Therefore, open source software is usually created because of more down-to-earth reasons, such as (the list is not complete) cutting costs, desperation or ... intention to destroy competition. The latter is particularly interesting, only a few companies in the world has learned how to exploit this mechanism properly. I will reveal how open source can be weaponised, and what does it mean for governance and financing.   

Chris has spent the last 12 years in a variety of business roles including compliance, software engineering, quality assurance and software development and thus has broad experience ranging from IT through legal issues to business strategy.  Almost all of that work was related to open-source software. He is a passionate problem solver whilst always keeping a firm eye on the big picture. Chris has a Masters in Computer Science from Poznan University of Technology.

[Music]

00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:07,040
[Music]

00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:30,570
be in mind they associate risk you may

00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:30,570
wake up doing PowerPoint presentations

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:40,689
because you believe the right thing the

00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:44,050
best thing you could do for your product

00:01:40,689 --> 00:01:47,590
on the other hand if you are

00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:49,810
to stay with me we will look at the open

00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:51,850
source software from a completely

00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:55,210
different perspective from the

00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:58,120
perspective of value and money from the

00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:01,990
perspective where open source can show

00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:05,980
its architects there's only one problem

00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:10,510
with god human life because human mind

00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:18,640
is a pattern recognition occurs it can

00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:23,580
recognize what has been recognized just

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:30,220
like in this case all of you can see an

00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:47,980
accessible and people face pretty much

00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:50,140
pretty good picture and in this in this

00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:54,780
presentation I will try to show a couple

00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:57,630
of interesting uses of open source I

00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:01,390
shall introduce you to the bill Corbett

00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:04,980
this is the main person on this picture

00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:07,209
I like this picture very much because

00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:11,860
photo rockers are pretty much like

00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:14,140
developers they are and they are trying

00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:16,930
to do they drop the best way they can

00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:20,080
and this one here was hanging around

00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:22,870
this racetrack to make a photo of his

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,140
life instead of making a photo it might

00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:29,040
be became a subject of someone else for

00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,040
of Islam

00:03:30,390 --> 00:04:05,140
there hasn't been what can happen in

00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:09,160
their business therefore most of the

00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:11,739
business is done using this approach

00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:13,660
which is basically let's don't work the

00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:17,380
pills because fix the stubborn person

00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:20,709
other has been successful by bombarding

00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:23,290
is it is just good feeling min coping

00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:28,810
and little about understanding what's

00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:37,750
going what's going and I'm here to say

00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:40,080
doing the right thing with the right

00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:43,270
skills we are usually at the right time

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,580
but we fail to perform because we don't

00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:48,070
really understand what is going around

00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:54,270
us some of you may say I'm exaggerating

00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:54,270
but the fact is that 85% of IT projects

00:04:57,539 --> 00:05:01,530
are projects

00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,999
[Music]

00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:20,040
have you maybe heard of an open local

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:26,550
company that has created the one of the

00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:28,140
first iPhone Twitter's back in 2007 I'm

00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:32,880
not that you've been awesome

00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:37,290
one person did the the thing is they

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:41,790
wanted to create an open hardware open

00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:44,400
software form that would be software

00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:47,910
developer friendly and they have focused

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:51,630
so much on being open and being

00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:57,900
developer friendly the most important

00:05:51,630 --> 00:06:00,360
teacher comes out in 2007 because

00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:05,760
everyone knows that ordinary people need

00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:08,970
to have a shared concern even in setting

00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:11,910
up Wi-Fi network took an hour this is

00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:15,120
the DB embarrassed and setting up the

00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:18,240
phone a week or stop on the other hand

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,840
the most basic functionality was totally

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,020
broken

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,020
there was no support for the end

00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:41,180
[Music]

00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:43,550
it kind of War I what right now I should

00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:46,310
give you the challenge if you were about

00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:53,870
to choose in 2007 which solution would

00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:57,529
you prepare a closed-source iPhone not

00:06:53,870 --> 00:07:00,439
not necessary station or the open mode

00:06:57,529 --> 00:07:03,550
of open hardware open some software

00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:12,379
phone which one would be your trust

00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:16,180
hands up who's for open and we just take

00:07:12,379 --> 00:07:19,099
this is not how consumers can vote and

00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:21,529
this is I think one of the most

00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:27,860
important parts in this presentation

00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:31,189
open source open source as such will not

00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:35,990
bring you any sales is not accessible

00:07:31,189 --> 00:07:38,419
just barely a secondary production first

00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:42,139
of all you have to have the primary

00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:48,009
functionality and then you can compete

00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:53,659
with with alternative solutions based

00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:58,149
using open source as your advantage the

00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:58,149
project the general

00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,379
[Music]

00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,200
[Music]

00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:08,970
[Music]

00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:26,080
if I'm interested in a cup of tea the

00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:33,460
step number two is to understand what do

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:35,560
you need so it's a simple ask if you

00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:39,190
want to provide a cup of tea unique tea

00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:41,980
hot water in the cup if you need tea

00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:44,110
sorry if you need hot water you need

00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,790
some motor cutter and electricity and

00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,770
because

00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:49,350
an open-source presentation we will

00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:51,450
provide our own editor city and we have

00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:56,010
some battery battery requires an admin

00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:58,590
software this diagram is a simple value

00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:01,920
chain diagram which can be quite

00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:04,950
interesting especially if we add here

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,930
the visibility axis or value axis

00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:17,970
because what's on the top is important

00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:22,440
for the user now the thing is that money

00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:24,630
flow from the top till down because the

00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,180
user pays for our service the service

00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:30,030
provider needs to pay for own components

00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:32,220
and basically every component behaves

00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:36,270
like a glass try to gather as much money

00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:38,930
as possible kind of simplified but we'll

00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:41,610
do what we'll do for now

00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:44,580
this of course begs for question without

00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:47,550
open source which doesn't exist in that

00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:49,350
value chain at all will yet we'll get

00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:52,530
there soon but first we need to

00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:55,620
introduce the dose of evolution and have

00:10:52,530 --> 00:11:00,920
you maybe noticed that some things get

00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,920
popular we are very excited

00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:17,779
this is exciting

00:11:38,029 --> 00:11:54,359
it's like being excited it's not

00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:57,689
computing power does the same way and I

00:11:54,359 --> 00:12:00,959
would call this I mean I is not me but

00:11:57,689 --> 00:12:03,269
this process is called I wanted to show

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:06,049
you babies something interesting do you

00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:12,059
know what it is this is the first

00:12:06,049 --> 00:12:15,779
digital Tamara created in 1970 it took

00:12:12,059 --> 00:12:21,689
30 years before commercialized and you

00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:24,179
know everyone everyone but of course

00:12:21,689 --> 00:12:26,480
this process of evolution isn't a strike

00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:26,480
over

00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:32,920
and all those four faces are precisely

00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:35,350
named and certain characteristics but

00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:38,260
dependents that we can break our value

00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:40,360
chain up the able access will rise

00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,190
together much reaching geeky and a

00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,250
number of different attributes you can

00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:49,090
reassign components and what we get is a

00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:51,960
world a map now we are getting let's

00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:57,610
imagine for a second that we have a

00:12:51,960 --> 00:13:00,400
battery provider company the company

00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:04,480
provides the battery provider company

00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:07,600
ships batteries and in addition to the

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:10,210
physical devices come software if you

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:24,570
are this if you run this company which

00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:24,570
produce open source is that being broken

00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:34,360
it's good there it's kind of a right

00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,700
answer but the fact is that you should

00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,920
compare the cost of open source software

00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:41,890
and the cost of software and there are

00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,740
four major attributes which matter which

00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:46,660
is how much does it cost a license to

00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:50,050
suffer the software to get the knowledge

00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:53,800
and how much does it cost to exit from

00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:57,490
the open source software and if we did

00:13:53,800 --> 00:14:01,390
that we would have discovered that it is

00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:03,640
actually important because 67% of

00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:05,850
companies doesn't track the cost of

00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,510
using open source software

00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:12,190
bear in mind what I

00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:15,770
just said thanks to some numbers that

00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:19,940
believe that empty send a stretch with

00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:25,450
means zero for Madrid of companies using

00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:29,150
open source doesn't count which means

00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:32,540
that for an architect or for any

00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:36,250
developer the difference between open

00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:42,500
source and closed source code is really

00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:45,380
different winners or feeling a purchase

00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:53,000
order and getting a license process in

00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:56,780
weeks longer operation it means that the

00:14:53,000 --> 00:15:04,730
primary advantage of open source is how

00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:15,500
fast it spreads and some companies use

00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:18,650
it on purpose we will get back to but

00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,930
this is to show how this this chart

00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:25,970
shows view how the open source adoption

00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:33,170
effect how being oppressors affect the

00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:34,470
market a product know as a compound also

00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:36,660
the question

00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:43,050
I'll say company providing batteries you

00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:45,270
will prefer to start with the question

00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:48,540
is about all the other costs

00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:51,450
what about contributing but will you

00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:53,400
contribute that you will in the

00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:56,910
beginning when the software is unstable

00:15:53,400 --> 00:16:01,170
because you don't want to maintain your

00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:09,180
own software becomes more and more

00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:13,770
venture you will develop and we will end

00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:16,320
up with strategy of course this is a

00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:18,840
software that should never be created as

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,690
an open-source software because it has

00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:25,740
no business model and it's actually

00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:27,990
using volunteers to survive volunteers

00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:30,510
which are not paid work for the public

00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:33,360
good which is so it is great for them

00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:36,230
but from the business point of view if

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:40,050
something that shouldn't have happened

00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:42,720
if you are in such a situation your only

00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:45,390
bet is to find someone who cares

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:51,420
which is why is the company that

00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:56,910
vanished from the probably asking reason

00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:59,920
we get false of false run companies the

00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:05,649
traveler necessary

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:38,010
the original original software now this

00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:42,429
is a simple others now there are two

00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:43,330
examples I can think of just out of the

00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:50,799
top of my head

00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:54,039
it's Symbian and it's Java for senior

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:57,700
Nokia failed to earn money on it for

00:17:54,039 --> 00:18:00,399
Java not on the Sun failed to make money

00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:02,139
above it but even work fail to make

00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:05,519
enough money out of it

00:18:02,139 --> 00:18:09,279
they have both open source the project

00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:11,649
and now the step away

00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:15,690
this tablet is happy for syndrome and

00:18:11,649 --> 00:18:19,720
I'm waiting to happen for Java is the

00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:21,700
developer we assigned the Java will

00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,620
probably end up as a community

00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:26,200
maintained as a community

00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:29,890
without serious math like that and I

00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:34,270
thought a company like record or maybe

00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:37,179
IBM will contribute to darkness that is

00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:39,640
never God now slightly different

00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:42,940
situation if you would be a cloud

00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:46,059
provider which one is would be more

00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:48,250
important for you software regardless of

00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:52,659
whether it is closed or open source

00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:55,260
software or physical cloud computer

00:18:52,659 --> 00:18:59,980
servers rooms

00:18:55,260 --> 00:19:01,600
internet cables subtitles which after

00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,820
you are a cloud provider this is the

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,149
service units yourself this is something

00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:11,860
that people don't see in the first place

00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:14,169
the answer is for you the most important

00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:18,010
asset is the one the others can't

00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:19,750
replicate right so if this will be open

00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:23,200
source then the computing center is

00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:25,659
important if this would have open source

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,440
competition the computing center is

00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:33,130
important from the physical device and

00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:37,200
this explains why you can see a sudden

00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:40,679
change in the last couple of years here

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:43,090
limbs is doing great

00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:47,049
Microsoft knows there is not a lot of

00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:50,830
money in this pace of operating systems

00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:52,779
and it knows that there is a lot of

00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:56,830
money to be taken from building cloud

00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:59,360
and computing centers so this is not

00:19:56,830 --> 00:20:01,730
absolute well makers of north

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:07,220
and is doing everything to drive the

00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:09,530
cloud adoption actually this wasn't

00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:14,210
always there and the only possible

00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:21,590
Charles because back in 2000 I Facebook

00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:23,870
to create I think it is this product is

00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:34,640
still alive which contains a

00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:37,070
specification of how to be too late now

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:41,710
we are getting too bad we are getting

00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:41,710
back to deliver value to the open source

00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:48,280
this is a scenario very often played by

00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:48,280
amazing

00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:11,870
uses open approach releases its software

00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:15,170
its game engine the overtime money will

00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:17,260
flow to the cloud game engine the open

00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:23,800
game anything will be the only

00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:23,800
dominating engine in the world and

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:33,350
because of open source adoption

00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:39,710
what doesn't leave risks plenty of dead

00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:43,130
other commercial engines possibly with

00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:44,379
their compounds and for amazing it's a

00:21:43,130 --> 00:21:48,979
standard

00:21:44,379 --> 00:21:52,340
it's a significant cloud users and if it

00:21:48,979 --> 00:21:55,009
is a standard this business is protected

00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:58,940
money are forming here a muzzle

00:21:55,009 --> 00:22:01,960
and therefore it in sponsor and

00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:05,570
standards in the change of mood of you

00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:08,659
have learned but we have to preserve

00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:12,109
compatibility this is a very nice

00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:15,259
picture taken in Sweden I don't remember

00:22:12,109 --> 00:22:21,399
when they have attempted to transition

00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:24,019
from one Sunday at noon

00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:37,460
it was a tale that took a number of

00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:39,739
updates and this is the reason why if if

00:22:37,460 --> 00:23:02,720
you manage to establish a standard in

00:22:39,739 --> 00:23:11,899
open source open source that once this

00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:16,429
become major people so who may be super

00:23:11,899 --> 00:23:18,110
summarizes the three important aspects

00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:34,010
successful

00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:40,590
it's contributing to open source

00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:47,660
increased adoption strength because

00:23:40,590 --> 00:24:00,780
there now this scenario is repeatable

00:23:47,660 --> 00:24:04,050
again about amazing or maybe Google what

00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:14,070
will happen what will happen is there

00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:16,650
will be new solutions based on the will

00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:21,630
pick up the best candidate from

00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:25,520
experimental soldiers we leave plenty of

00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:29,100
that the purpose here but will be

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:31,290
so-called power because now making

00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:35,010
customers from the core business will

00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:40,200
require a new competitor to rebuild this

00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:44,870
entire stock which is pretty much at

00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:48,170
some point we will probably sooner that

00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:48,170
government stepping

00:24:50,639 --> 00:24:59,109
no similar scenario was attempted by

00:24:54,369 --> 00:25:00,970
European Union they are allowed access

00:24:59,109 --> 00:25:11,710
to bank accounts I know we are in

00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:26,590
Germany and you're trying to use access

00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:31,090
API not always exist the information the

00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:34,710
problem is the plans don't own the whole

00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:40,359
start so those parts will came up with

00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:43,720
useful software aggregation of multiple

00:25:40,359 --> 00:25:46,440
accounts delivering personal loans when

00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:49,720
you need them will be able to easily

00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,729
other box with quite interesting types

00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:54,009
have made in every related to open

00:25:51,729 --> 00:25:57,820
source besides that the open source

00:25:54,009 --> 00:26:00,700
tundra is used as a way to easily under

00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:02,600
linked providers once we do that you can

00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:06,210
switch provide

00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:08,280
now the thing is the signal of the

00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:11,550
important thing I have to say about the

00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:15,770
pan sauces that open-source Wars if you

00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:20,670
know what you are doing the thing is

00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:24,330
maybe you have open source can clear

00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:28,890
competition in the case shown by Amazon

00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:33,050
or it continued the Copperhead RS is a

00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:40,050
form of Android slightly more secure

00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:43,320
that was released in the beginning yes

00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:46,260
under GPL so they made this business

00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:48,960
model to deliver an open source secure

00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:53,090
system more secure and stuff

00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:56,340
great and people would pay us arises

00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:59,040
what happened is the player competitor

00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:12,060
started saying more seconds they did

00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:14,220
they open sourcing so they went and

00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:28,260
change the license to something less

00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:31,040
permissive and now we can look at other

00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,040
companies

00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:38,010
the

00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:38,010
hit by adversity

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:59,080
this is one of the biggest let's say

00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:02,260
this is one of the thing that I would

00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:08,770
like we've got to be better and this is

00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:12,040
one of the reasons why now cut the

00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:16,030
measures if you are using open source to

00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:18,700
kill someone's business of course there

00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:21,430
are counter measures is intellectual

00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:23,260
property if you are as an open source

00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:25,270
the other party can see you it doesn't

00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:29,170
matter whether the loss with this letter

00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:34,390
is justified or not what it matters the

00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:39,900
device type I don't have to presume that

00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:39,900
a couple of slides earlier we have seen

00:28:39,960 --> 00:29:46,930
on the other hand so if you otherwise of

00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:57,090
the other people are using the operating

00:29:46,930 --> 00:30:01,060
system to craft products

00:29:57,090 --> 00:30:06,810
it creates strategy of Commons it's not

00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:06,810
really responsible maintenance it is

00:30:54,030 --> 00:31:23,590
I do work for a leading edge forum and

00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:25,620
my name is cisco Donna by the way I work

00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:28,110
as a strategic concept

00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:30,750
and if you are too lazy to with all the

00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:33,360
blocks and ultimate realize that I have

00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:36,930
the thoracic course I have a single and

00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:41,060
with this call you will get 50% off so

00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:41,060
