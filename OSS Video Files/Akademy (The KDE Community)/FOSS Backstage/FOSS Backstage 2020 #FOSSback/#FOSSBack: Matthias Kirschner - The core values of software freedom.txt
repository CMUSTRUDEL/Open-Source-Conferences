If you are a Free Software (Open Source Software) developer, do you have to follow an open development model or a certain business model? Do you have to believe in or be a supporter of socialism, capitalism, or liberalism? Do we, when we work for software freedom, have to agree on certain positions on privacy, intelligence services, the military, the climate catastrophe, nuclear power, vaccinations, or animal rights? Or should we accept to have different views or even allow each other not to discuss certain views, because what brings us together are other values?

I will argue that the core values of our movement are that everybody, no matter what background, can use the software for every purpose without discrimination. That everybody is allowed to study how software works. That you are always allowed to share your software with others, either to help other human beings or to make money. And that no individual, organisation or government should be forced to change their behaviour because of the software, but according to our principles, adapt and thereby improve the software for themselves and others.

Furthermore, the talk understands itself as a plea for more respect and diversity in Free Software communities. It will be argued that while sticking to those values we should treat others decently who might have other believes, or another or no opinions at all about a topic we ourselves care about. That we should not try to put an emphasis on our other believes while working together on Free Software/Open Source Software, but instead work together with other groups or movements to bring our other topics forward.

	00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:08,440
so thank you very much for the

00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:11,139
invitation I'm here today to talk with

00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:14,769
you about core values of software

00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:16,960
freedom and before we start with that I

00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:21,430
would like to get a better feeling of

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:24,460
how you feel about certain topics so

00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:29,619
let's get started I will ask you the

00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:41,370
question three first one is okay

00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:45,040
something did not work sorry okay no

00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:48,219
first question who of you hear things

00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,340
that cover your governments military

00:00:48,219 --> 00:01:00,629
should not operate in other countries

00:00:50,340 --> 00:01:03,280
can you show the hands and next question

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:09,130
who here thinks that it should be

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:12,040
mandatory to be vaccinated okay and the

00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:15,130
last question it's a religious question

00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,650
and most people say you shouldn't do

00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:19,869
that in a talk I still want to do it so

00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:24,840
who are few things that Emax is the best

00:01:19,869 --> 00:01:26,799
operating system or editor okay good

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,540
thank you very much for that we will

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,600
come back to some of those questions in

00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:35,380
the talk so when we are talking about

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,750
the core values of software freedom it's

00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:41,470
good to have a look at where this

00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:44,590
movement is coming from and so we are

00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:47,590
going back to the time when your

00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:51,009
computer didn't fit in your pocket but

00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:55,390
you needed some room for that and at

00:01:51,009 --> 00:01:57,850
that time the software which was coming

00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:00,040
with the computers was in source code

00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:02,320
form and you were able to make

00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,820
modifications to that there was no

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,850
restriction what you can do with that

00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:09,130
you you got it you could to make changes

00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:11,470
in most cases you even had to do changes

00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:13,690
to make anything meaningful with it and

00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:15,350
you could pass it on to other colleagues

00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:18,040
in your department

00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:20,930
or pass it on to other researchers and

00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:24,350
that was all possible there was no

00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:26,900
restriction then over the time some

00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:29,360
companies figured out that you can make

00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:33,470
way more money if you restrict how

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,810
software is handled and they introduced

00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:39,650
in the in the software licences

00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:43,310
restrictions on this what people can and

00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:45,200
cannot do with the software and all the

00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:47,780
time those restrictions they got more

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:54,050
and more bothersome to people and at one

00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:58,730
point people decided to make a change

00:02:54,050 --> 00:03:01,160
and fight against this and they said

00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:02,900
that they would like to build an

00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:05,930
operating system the new operating

00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:09,560
system where every component there is

00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:11,870
able to is giving you the rights you had

00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,540
before and for this they had to write

00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:17,030
down what what are those fundamental

00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:20,500
rights you had before those freedoms and

00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:23,330
they came up with in the end four points

00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,910
that everybody should allowed to use the

00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:27,890
software for any purpose that you should

00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:31,190
be allowed to study how the software

00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:34,340
works that you should be allowed to

00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:37,250
share it with others and in the end also

00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:39,770
improve it and make a dot make changes

00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,420
to the software so that's what they

00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:43,790
wrote down in the free software

00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:47,840
definition by the GNU project and the

00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:51,320
efsf and from there on started trying to

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,600
rebuild the whole whole operating system

00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:58,850
where each of those components gives you

00:03:53,600 --> 00:04:01,610
those rights later there are other

00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:04,730
organizations who define that in a

00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:06,800
longer list like here with Debian or the

00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:10,010
open source initiative they define that

00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,540
with ten points I will not go into the

00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:14,030
details of those ten points I will come

00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:16,010
back to some of those I'm never able to

00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,810
remember all those ten points I can

00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:20,639
remember the four points I will stick

00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:23,509
with those at the moment in the talk

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,370
but they define the same thing there and

00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:30,000
just to clarify before when I'm talking

00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:31,919
here about the values of software

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,930
freedom and then I say free software I

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,569
mean the same thing as when people from

00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:40,050
the open source initiative say open

00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:42,900
source or when someone else says floss

00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:48,360
or Foss that's the same thing for me

00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:54,389
it's similar to what is this tell me a

00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:57,210
car anything else a mini some people say

00:04:54,389 --> 00:04:59,849
it's a BMW when it's about a brand some

00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:02,340
people say it's a computer on four

00:04:59,849 --> 00:05:05,029
wheels or several hundred computers on

00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:07,800
four wheels and some say it's a vehicle

00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:10,319
depending on what you say you highlight

00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:12,539
different aspects you will be perceived

00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:15,240
differently it's a little bit a

00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:16,710
different meaning what you transport but

00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,860
in the end people will understand that

00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:21,599
it's about this thing there and that's

00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,129
the same for four there was out of terms

00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:25,110
so when I'm talking here about free

00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:27,990
software I mean the same thing as when

00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:31,139
others say open-source or false of loss

00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:39,300
or Libre software just to clarify that

00:05:31,139 --> 00:05:43,110
before so now over the time these what

00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:45,060
what is this movement about was was

00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:47,129
often questioned or there were

00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:50,900
misunderstandings about that so one of

00:05:47,129 --> 00:05:52,800
the first things which which came up was

00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,680
does it mean

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,099
and in software freedom that you also

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,960
have this value of creative software

00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:03,930
that it should be available for everyone

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,810
without the need of having money to pay

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:08,520
for it and that's something which came

00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,629
up already very early and there were

00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:14,909
several clarifications about that but

00:06:11,629 --> 00:06:18,539
still a word over the time it came up

00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:21,120
repeatedly and also because of the often

00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:22,680
in in the english word free software the

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,729
misunderstanding that it's it's about

00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:30,000
the greatest part this come up regularly

00:06:26,729 --> 00:06:32,219
and we we also see it that people they

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,500
contact us constantly they they tell us

00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:36,660
there is a piece of software out there

00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,860
they claim it's free software but you

00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,890
have to pay for it when you want to

00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,930
download it so they are violating our

00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:44,940
principles they are violating our well

00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:49,950
use that cannot be free software when

00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:52,800
when they charge for it or they they

00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:54,360
also tell you in EPS tours that it's not

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,900
possible that this is free software when

00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:01,020
you when you have to pay for it and

00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:02,640
that's one of the things which in the in

00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:07,230
the free software movement which had to

00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:09,600
be repeated repeated leaved that it's

00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:11,040
absolutely fine to charge for software

00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,140
that's not included in there it's not

00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,710
about that you have to pass on something

00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:18,270
without having to pay for it

00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:20,970
the ever severe on the contrary we

00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:23,540
encourage people to pay for free

00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:27,090
software and that you pay for software

00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:28,710
developers give you more freedom and

00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:31,320
don't restrict you on what you can do

00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:32,760
give more money to those people then to

00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,840
those who restrict what you can

00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:38,720
afterwards do with it

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:41,010
so charging money for free software is

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,570
absolutely fine there's nothing in there

00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:45,000
and it's also something which repeatedly

00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:46,169
in the discussions there was a common

00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,090
misunderstanding in the free software

00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:50,090
community that is okay to do so

00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:58,590
furthermore a lot of people during the

00:07:54,300 --> 00:08:02,660
time believe that free software is equal

00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:05,220
to the perception that people should

00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,810
altogether develop a software everybody

00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,500
should be allowed to participate in

00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:13,229
developing the software this

00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:17,160
understanding came bit from the from

00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:19,020
very very famous projects which had this

00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:21,720
approach so everybody was able to

00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:25,380
participate there and that's why a lot

00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,300
of people during the years they think

00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:30,510
that something cannot be free software

00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,789
or is violating the principles if people

00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:36,240
don't let them participate in their

00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:38,729
project or if people don't want to give

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,440
them the source code at the moment when

00:08:38,729 --> 00:08:43,080
they don't have any relationship with

00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:46,820
each other and then they they say that

00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:51,460
our principles are violated there

00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:55,310
and that's something where the

00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:57,410
development model and what free software

00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:01,250
open-source the support that's not the

00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:04,520
same thing you can develop software in

00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:07,040
your basement sit there ignore everybody

00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:09,380
around you don't take any phone calls

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,640
don't read any emails when you are on

00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,740
the street and someone tells you your

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,350
software should have this feature you

00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:17,830
just ignore that person you can do that

00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:20,630
and then sell this software to someone

00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:22,340
give them the source code or the offer

00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:24,860
to give the source code give them the

00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:27,950
those four rights that's absolutely fine

00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:33,350
to do so you can do that that's still

00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:35,390
free software on the other hand if 50

00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:37,820
universities around the globe are

00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:39,170
developing a software and the students

00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,880
are allowed to participate every

00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:41,930
professor is allowed to participate and

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,630
even the public is allowed to

00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:46,580
participate but they write that you are

00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:49,580
only allowed to use it for academic

00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:52,160
purposes it's violating some of the

00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,720
other principles there it's not free

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,370
software anymore it's proprietary

00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,920
software because not everybody is

00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:59,540
allowed to use it for any purpose but

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,220
it's still a very open development model

00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:05,270
is possible that hundreds of people are

00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:07,220
developing this together on the same

00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:09,590
side it's also possible that this is

00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,360
changing over the time so you have some

00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:13,310
people out there developing free

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,900
software some groups and for some time

00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:17,720
they are listening in a lot to everybody

00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,580
around them and participate in their

00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:23,000
discs in the discussions with with their

00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:24,920
community but then they have a client

00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,600
who wants to have a certain feature or a

00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:29,060
certain product where the software is

00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,860
integrated and then you need to make the

00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:33,350
deadlines and it's possible that during

00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:37,550
that time you don't read the mailing

00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:40,270
lists or forums or don't check your IRC

00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:42,770
channels as you did before and ignore

00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:44,780
other people around you till you made

00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:46,550
this product and it's possible that

00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:48,650
afterwards you see oh that works also

00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:51,020
for me better and you stay with that or

00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:53,720
after some time you go back yet that's

00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:57,710
all possible with free software so the

00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:59,420
development model and the the if

00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:01,610
free software or proprietary software

00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,760
that's not directly related to each

00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,760
other

00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:10,130
beside those misunderstandings which

00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:12,920
occurred over the time and where did the

00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:14,720
free software movement had discussions

00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,120
about that if things are good or bad

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,720
about this and what's what's right or

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,990
wrong

00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,410
there were also then people who said

00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:25,340
that

00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:27,320
I I like that you are able to use study

00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:29,840
share and improve the software there's

00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,930
just one small thing that is missing for

00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:36,800
me that this also covers my ethical

00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:39,050
beliefs one of the very common example

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,320
of one of the very famous examples here

00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:44,570
over the years was that people said the

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,970
military should not be allowed to use

00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:49,640
the software because when I develop

00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:51,950
something I don't want afterwards people

00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:54,470
to use that software to kill others

00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:57,940
that's against my beliefs I don't want

00:11:54,470 --> 00:12:00,920
that to happen and they thought about

00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:04,160
introducing something in the licenses

00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:06,290
where those freedoms I I mentioned

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,940
before to you study and improve software

00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:10,790
but they are written down in software

00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:15,320
and wanted to introduce clauses like

00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:19,840
this to prevent military use now over

00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:23,690
the years this debate was repeated and

00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:25,940
one of the first things which is often

00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:29,330
questioned when introducing something

00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:34,750
like this is you imagine someone who

00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:38,720
wants to kill others and thereby heavily

00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:41,150
do bad things to other people do you

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,670
believe that they will check what is

00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:45,860
written in some license and will adhere

00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:49,070
to what is written there just because

00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:51,800
like Cornelius is writing down please

00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:55,520
don't use don't use my software for for

00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:57,440
military they would all know no I am it

00:12:55,520 --> 00:13:01,280
would be so handy to use that software

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:04,970
now to kill those people and and achieve

00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:08,090
my goals but he wrote that down so let's

00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:09,860
do that let's find 20 programmers who to

00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:11,300
make to write this piece which he

00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:14,690
developed over the last 20

00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:17,089
and and do it do it differently so I

00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:19,640
mean that that's a question which came

00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:22,730
up there how much effect does it really

00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:26,180
have to include something like this the

00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:29,990
the other question which came up is what

00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:32,510
does military use mean do you think

00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:36,430
should should the software be allowed to

00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:40,010
be used in in this in this car vehicle

00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:45,200
computer on wheels should it be allowed

00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:47,300
I mean in many parts around the world

00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:51,800
you attach a machine gun on this and

00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:54,950
that's the tank of the 21st century so

00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:57,649
it's very difficult to to make a

00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:59,240
decision there is are they didn't

00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:01,040
allowed to do that and what about a

00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,990
company who is producing this our date

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,089
and allow to to use the software because

00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:08,060
they are producing the equipment for the

00:14:05,089 --> 00:14:12,529
military it's a very very tough decision

00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:19,490
there so how to define what is military

00:14:12,529 --> 00:14:21,920
use and if you depending on where you

00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:23,089
are coming from where you grow up you

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,329
also have a very different understanding

00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:29,000
of what the military actually is because

00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:31,040
around the world it differs what the

00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,959
responsibilities are so in some

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,079
countries the main responsibility of the

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:39,260
military is to use tanks machine guns

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:42,050
other weapons and defend the country or

00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:44,480
attack a country but there are other

00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:47,600
countries where the military is

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,890
responsible to take care about fires

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:55,130
like you have a large forest fires and

00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:56,959
they do this there or in cases of lots

00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:59,860
and other catastrophes they are in

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:02,300
charge of handling this and helping the

00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:05,240
helping the population to to deal with

00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:10,390
that in some countries it's even there

00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:12,860
there is not that much emergency for for

00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:14,360
when you're insured it's it's an also

00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,700
the military which gets you down from

00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:19,010
the mountains and rescues you so the

00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:21,650
question is then if you prevent military

00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:23,870
usage or in general if you prevent

00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:25,070
certain usage what other usages are you

00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:27,260
thereby preventing

00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:29,540
because you have some third and

00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:32,630
background and some third and thinking

00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:34,910
what what you believe this area is

00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:38,260
covering it might be completely

00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:38,260
different in another part of the world

00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:47,300
one of the other topics that also came

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:51,380
up was that someone wrote a license

00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:54,110
which said that you should not be

00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:57,080
allowed to use the software if you are

00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:59,540
not not vaccinated and as a company you

00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:02,060
are not allowed to use the software if

00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:07,160
you don't make sure that your employees

00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:08,930
are vaccinated because I mean person I

00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:13,340
don't wanted to test some things about

00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:15,800
free software licensing or wanted to had

00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:18,230
a belief about public health and what to

00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:23,000
do there and then wanted to introduce

00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:26,300
this or have others stick to their value

00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,160
system there and there was of the

00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,710
question I mean how much control should

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,630
a programmer have over others how much

00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:36,560
of your own belief system you should you

00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:39,170
be allowed to transfer on others what is

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:41,750
right and what is wrong there most of

00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:43,640
the times so now the free software

00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:46,640
movement always came back that's too

00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:49,910
much we should not allow a programmer to

00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:52,580
have so much power over users what are

00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:55,580
developers and I mean those are not just

00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:59,090
two examples there are many many more so

00:16:55,580 --> 00:17:02,060
there are people have written licenses

00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:03,650
or made suggestions that it should be

00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:06,050
free software but you should not allow

00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:07,730
to use it in nuclear power plants it

00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:12,260
should be free software but it should

00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:15,939
not be allowed to use for people who who

00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:19,250
do animal testing or genetic engineered

00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:22,610
food or in general genetic engineering

00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:24,290
or about certain aspects of label law

00:17:22,610 --> 00:17:26,510
that companies should not be allowed to

00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:29,870
use it if they have a certain amount of

00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:31,460
working hours and no breaks and some of

00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:36,230
them they were even that general that

00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:38,390
they said don't use it for evil purposes

00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:41,179
which is even more complicated than to

00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:43,280
think about what is that depending I

00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:45,470
mean I I would be quite sure that if we

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,240
go through several topics here some of

00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:49,960
you would say it's evil some of you

00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:53,690
would say it could be fine in certain

00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,970
circumstances and a lot of the examples

00:17:53,690 --> 00:18:00,020
here even if we here would agree that

00:17:55,970 --> 00:18:01,780
most of them would be good if they would

00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:05,210
not be done with the software we develop

00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:07,970
think about the most evil person you

00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:09,890
know or you ever encountered and think

00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:13,790
about what might they include in their

00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:15,799
licenses what people they might include

00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:17,690
what use cases they might exclude and

00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:23,450
what they want to force you when you are

00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:25,669
using the software so as much as it is

00:18:23,450 --> 00:18:29,179
under as I can understand that people

00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:32,270
want their their believes to be

00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:34,850
transported in in their work it's it's

00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:39,679
difficult to do that with software

00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:41,150
licensing and it's something where a lot

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,600
of people in the free software

00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:46,640
communities they saw all the time or SS

00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,470
those well use are embedded in the in

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,990
the software licenses the you study

00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:52,669
share and improve it's it's embedded in

00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:54,830
there and they they have to believe that

00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:56,630
it's also true to the licenses that this

00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:59,840
is the case because you saw that you had

00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:02,780
achieved certain things with this for

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:05,570
many this tool of free software

00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:08,150
licensing is bit the hammer and then a

00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:10,880
lot of problems the rest of the problems

00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:14,440
out there they look like nails and you

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:18,770
you try to fix it with that and that's

00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:21,650
often from the power

00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:24,230
not probably the right approach there to

00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:26,540
try to fix everything with with this one

00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:28,270
tool but you should consider if there

00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:31,280
was other beliefs if you can also

00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:33,380
achieve that with changing laws with

00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:36,500
changing social norms influencing the

00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:38,200
markets or changing the architecture and

00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:42,020
other measures how you can regulate

00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:46,640
society in the end after all those

00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:49,550
discussions and and debates over 35

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:51,710
years of the free software movement in

00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:54,350
the end it always came back that yeah

00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:58,160
it's it's really difficult to add other

00:19:54,350 --> 00:20:01,460
things there and at the core it's it's

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:04,190
those mainly those four points or those

00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:06,470
10 points which we defined early on in

00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:11,360
the process and which we wrote down and

00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:13,970
codified by that so to go a bit deeper

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:17,030
into them again Saudi it always came

00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:19,340
back to the belief that anyone should be

00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:21,620
allowed to use the software for any

00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:23,180
purpose without getting permission so

00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,620
there should be no discrimination who

00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,450
should be allowed to use the software

00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,920
and who should not be allowed to use the

00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:31,070
software it's not the programmers

00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:35,030
decision it's everybody is allowed to do

00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:38,300
that and also without any restrictions

00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:40,250
and no negotiation there so you should

00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:42,200
not be have to go to the programmer

00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:44,570
first and ask am I allowed to do this am

00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,940
I allowed to do that that's one of the

00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:49,160
main features with free software all of

00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:53,840
you in here who of you office is a

00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:55,670
lawyer and you lawyer in here okay I can

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,740
tell you even if none of you is a lawyer

00:20:55,670 --> 00:21:00,350
when someone out there is asking you can

00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:02,990
I do this with the software you can say

00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:05,810
yes and you can be so sure that you can

00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:08,750
say yes I'm really sure you can you are

00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:10,970
allowed to do this and am I also allowed

00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:13,310
to do it yes you two are allowed to do

00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:16,220
it but can I do it can I do this with it

00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:18,560
you can say yes yes yes without having

00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:20,630
to study the does license without

00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,190
needing to read the license at all you

00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:25,160
always know that when something is free

00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:27,770
software and it's theirs it's clear that

00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:29,810
it's free software you can do that you

00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:32,180
you don't have to to do the any checks

00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:34,940
there so

00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:37,870
even people who cannot read they know

00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:42,440
they can do anything with it and

00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:44,780
furthermore it's always allowed to

00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:47,630
understand what the software is doing to

00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:49,760
study the source code of the software so

00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:55,100
nobody is restricted what they can learn

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:57,050
how software works around them so the

00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:59,870
free software movement they don't limit

00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:02,600
we don't limit what people can

00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:04,670
understand about technology there you're

00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,800
always allowed to understand that to

00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:08,990
learn from it and to discuss what you

00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,850
found out how software works with the

00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:14,020
rest of society and have a debate is

00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:16,310
this right or wrong in your opinion

00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:19,970
that's something which is always allowed

00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:22,070
with free software and furthermore

00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:27,530
you're always allowed to share it with

00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:29,990
others again so there is no no

00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:32,540
restriction with how many people you can

00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,480
share you can share it publicly without

00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:37,730
getting any money because you want to

00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,340
help people you can also decide well I

00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:43,330
would like to to make a lot of money and

00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:46,250
you you sell the software to others and

00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:49,880
you can I mean you can do that for your

00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:51,500
own benefit or to help others and you

00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,840
never need any permission for that

00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,910
it's not necessary that you ask someone

00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,620
if you are allowed to share it with

00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:59,450
others again you can take a software

00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:01,250
where you paid a lot of money and you

00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:03,530
you know someone who doesn't have a lot

00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:06,710
of money you can just pass it on without

00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:09,560
asking for any money for it that's

00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:11,390
always possible so people should not be

00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:14,450
restricted how they can help others or

00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:17,390
what they can do with 50 with the

00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:19,550
software there and furthermore in the

00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:21,230
world we are born more software more and

00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:23,570
more devices around us and more and more

00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:26,080
processes around us are dominated by by

00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:27,200
software people should not be forced

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,300
neither

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,940
individuals nor organizations nor

00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:34,880
companies nor government's should be

00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:37,040
forced to use the software in a way the

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,770
developer decided them to do and change

00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:41,480
the processes accordingly but you should

00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:44,150
always be allowed to make modifications

00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:45,710
and make the software help you in what

00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:48,350
you want to achieve

00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:50,510
ask others to help you with this so you

00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:53,929
can always adopt the software you're

00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:55,970
always allowed to extend it further if

00:23:53,929 --> 00:23:57,200
you don't agree with the general parts

00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:59,210
of the software you can make your own

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,850
modifications and go complete different

00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:04,570
way from there on and you can make you

00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:07,429
can also get by repair things out there

00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:09,590
so and that's that's always was

00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:12,260
something overall thirty-five five years

00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:18,110
always came back to it that this is the

00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:20,750
common base we can agree on and so I

00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:23,750
mean it's it's an often there's the

00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:25,880
question of okay but free software

00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,230
doesn't solve this problem or free

00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,750
software doesn't solve this other

00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:32,179
problem and that's why it's important

00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:34,429
for us to remember that free software

00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:38,270
and software freedom what what we have

00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:40,549
here it's one tool for one piece of the

00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,990
puzzle so there are many problems out

00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:43,880
there which where you need other things

00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,130
as well to fix it there might be a

00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:48,200
meaning if we stay in technology we can

00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:50,029
talk about open hardware we can talk

00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:53,570
about open data we can talk about

00:24:50,029 --> 00:24:55,549
privacy we can and so on about all

00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:57,620
different aspects and a lot of aspects

00:24:55,549 --> 00:24:59,929
there they are important to achieve

00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:03,110
certain goals in society and have

00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:06,980
certain outcomes so free software and a

00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:10,250
lot of problems people see it's a it's a

00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:15,140
necessity but it's not enough to fix the

00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:17,750
problem and instead of instead of

00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:20,870
thinking about okay what else do we have

00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:24,320
to add to free software to software

00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:27,890
freedom we just think about the old UNIX

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:30,529
philosophy have one tool for one problem

00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:32,090
and don't overload it with all kind of

00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:34,960
other things so that's I think that's

00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:37,309
often good to remember that we have this

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,820
we have software freedom it's fixing a

00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:42,890
few things and it's fixing those good

00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:45,260
but we should consider for other parts

00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:47,059
which we see in society other problems

00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,860
we see if we have to combine it with

00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:53,510
other tools out there in the way we

00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:56,510
think it's it's fitting so there is

00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:58,760
still a very long way ahead of us if we

00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:59,420
want to make sure that software freedom

00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,700
is a

00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:05,210
fold out there there are many many areas

00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:08,120
where software freedom is meanwhile the

00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:10,220
default but there are many areas where

00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:13,700
it's not the case and some areas where

00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:16,520
it was the case before they might at

00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,860
certain points change a little bit and

00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,960
then you again have things where it was

00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:23,000
a common that you could use free

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,070
software for it and and it's it's not

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,300
common anymore and you you have the

00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:29,300
problem that you are confronted with

00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:31,310
proprietary software again and for this

00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:35,870
it's I think it's good to always remind

00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:38,060
ourself about how such changes in

00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:40,640
society are happening also in other

00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:44,590
areas like if we compare it software

00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:47,120
freedom with the freedom of the press we

00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:49,250
people were working for that for

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:53,510
hundreds of years and they were they

00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:57,440
were many several people they had very

00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:59,540
bad effects they had to suffer because

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,490
they were working for that and some many

00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:03,830
people they they died for it and when

00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:04,790
you once have it in society is also

00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:08,840
doesn't stop there you have to

00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:10,940
constantly defend those those rights the

00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,800
freedom of the press and so there they

00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:15,200
are often changes there and even if mean

00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,490
if you go out now and in the world and

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,430
ask people is freedom of the press

00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:21,350
important you have a large maybe yeah

00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:22,850
you have you have many people here in

00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:25,880
Europe many people who say yes that's

00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:28,160
important how much they send up for that

00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,450
is another question and if you take the

00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,590
rest of the world it's a question how

00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:32,240
many people day I will say it's

00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:34,640
important and that they would do

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,280
something about it so and and that's

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,720
something where people were working for

00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,370
hundreds of years already now if you

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:44,270
compare that to software freedom where

00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:46,910
we're working for 35 years it's good to

00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:49,490
put that in a in a perspective there so

00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:54,770
there will be many many more decades to

00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:57,830
come and because of that it's important

00:27:54,770 --> 00:28:00,410
to focus there that you don't get

00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:03,050
distracted from many many other problems

00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:04,910
in our society in this movement and

00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:07,700
think that we should also try to fix

00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:09,980
this and this and this and in the end I

00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,270
believe that if if you try to do

00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,840
something like this and try to fix

00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:14,490
everything at once you

00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:17,909
in the end not achieve any of those

00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:20,640
goals so that's why I think it's

00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:24,270
important that as software freedom

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:26,070
movement to focus focus on those values

00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:29,059
which we which we defined at the

00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:34,710
beginning and which also we came back to

00:28:29,059 --> 00:28:37,470
to to compare that with yeah with one

00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:39,620
own activity of myself I also have some

00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:42,570
other values beside software freedom and

00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:47,460
so I'm active in a Wilderness First Aid

00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:51,120
group and I don't want people to have

00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:52,770
severe injuries or died because of the

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,020
lack of proper preparation when they do

00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:56,960
outdoor activities I think a lot of them

00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:59,490
can be prevented by a good training and

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,529
I'm part of a group of others who also

00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:04,860
things that this is possible and we want

00:29:01,529 --> 00:29:06,570
to achieve that now if I start

00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:09,720
discussing with them about software

00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:11,909
freedom that's a different topic and

00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:14,669
some of them they don't care about that

00:29:11,909 --> 00:29:16,710
some think it's not that important some

00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:20,090
are really huge fans of some proprietary

00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:22,590
software out there and it's sometimes

00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:24,360
bit difficult if you have a belief in

00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:28,080
one area and then you work with people

00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:30,299
on something you also believe in but you

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,370
are sometimes yeah you encounter there

00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:35,940
was those other beliefs where it's it's

00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:39,210
not matching with yours and still I'm

00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:41,730
doing this because I believe that when I

00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:45,210
want to achieve this one goal of mine in

00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:49,679
this case to prevent injuries or deaths

00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:51,000
in outdoor activities I can achieve that

00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:55,020
by working together with a group who

00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:58,649
also believes in this and I will work

00:29:55,020 --> 00:30:02,070
with people like you on the software

00:29:58,649 --> 00:30:03,899
freedom issues that's also I think that

00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:06,390
it's it's difficult in in such a

00:30:03,899 --> 00:30:08,700
movement if you try to have too many

00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:11,190
different things where you have to agree

00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:14,610
on if we take the three questions from

00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:17,970
the beginning and everybody has to agree

00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:20,580
on those how many less people would be

00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:23,820
be in the movement or like now in the

00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:24,830
room if all of them that will be very

00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:27,919
less

00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:31,039
and it's important that we have many

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:33,049
people there so just just to clarify

00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:35,600
this this one point and I talked about

00:30:33,049 --> 00:30:37,549
the values of the movement author of the

00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,210
software freedom movement I don't mean

00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:43,490
that this is equal to the well use

00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:45,049
organizations have in this field so

00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:48,140
there are many organizations who have

00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:49,610
additional values beside that people

00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:52,279
should be allowed to use study share and

00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:54,500
improve software we as fsfe we also have

00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:56,299
other well use there are some of them

00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:59,630
are written down in our Constitution

00:30:56,299 --> 00:31:02,659
some of them are they were important to

00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:04,669
the founders of this or some are through

00:31:02,659 --> 00:31:06,350
the work of people who contribute their

00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:11,299
it's it's friends product it's not

00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:13,789
written down and all of this is in it's

00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:16,269
influencing us and and we have other

00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:18,559
well use there as well but they are not

00:31:16,269 --> 00:31:21,980
we don't have those values because we

00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:23,510
are a free software organization but a

00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:25,370
lot of them rather because we are

00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:27,590
European organization from people

00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:30,649
growing up here in this culture with a

00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:32,500
certain background certain education so

00:31:30,649 --> 00:31:34,940
that that's more influencing this than

00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:38,659
that it's a free software organization

00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:41,990
and I encourage people to think about it

00:31:38,659 --> 00:31:45,289
if when you have a movement and also

00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:47,029
groups how how many believes do people

00:31:45,289 --> 00:31:49,909
have to agree to to work with you on

00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:51,799
this issues and how many of the other

00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:53,889
beliefs can you work with others and

00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:57,710
when do you have to split up

00:31:53,889 --> 00:32:00,590
how large is your group to to make a

00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:03,769
change there and so I I think it's

00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:06,169
important that many many people it's

00:32:03,769 --> 00:32:08,480
it's nests it's necessary that many

00:32:06,169 --> 00:32:11,360
people are working together for software

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,549
freedom around the world if we want to

00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,230
make software freedom of default it's

00:32:13,549 --> 00:32:17,360
not just as here in the room we need to

00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:22,700
have many many people around the world

00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:23,539
who are following us there and SD SD we

00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,000
will grow there

00:32:23,539 --> 00:32:28,309
I mean free software movement already

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,440
crow over the last years by many many

00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:32,630
people many more countries way more

00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:35,360
diverse from from backgrounds from the

00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:37,290
companies of different companies were

00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,060
against us before then

00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:41,460
many governments who didn't care about

00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:45,090
it before and so it's it's growing and

00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:48,410
growing and that's important that this

00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:52,860
is happening but it also means that

00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:56,420
because of this there will be more

00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:59,130
diversity more than we already have now

00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:01,320
so there will be people from countries

00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:02,580
who have completely different education

00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:06,090
than we have a complete different

00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:09,450
cultural background than we have so this

00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:12,480
will also challenge how to be respectful

00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:14,340
to others I mean you see how some of the

00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,220
debates are at the moment happening

00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:20,370
about questions I mentioned before so

00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:22,320
that's something where yeah it you will

00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:25,170
be challenging your beliefs and how to

00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,670
be respectful to others but it's

00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:29,610
important that we that we stay

00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:31,700
respectful and work together with the

00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:33,900
others to achieve our common goal and

00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:37,200
finally the other part which is

00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:38,550
important is that we focus as a free

00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,620
software movement that we don't try to

00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:43,500
fix everything at once but that we focus

00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:46,260
on what this is about what it was

00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:48,390
started for what what you can fix with

00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:51,480
software freedom and focus on those

00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:54,270
parts that you are that we want to

00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:56,940
enable people to use software for any

00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:59,010
purpose to study how it works to share

00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:00,780
it with others and to finally then also

00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:04,440
make improvements and adopt it to your

00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:05,760
needs so yes that's that's it from my

00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,810
side at the moment thank you very much

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,820
and I'm looking forward to have

00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:10,970
discussions with you over the day thank

00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,970
you

00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,179
you

00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:37,190
and questions don't be shy yeah thank

00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:39,200
you for the talk it's great I have a

00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:41,119
question you mentioned there was a point

00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,369
where you had these discussions over and

00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,950
over again about you know not allowing

00:34:43,369 --> 00:34:49,429
military use of software or the use of

00:34:45,950 --> 00:34:51,919
software and was there some turning

00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:53,839
point recently or was there ever at some

00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:56,020
point or does this cover this discussion

00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:58,520
still come up just curious about that

00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:04,160
the discussion is coming up repeatedly

00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:06,530
so I mean that the last point I think

00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:08,450
were worried where there was some in

00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:10,670
Germany now some more discussion was I

00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:13,700
think two years ago also at chaos

00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:16,819
communication congress this topic came

00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:18,470
up it's often I mean when whenever there

00:35:16,819 --> 00:35:21,170
is a military conflict somewhere

00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:23,839
it comes up or when someone finds out

00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:26,599
that the software they they wrote is

00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:29,180
used by the military or by intelligence

00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:33,440
services by the police by border control

00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:35,390
by some of other institutions where

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,220
people don't agree with then it's coming

00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:40,220
up again I mean you also see it now with

00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:42,890
border control you you saw it with

00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:47,569
intelligence services very the software

00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:50,809
was reused in some in some spyware so

00:35:47,569 --> 00:35:54,260
this then comes up regularly and also

00:35:50,809 --> 00:35:54,950
around the globe in different different

00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:58,970
contexts

00:35:54,950 --> 00:36:00,890
and I mean it's it's also a I think it's

00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:05,089
also good that this discussion comes up

00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:08,450
because for for many years programmers

00:36:05,089 --> 00:36:12,140
were not aware about social implications

00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:17,390
of their work and it's important that

00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:19,190
you think about what what what what your

00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:21,049
responsibilities in society is when you

00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:22,970
are writing software and you are

00:36:21,049 --> 00:36:24,530
providing tools and what can be done

00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:26,990
with that you should not just say yeah I

00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:29,570
don't care what what people do with my

00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:31,760
with my software and I

00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:35,420
I can understand that people then try to

00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:37,670
limit this in a software license also I

00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:40,760
don't agree that this is the best way to

00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:43,310
actually achieve that you can you can

00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:46,010
follow your beliefs in this area but

00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:48,890
it's a good thing that that we have more

00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:53,690
discussions about what is good use or

00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:54,680
ethical use of our technology so that's

00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:57,530
that's something which should be

00:36:54,680 --> 00:37:00,340
encouraged and also talk about what can

00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:02,660
you do to prevent this can you already

00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:05,330
write a software in a way that it's very

00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:08,780
difficult to use it for for bad purposes

00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:10,220
in your view or do you agree in your

00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:13,340
community from the beginning and also

00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:16,310
codify that may be how you want to work

00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:20,570
with certain groups out there if you all

00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:22,400
agree that you don't want the military

00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:25,070
to use the tool to kill people with

00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,840
drones maybe it's good that you have

00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:28,370
some common understanding about it and

00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:30,470
don't help them when they ask questions

00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:32,600
when they have back fixes feature

00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:34,490
requests and so on so that it's a good

00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,610
discussion that we that this is this is

00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:36,610
happening

00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:53,870
thanks Matias um question do you perhaps

00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:55,700
see an area where free software will be

00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:58,250
challenged in a sense where you're when

00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:01,100
you do a comparison let's say to freedom

00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:03,110
of the press and then you have say

00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:05,600
WikiLeaks for example where that's being

00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:07,490
challenged and say the US or something

00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:10,510
is there anything that you kind of see

00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:14,750
that could happen with free software and

00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:17,300
legal aspects going forward and you know

00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:19,160
governments per se can't be prosecuted

00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:24,020
on these things but they can make the

00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:26,000
rules so I find that there we haven't

00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:27,800
reached that point but I'm sure our case

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,850
will probably come forward that'll

00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:33,320
challenge free software I mean free

00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:36,730
software was challenged many times

00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:40,850
before they were challenges that that

00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:45,290
companies were challenging is other

00:38:40,850 --> 00:38:47,530
are those licenses valid do certain

00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:49,970
programmers have to write that they can

00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:53,180
they can ask people when you make

00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:54,830
modifications to give back your your

00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:56,390
contributions as a company like with

00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:58,550
copyleft licensing we saw that many

00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:01,640
times that companies were challenging

00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:05,990
that there are there are other

00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:09,590
challenges where people now try also I

00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:13,220
mean that is a copyright is already one

00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:16,160
copy left is already one tool which is

00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:18,140
added there to to prevent those values

00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:23,600
but it's already very only on the

00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:26,390
borderline of how much power developer

00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:29,180
should have over other developers and

00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:32,600
and users and that was something which

00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:35,360
till now was by many is found acceptable

00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:37,130
for some areas but it's it's something

00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:40,280
which is still challenged they're like

00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:43,520
how how how far should that go and they

00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,630
are at the moment licenses which are

00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:48,200
brought up there were people say oh

00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:50,630
that's too much or let me say maybe

00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:52,280
so that's something where ever will be

00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:54,730
definitely challenged and beside that

00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:57,110
you you have other challenges

00:39:54,730 --> 00:40:00,020
technological challenges that things are

00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:01,820
changing from you have your computer

00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:03,980
everything all the software is running

00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:07,160
on the computer - the software is

00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:09,920
running somewhere else or all those

00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:12,320
devices around us have have software in

00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:15,470
there so that's also come often changing

00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:18,410
because that was not what not a

00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:20,420
situation where when these values were

00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:23,320
defined where we are in and so there's

00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:27,110
constant you have to think about how to

00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:32,350
how dispense first with some changes

00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:35,240
there did that answer your question or

00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:38,870
kind of sorta but you know I'm thinking

00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:40,910
like you have for example for in the

00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:45,200
press and a lot of constitutions where

00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:47,330
where is that gonna be with you know

00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,280
when you do have a legal challenge okay

00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:52,100
and and you're talking about rights okay

00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,420
yeah I I think now I understand it

00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,760
better so I

00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:58,220
I mean all freedoms you have in a

00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,809
society they are not absolute and you

00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:01,700
always have to balance them like freedom

00:40:59,809 --> 00:41:03,980
of the press is also balanced by you are

00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:05,750
not allowed to put something in your

00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:08,750
paper which is violating other people's

00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:10,790
right rights other rights we have in our

00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:14,180
society and with software freedom it's

00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:15,530
also something that software license and

00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:17,059
and from the software peace freedom

00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:19,010
perspective you might say you can do

00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:20,960
anything with it but the law will say

00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:22,780
you're not allowed to do this no matter

00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:26,270
if you use software for it or not and

00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:28,400
they might also restrict like what what

00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:30,559
you are allowed to do with certain with

00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,569
certain software and on the other hand

00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:34,730
is it's also possible in the world how

00:41:32,569 --> 00:41:37,460
it's developing at the moment that there

00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:40,490
are also some restrictions that that

00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:42,230
governments will restrict people who

00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:44,000
want to make software proprietary

00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:46,520
because they say it's such an important

00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,260
component in our society it's important

00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:50,960
that people can have a debate if it's if

00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:52,940
this software is sending you to jail or

00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:54,559
not that we have a debate if that rules

00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:57,500
implemented in there are right or wrong

00:41:54,559 --> 00:42:00,349
so it's also possible that there people

00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:00,829
cannot decide is something free software

00:42:00,349 --> 00:42:02,660
or not

00:42:00,829 --> 00:42:04,520
but the government will will say this

00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:06,619
and there will be because of the

00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:09,260
internationality of software development

00:42:06,619 --> 00:42:21,170
there will be many many conflicts ahead

00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:24,020
of us and debates you made a very

00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:27,380
compelling case that licenses are not

00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:30,380
the right tool to enforce ethical use of

00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:33,619
software now I don't think we can ignore

00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:35,660
that it's a problem if software is used

00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:38,299
in a non ethical way and software is

00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:40,069
becoming very dominant so what are your

00:42:38,299 --> 00:42:42,339
thoughts about what would be the right

00:42:40,069 --> 00:42:44,599
tool to enforce an ethical use of

00:42:42,339 --> 00:42:48,619
software or create a better environment

00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:52,960
which makes this more easy something

00:42:48,619 --> 00:42:57,109
that the first thing is that for me

00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:59,690
software freedom is ethical and it's

00:42:57,109 --> 00:43:03,859
it's it's another ethic then some other

00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:06,140
people people's ethics but it's a very

00:43:03,859 --> 00:43:07,279
ethical thing it's actually it was so

00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:09,140
ethical and so

00:43:07,279 --> 00:43:11,709
political when the free-software

00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:14,029
movement started that a few years later

00:43:11,709 --> 00:43:16,309
there was a marketing term which was

00:43:14,029 --> 00:43:18,829
invented to take away those ethical

00:43:16,309 --> 00:43:20,989
beliefs and and rather sell it sell it

00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:23,269
better so the term open source' was

00:43:20,989 --> 00:43:25,549
mainly coined because it was too ethical

00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:26,419
for the venture capitalists in the in

00:43:25,549 --> 00:43:30,049
the Silicon Valley

00:43:26,419 --> 00:43:32,419
so did there is a lot of ethics there

00:43:30,049 --> 00:43:35,439
it's it's just different than some of

00:43:32,419 --> 00:43:37,819
the debates we we have at the moment

00:43:35,439 --> 00:43:40,400
it's difficult to answer that question

00:43:37,819 --> 00:43:42,589
because I think that depending on what

00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,269
problems you are looking at the

00:43:42,589 --> 00:43:47,349
solutions are completely different I

00:43:44,269 --> 00:43:50,809
think I mean there there are there are

00:43:47,349 --> 00:43:52,549
so there are problems out there where

00:43:50,809 --> 00:43:55,099
you need to change laws where you need

00:43:52,549 --> 00:43:58,400
to change international laws you will

00:43:55,099 --> 00:44:01,640
from my perspective not fix the the

00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,679
problem of of these huge monopolies

00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:06,339
which we which we see out there in the

00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:09,469
tech world by creating a new licence you

00:44:06,339 --> 00:44:13,869
you have to think about how how to

00:44:09,469 --> 00:44:16,880
change laws how to regulate markets or

00:44:13,869 --> 00:44:19,519
yeah I mean for for certain problems

00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,689
people see so it's also possible that I

00:44:19,519 --> 00:44:24,380
mean there are other people say it's not

00:44:20,689 --> 00:44:25,729
a problem at all so that is that's the

00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:27,319
thing that there are so many people who

00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:29,059
have so different perceptions of power

00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:31,390
problems that also then does the

00:44:29,059 --> 00:44:34,609
solutions are so different so I mean I

00:44:31,390 --> 00:44:36,140
for me it's always always good to to

00:44:34,609 --> 00:44:38,539
remember those those points which

00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:41,059
Lawrence Lessig was making about how how

00:44:38,539 --> 00:44:43,429
people are regulated you have laws you

00:44:41,059 --> 00:44:45,259
have social norms I mean by by not

00:44:43,429 --> 00:44:46,939
accepting something and making sure that

00:44:45,259 --> 00:44:48,919
a lot of people don't accept certain

00:44:46,939 --> 00:44:50,749
behavior it's also a lot of influence

00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:52,789
you not always have to change the law if

00:44:50,749 --> 00:44:55,839
in a community you have certain

00:44:52,789 --> 00:44:59,359
standards they are not written down but

00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:04,309
but they are still it's it's considered

00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:07,009
impolite to to to not adhere to them

00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:09,049
that's also very powerful tool it takes

00:45:07,009 --> 00:45:10,969
a very long time to change social norms

00:45:09,049 --> 00:45:13,249
often then to change laws but still in

00:45:10,969 --> 00:45:15,890
some smaller groups it's it's it can

00:45:13,249 --> 00:45:17,719
happen faster beside that yes markets I

00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:20,660
mean you you can change markets and you

00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:22,670
also for as I said before even when you

00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:24,559
who spent more money on buying free

00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:27,710
software than you spent on buying

00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:29,359
proprietary software if a lot of people

00:45:27,710 --> 00:45:31,490
are doing this this has an influence and

00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:33,799
the last part which which lesyk always

00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:37,400
mentioned is yeah architecture code I

00:45:33,799 --> 00:45:39,260
mean when as a programmer you decide to

00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,450
write certain software or not to write

00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:43,490
certain software which is then

00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:46,250
influencing what people can do and what

00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:48,380
you empower them to do that that has a

00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:49,690
huge effect if certain software is out

00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:53,089
there

00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:55,069
okay now reminded about iPhone if you

00:45:53,089 --> 00:45:57,650
have software where everybody can can

00:45:55,069 --> 00:46:00,230
just use that to set up a network that's

00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:02,450
making a huge impact on society and you

00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:03,950
you have an effect where it's easy for

00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:06,980
people to do that if on the other hand

00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:07,819
it's it's widely distributed software to

00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:10,640
harm people

00:46:07,819 --> 00:46:12,319
you also have an effect so if the main

00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:15,789
purpose for the software is to harm

00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:18,260
people so I think those those four

00:46:15,789 --> 00:46:19,670
things it's it's always you you have to

00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:22,130
think about that you have to find

00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:24,770
innovative ideas I think with software

00:46:22,130 --> 00:46:27,500
freedom we found an innovative idea in

00:46:24,770 --> 00:46:30,319
one area at that point at that point of

00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:33,200
time and nowadays as I said you have

00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:36,380
problems which are way more complex out

00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:38,900
there in society and software is often

00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:41,240
of one piece of that it's often

00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:43,220
necessary and necessity to solve a

00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:47,059
problem but there are many things around

00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:48,680
that which which also need and where I

00:46:47,059 --> 00:46:50,270
don't want to answer the question what

00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,920
is the right tool for that or not they

00:46:50,270 --> 00:46:55,630
are very more clever people for other

00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:57,859
areas who will have to think about that

00:46:55,630 --> 00:47:06,339
ok we have time for one more question

00:46:57,859 --> 00:47:10,789
over here hi thanks Ann for your talk I

00:47:06,339 --> 00:47:12,710
agree with everything you say just

00:47:10,789 --> 00:47:14,539
because of the discussion which now came

00:47:12,710 --> 00:47:16,279
kind of up I wanted to point out that

00:47:14,539 --> 00:47:18,859
there is something like export control

00:47:16,279 --> 00:47:23,720
laws which a lot of people never think

00:47:18,859 --> 00:47:26,119
about because while open source and the

00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:27,829
licenses allow your everything to do it

00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:29,000
doesn't mean you're allowed to do

00:47:27,829 --> 00:47:31,030
everything you want to do because

00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:33,650
there's still other rights and

00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:36,710
so just for an example there's some

00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:39,560
restrictions on like everything which is

00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:41,120
military or dual use if you're like

00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:44,330
where you are like to share it or to

00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:46,460
publish it so while the license allows

00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:47,960
you to share your stuff was everybody it

00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:49,550
might be that you're not allowed to put

00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:51,290
it somewhere just on the internet

00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:55,430
without any precautions depending on

00:47:51,290 --> 00:47:58,070
what you're doing and so I think there

00:47:55,430 --> 00:48:00,470
are some and this shows that there are

00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:02,480
some ways to find agreements and ethical

00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:04,760
stuff because there's some like

00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:06,140
regarding mass destruction as a weapons

00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,460
of mass destruction stuff that you're

00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:09,050
not allowed to do something like that so

00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:11,810
if somebody heard right open-source

00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:13,100
software about something like that they

00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:14,990
wouldn't be allowed to publish it

00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:20,180
brightly on the internet without getting

00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:22,700
in trouble so I just say there's there's

00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:28,150
already stuff and place might be for the

00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:32,570
really critical stuff but yeah yeah it

00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:34,910
it depends so I I would say I mean first

00:48:32,570 --> 00:48:39,890
yes that the big difference here is that

00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:43,160
with free software it's the question is

00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:45,350
like should a programmer be allowed to

00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:47,510
make such rules for the rest of society

00:48:45,350 --> 00:48:48,890
I mean programmers already in a very

00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:50,690
powerful position because they are

00:48:48,890 --> 00:48:53,090
creating all those tools so should they

00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:55,280
also be allowed to restrict even further

00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:57,620
what people can and cannot do through

00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:59,420
such such rules that that's that's one

00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:01,730
question or should that happen like you

00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:04,940
said like with governments making laws

00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:07,970
like export rules but my aside it

00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:10,040
depends is that's true for for Germany

00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:11,990
that's maybe also true for some other

00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:14,270
countries in Europe but I'm pretty sure

00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:16,190
that there are countries around the

00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:19,880
world where some of the things you

00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:22,880
mentioned nobody will have a problem

00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:24,350
with that and it might become a problem

00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,540
if they see that it has a negative

00:49:24,350 --> 00:49:30,170
effect on them or if they have a problem

00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:32,570
for justifying their power but that's

00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:34,160
that's the thing that nowadays with with

00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:35,810
software freedom the software freedom

00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:38,180
movement it's so large and there are

00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:39,770
people from so many people countries

00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:42,350
around the world and people using

00:49:39,770 --> 00:49:44,720
software where some of the users of the

00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:47,930
software are actually institutions which

00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:50,960
the export law for prohibits you to give

00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:53,150
it to them which many people would say

00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:54,950
it's a good thing but it's not something

00:49:53,150 --> 00:49:59,180
which is regulated by a software freedom

00:49:54,950 --> 00:50:04,070
and so that that's yeah but but very

00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:06,230
good point thank you okay thank you for

00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:11,710
that there was a great talk

00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:11,710
[Applause]

00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,700
