"Open Source takes Product Management to a whole new level -- I had no idea!" said one workshop participant in Poland this Summer. "How on earth do you keep all those stakeholders happy?". He was Senior Product Manager at an $8bn software company.

Uniting design, engineering, and business to produce viable products that customers love is the famously difficult job of Product Managers. Managers of Open Source products however serve not only demanding customers of commercial services, but also a wide range of contributors, packagers, committees, and partners. Our decisions must be fair, transparent, and still ultimately drive revenue. Our Open Source apps are creatively used in scenarios we cannot dream of, yet making usable interfaces requires restricting ourselves to a narrow set of user-stories and personas.

How can Open Source PMs harness wildly diverse userbases, putting their feedback to work improving our software, without diluting product vision and strategy, or losing focus on the bottom line? In this presentation we will explore the unique challenges and opportunities of Open Source Product Management, drawing from the experiences of an Open Source project with 20 years of history.

hello maybe we should make a start thank

00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:15,530
you everybody for your attention so who

00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:21,090
wants to make open source software

00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:22,769
better yes yes say yes if we want to

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,640
make open source software better yes we

00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:26,340
want to make it better

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,670
yes yes we do right and that's what

00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,929
product management is about that's what

00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,940
product management is all about we're

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:34,350
about managing products better to serve

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,420
users needs better and that's what I'm

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:38,010
going to be talking to you about now and

00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,300
I'd like to ask I've already asked a few

00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,410
of you individually but I'd like to ask

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,360
you as a group do we have any

00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,630
professional product managers in the

00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,150
audience I have a director of product

00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:50,820
here one at the back thank you - don't

00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:53,960
be shy any more anybody who has been a

00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,110
product manager of any kind of product

00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,820
excellent

00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:58,020
three more so we have five and I know

00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,760
that we have some people who are

00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,410
completely unfamiliar with product

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,910
management as well in the audience so

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,850
I'm going to try and bridge this chasm

00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:08,310
and introduce you to some principles and

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,630
get on to quite quickly the challenges

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,390
and opportunities that a unique to

00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,179
product management in open source so

00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,340
first off for some of you I might need

00:01:15,179 --> 00:01:18,479
to justify the need for product

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,469
management before we get into the

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:26,520
details because we can expect a lot from

00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:29,249
hackers on their own in situations much

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:33,509
like this they produce wonderful things

00:01:29,249 --> 00:01:36,179
without any managers right great ideas

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:37,679
products even some one or two billion

00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:40,979
dollar open-source companies have come

00:01:37,679 --> 00:01:42,960
out of hackathons and hacker situations

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:45,060
much like this without any management at

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,090
all initially so maybe we need to

00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:50,249
justify the need for management before

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,999
we go further first off I would say

00:01:50,249 --> 00:01:57,600
creating value is difficult very

00:01:53,999 --> 00:02:01,319
difficult in fact and that's partly

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,389
because complexity grows and grows as we

00:02:01,319 --> 00:02:05,009
use more libraries and we deploy to more

00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:06,899
systems and we want to deploy more

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,940
quickly and we want to be able to do

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,400
more more reliably and we want to

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:15,060
automate more complexity increases and

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:16,410
that helps to have a manager overseeing

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,460
things so that we meet

00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:24,090
expectations and also creating value is

00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:26,760
hard because when you build something it

00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:30,900
doesn't mean people will come like these

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:33,660
ghost cities in China circa 2009 2010

00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:36,390
made talk to be occupied by hundreds of

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,620
thousands of people without a market

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,080
because of the financial crash that

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,570
happened before if you build it they

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,160
will not necessarily come and it's

00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:46,500
expensive to build things when people

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,750
don't come and use them and also quite

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,660
disappointing for one's ego and one's

00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,710
team and one supporters so it's nice to

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,050
build something that people actually

00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:59,100
want to use and management helps with

00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:00,990
that too but even when you meet people's

00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,120
demands and you create value up front

00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:05,160
initially you get it right once you get

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,440
a nice launch and a splash and things

00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,660
are going swimmingly well things can

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,000
change quite quickly because people's

00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:14,340
expectations shift depending on what

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,720
other options they have and just because

00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,190
your spiderweb was the most attractive

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,320
option for flies to commit suicide

00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:20,790
yesterday doesn't mean that some bastard

00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,950
won't invent flypaper tomorrow and

00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:25,740
you'll lose all your users so you need

00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:27,810
to stay focused on what people want in

00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,160
order to stay competitive because if you

00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:33,600
don't stay competitive that you're have

00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:36,150
any users additionally assumptions are

00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:38,430
inherent to our thinking as human beings

00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,320
and maybe some of you familiar with this

00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:44,070
cartoon it's very difficult to shift our

00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:46,980
perspectives on a habitual basis to

00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:47,610
perceive what others do from the same

00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,190
source

00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:52,910
input and actually that is something

00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:55,680
that requires skill and experience both

00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:57,750
training and and experience to avoid

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,850
those assumptions because as many of you

00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:02,160
will know assumptions make an ass out of

00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,840
you and me and there's all kinds of

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,489
assumptions built into products I'm

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,170
currently designing a new product myself

00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:09,360
right now and the number of assumptions

00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,709
I'm making is quite terrifying so we

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,050
need a lot of work to avoid these

00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,550
assumptions and having managers who are

00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:17,190
experienced at teasing out the

00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:18,720
hypotheses hidden in the software that

00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,310
we're designing and the way that we're

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,910
deploying and the messaging that we're

00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:27,600
using that is a really critical skill

00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:29,760
and it's a skill among many other skills

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,200
that having a technical background

00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:36,030
necessarily prepare you for very well

00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:39,500
many of us in this room I suspect will

00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:41,640
have spent the bulk of your careers on

00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,250
improving your technical skills becoming

00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,560
technical leaders and in that time that

00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:49,350
you were spending getting to be a

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,840
perfectly clean coder and improving your

00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,610
standards and expectations automating

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,800
everything you may have neglected to be

00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:59,220
developing some of your other skills

00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,690
like user research or compliance that's

00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,720
super exciting right

00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:05,370
culture building important in both open

00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,310
source community projects and command

00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:10,920
company run projects fundraising either

00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,870
from investors or from grants depending

00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,930
on where you're seeking your backing

00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,100
these are things which having a long and

00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,810
successful history as a software

00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,900
engineer it doesn't prepare you for

00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:23,610
actually and as an engineer these other

00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:26,160
skills they can feel like a series of

00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:28,320
traps that you walk into one after

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,790
another like nobody told me I had to be

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,140
great Human Resources just in order to

00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,610
keep my voluntary team together

00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,810
well yeah you kind of do right

00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:35,430
understanding people's needs and

00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,800
predicting them and making sure people

00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:39,390
feel comfortable and avoiding harassment

00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,520
and all sorts of other issues they don't

00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:43,380
come necessarily naturally to people

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,790
who've got technical skills doesn't

00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:49,080
equal project success finally some of

00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,850
you may be smugly thinking well actually

00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,170
you know Sam I do have all those skills

00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,940
I've learned my lessons I've been doing

00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:55,380
it all this time and congratulations to

00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,840
you because that's hell of an

00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,190
achievement if that's your situation you

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,530
still might have trouble convincing

00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:03,300
others to recognize those skills

00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:05,340
particularly others who have a lot of

00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,350
money which you might need to either

00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:09,480
kick off your next project or make it

00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:11,610
sustainable or buy into it as your first

00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,440
users or customers or back you as a

00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:15,210
government agency if you want funding

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,420
support from something like prototype

00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:20,070
fund or others so having people who have

00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:22,560
successfully proved they can build

00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:24,090
products as product managers can be very

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,370
useful for convincing people with

00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:28,020
resources to back you even if you know

00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:31,680
you already have all of those skills

00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:33,450
inside you if we want to build

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,640
world-class products which are

00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:37,890
open-source then there is an argument

00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:40,260
that we should adopt some methodology

00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:42,820
from those global companies which are

00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,290
teaching our children and our friends

00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,540
what it means to be a world-class

00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:49,270
application today and those companies

00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:51,250
all use product managers I was talking

00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:52,900
to one of our audience members from

00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:55,330
elastic and they have lots of product

00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,830
managers many big companies have many

00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,700
many product managers and some of them

00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:59,230
are rock stars

00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,630
sometimes product managers are called

00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:03,130
CEO of product sometimes they have an

00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:05,020
ego to match sometimes they have

00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:06,790
reputation to match but they have a huge

00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:09,130
influence over what the product becomes

00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:11,260
and how well it suits their needs so for

00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:14,380
all these reasons product management I

00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:16,690
think is important to open-source before

00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:18,760
we go any further it's worth converging

00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:21,730
on a definition of a product let's do

00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:24,460
this quite quickly a good or a service

00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:26,770
that most closely meets the requirements

00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:29,290
of a particular market a particular

00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:32,050
market and yields enough profit to

00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:33,730
justify its continued existence I think

00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:36,040
this is a good definition of a product

00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:39,130
if we adapt it to a community-based

00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:41,230
product then we could reword it as a

00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:43,000
good or service that closely meets the

00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:45,610
requirements of a particular user group

00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,040
and yields enough resources to justify

00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,690
its continued existence what's important

00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,790
about this is that products are for

00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:53,710
specific groups of people they're not

00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:55,630
just for everybody and they need to be

00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:58,300
sustained one way or another because

00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:00,730
they consume resources and it's not

00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,140
primarily for you as the person who

00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,580
makes the product we're not just making

00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,740
something for ourselves we're making

00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,450
something for other people and probably

00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:09,130
an awful lot of people because the

00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:11,920
nature of software is that it's

00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:15,250
expensive to make and it scales very

00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:16,810
well so we want to ideally target a lot

00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:20,080
of people with something specifically

00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:22,690
for them and then we have a product but

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,910
that's product in general what about a

00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:29,380
product in software more specifically

00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:31,390
well we can lean on a sage of the past

00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,310
mr. Fred Brooks who wrote an excellent

00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:36,219
book in 1975 called the mythical

00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:39,370
man-month who defined a software product

00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:42,669
as going through four stages with a

00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:44,920
three times multiple between transition

00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:46,450
of each of these stages so often

00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:48,700
open-source starts out as a program

00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:50,590
which we have here top left that's

00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,330
something that works for me it works on

00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:54,480
my laptop you might think of it as being

00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:56,760
a prototype or a

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,560
proof of concept for example and many

00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,060
people look at this and they think this

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,680
is a product this is complete this is

00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,120
ready I'm so happy with this thing it

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,070
scratches my itch I'm going to launch it

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,560
to the world but actually they're a

00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:09,240
factor of 9 away from what other people

00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,670
would consider a product which is

00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,680
something which is not only a proof of

00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,060
concept that works on that environment

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,459
for that person for that person's need

00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:19,350
but actually has interfaces to other

00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:21,199
systems is integrated with other

00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,980
necessary systems is tested is

00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:25,560
generalized so it works in other

00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:28,170
environments is documented and is

00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,820
maintained because a hidden expectation

00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,440
of just about every user of every piece

00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,480
of software ever is that it will

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,889
continue to be improved and maintained

00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,139
in future which is something that

00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:38,699
crowdfunding campaigns often forget when

00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:39,959
they raise enough money to do one thing

00:09:38,699 --> 00:09:41,699
and then don't realize they've just

00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:42,930
raised the expectations of 20,000 people

00:09:41,699 --> 00:09:46,230
that there's going to be a lifetime of

00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:51,980
free updates following and all of this

00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:54,240
makes making a product hard pumped

00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:57,870
anybody not think making a product is

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,069
hard good then you'll be interested in

00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:04,620
why it's especially hard to make

00:09:59,069 --> 00:10:07,410
open-source products making value is our

00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:10,079
goal rather than making features and

00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:11,670
this can be a culture clash when we are

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:15,120
looking at open-source communities

00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:16,410
because when we check on github what the

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,990
health of our favorite open-source

00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:20,699
application is we will be looking at

00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,199
when the last release is and maybe we

00:10:20,699 --> 00:10:24,000
might check the release notes and see

00:10:22,199 --> 00:10:27,060
how many things were in that and that's

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,630
all about measuring output rather than

00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:33,300
measuring outcome and yes it is one way

00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:36,269
of measuring the health of a project or

00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,800
a product but it's not an indicator that

00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:39,120
it's going to meet your needs or be

00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,980
delivering value for you or other people

00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:44,730
so this is one of the first challenges

00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:48,360
that we have the term value isn't widely

00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:50,399
used around community-based open-source

00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,230
products they have other terms which are

00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,300
valuable in other ways but I'm going to

00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:56,699
be talking a lot about value I think

00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,319
this is a very helpful way in to what

00:10:56,699 --> 00:11:01,170
we're going to be discussing and the

00:10:58,319 --> 00:11:04,649
ways that product managers typically

00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:08,279
pursue value with their activities are

00:11:04,649 --> 00:11:10,259
these user research use a story mapping

00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:11,879
prototyping of products sprint

00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:14,449
management or the development cycle

00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:17,069
management acceptance testing and

00:11:14,449 --> 00:11:19,230
metrics monitoring and these are all to

00:11:17,069 --> 00:11:24,089
do with what we call a virtuous feedback

00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:26,490
loop of interviewing testing reporting

00:11:24,089 --> 00:11:30,120
back data and improving which we'll come

00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:31,499
back to in just a few minutes now before

00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,509
I get into more details about the

00:11:31,499 --> 00:11:35,430
different kinds of open-source product

00:11:33,509 --> 00:11:36,990
management we need to recognize that

00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:37,920
different organizations are on a

00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,930
continuum

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,360
some people may object to me putting

00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:44,339
Android and docker on the left but

00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,490
everybody in the room is probably on

00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:49,860
this scale I'd like to ask how many of

00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:51,689
the projects represented here today are

00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:54,600
purely company managed where the

00:11:51,689 --> 00:11:58,379
community has no direct control over

00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,680
releases or priorities show of hands

00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:01,499
please

00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:03,209
everybody has community input okay so

00:12:01,499 --> 00:12:06,720
who's at the other end purely community

00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:08,029
projects where companies they don't have

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,110
to worry about there have to worry about

00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:14,970
commercial entities telling them what to

00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:23,670
do - only - okay what projects are you

00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:25,829
guys from and arc very nice patch is a

00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:27,509
beautiful example of that and so does

00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:28,769
that mean everybody else is a hybrid or

00:12:27,509 --> 00:12:34,740
do we have some people not working an

00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:37,019
open-source sorry okay very good exactly

00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:39,589
gnomes a beautiful example and depending

00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:43,110
on where you are on this spectrum

00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:44,639
different levels of challenge and

00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:46,529
opportunity arise when it comes to

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,269
product management because if you're

00:12:46,529 --> 00:12:50,430
basically operating like a regular

00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:51,929
company that dumps its source code then

00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,429
you don't really have to worry too much

00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:54,959
about the stakeholders because you're

00:12:53,429 --> 00:12:57,660
probably going to be not paying that

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,980
close attention to what they need if

00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,269
you're on the community end then you

00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,050
work completely differently from that

00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:03,089
you can't take the traditional

00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:05,189
autocratic approach and do whatever you

00:13:03,089 --> 00:13:09,420
you know make decisions that purely

00:13:05,189 --> 00:13:11,009
serve your commercial ends right so our

00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,120
first challenge in open source when it

00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:14,790
comes to product management which our

00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:18,329
proprietary alternatives do not face is

00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:21,180
that we have more stakeholders right we

00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:22,860
have a lot more stakeholders off

00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,960
we have the same number of stakeholders

00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:26,940
as typical proprietary software products

00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:29,010
but in addition to that we obviously

00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,300
have a community and the kind of

00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,010
representatives that we have in that

00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,570
community very depending on where we are

00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:35,940
in that spectrum but there's a good

00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:38,940
chance it will include all these people

00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,530
it may even include governance I know

00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:44,790
that we have Libre office here today for

00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:46,490
example they have built in to the legal

00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,690
structure of the organization a

00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:50,970
membership committee and a technical

00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:53,220
steering committee and those additional

00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:55,050
stakeholders which most product managers

00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:58,410
have never even literally dreamed of

00:13:55,050 --> 00:14:00,960
right in thinking about having to

00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:03,180
communicate with and keep onboard a

00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,200
group of other organizations who are

00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,910
third party on a technical steering

00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:09,450
committee world that's another level

00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:11,250
that will shock other community other

00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:13,170
product managers but you might also have

00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,090
a business community around your

00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:17,100
open-source product to which bring all

00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:18,810
their own needs and expectations you

00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,040
might have independent service providers

00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:21,840
people who are building products and

00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,970
companies around the value that you're

00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,020
creating and maybe you care about them

00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,090
and maybe you don't but they have

00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:28,620
expectations maybe you have downstream

00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:30,120
integrators who are taking your product

00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:31,410
and including it in another thing

00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,720
packaging it differently or maybe you

00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:35,550
have downstream Forks like si P who has

00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,900
internal forks of all kinds of

00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,410
open-source applications including

00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,790
tensorflow

00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,260
and everything that happens upstream

00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,430
effects them and they're likely to tell

00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:43,530
you about it if you do something which

00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:46,440
causes them with problems these are

00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:48,600
stakeholders which basically result in

00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:52,200
you having fewer decision making options

00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:55,200
fewer less latitudes you could say to

00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:57,000
make top-down decisions which of course

00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,130
is a good thing because they're feeding

00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,540
you information at the same time but it

00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:02,280
makes it a lot more difficult because in

00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,690
addition to all those other skills that

00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,460
product managers are expected to have

00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,630
the emotional intelligence to keep

00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,880
people happy at all these different

00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:11,310
levels you also have these stakeholders

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,070
who will put additional pressure on you

00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:15,360
quite possibly publicly if you make a

00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:18,750
decision which affects them in a way

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,870
that you didn't anticipate in addition

00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:23,850
to the stakeholders we also have

00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:25,650
transparency we have an a whole nother

00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:29,810
level of transparency to deal with in

00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:33,060
open source primarily prioritization is

00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:35,180
whether it's formal or informal we need

00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:37,970
to communicate as product managers

00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:41,810
what use case we're prioritizing what

00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:43,610
features what timelines and sometimes we

00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:45,290
need if we're working for a company to

00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,790
prioritize things which are unpopular

00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,870
with the open source community and we

00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:50,300
might need to justify and explain

00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,920
ourselves in a way that if we were

00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,900
working in a closed source company again

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,630
we would never have to think about so

00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:59,660
informal prioritization would be when we

00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:02,020
just give more thought more time and

00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:04,940
more energy to pull requests from

00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:08,210
certain representatives or from in

00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:09,950
relating to certain functionality

00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:11,690
whereas formal would be when we're

00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:13,610
saying for example we're not going to

00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:15,050
really release Drupal 8 until this

00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:16,910
feature set is ready because that's a

00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,960
really important set of features for

00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,340
this release and for the people that

00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:21,860
we're trying to impress as an

00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:23,030
organization we have to be transparent

00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,220
about that we also have to be very

00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:27,410
transparent about Authority and

00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:28,310
expectations because there is always a

00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,960
thority and there are always

00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:31,670
expectations when they're not clearly

00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,150
defined they're still there they're just

00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:38,590
ambiguous and causing more confusion

00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:40,700
so governance is one great way of

00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:43,910
clarifying these things in official

00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:46,100
documents but it's amazing how users

00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:49,190
expectations can run riot when you don't

00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:52,190
keep them in check and we need to be

00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:54,110
explicit to avoid upsetting users with

00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:56,440
unrealistic expectations or expectations

00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:59,720
that don't match with with what we have

00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:04,130
we have multi-dimensional quality so

00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:05,810
we're not just gauged our success the

00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:07,760
success of the products we make is not

00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:09,050
solely based on how efficiently that

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,790
product solves the problems it's

00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,080
designed to solve but it also

00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:14,000
incorporates some of these other things

00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,800
we've just mentioned so if we have good

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,630
governance in an open-source project

00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,430
that's considered by many to be one of

00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,960
the aspects of the quality of the

00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:22,400
product which again is not something

00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:25,850
you'd have to think about if you're just

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:28,550
producing a proprietary application yeah

00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:30,050
number of different aspects of quality

00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:33,050
which others don't have to consider and

00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:35,120
again we can expect a public debate when

00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:38,680
we fall short on people's expectations

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,680
of the quality of the product

00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:43,180
of course security is imperative for

00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:45,340
everybody but in open source as many of

00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:47,380
you will be familiar it produces a

00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:49,660
particular set of pressures and

00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:51,460
questions with a new application

00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,170
obviously there's likely to be as many

00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:55,060
people trying to break the code as use

00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:57,070
it and we just have less breathing space

00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:58,870
yes it's a good thing we can't lie it's

00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,100
a good thing that we can't misrepresent

00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:02,560
the hashing and the algorithms that

00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:04,150
we're using but at the same time it puts

00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,410
enormous pressure especially on small

00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:09,160
projects who may not have the resources

00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:10,600
to respond very quickly it's a unique

00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,340
challenge for us and all these things

00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,710
add up to us needing additional

00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:16,690
leadership discipline in the management

00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:17,950
product management field then our

00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,530
counterparts often would in the

00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:23,920
proprietary side because what we do is

00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:26,230
being seen what we are the decisions

00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:29,050
that we're making require us to walk the

00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:31,570
walk not just talk the talk we don't

00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:33,340
have coercive Authority or other forms

00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:35,380
of management authority to lean back on

00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:38,230
and to rely on we've got a bunch of

00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,730
community members and contributors who

00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:42,220
can take their effort elsewhere and

00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:44,530
don't rely on us for their paycheck so

00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:49,090
we really have to practice what we

00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:50,920
preach which is a challenge finally we

00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:52,600
have less data in order to make these

00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:58,770
product management decisions that we

00:18:52,600 --> 00:19:05,800
want to earlier we saw the feedback loop

00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:08,200
here which I've lost but a critical

00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,880
component is data for making the good

00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,280
decisions that we need to as product

00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,530
managers we can't come through this

00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:17,380
virtuous iterative cycle successfully if

00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:18,910
we're not measuring the impact of the

00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:23,670
decisions that we're making and the

00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:23,670
improvements that we're applying so

00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:27,820
validated learning becomes more

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,770
challenging and that's partly because

00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:31,360
our users have a double standard for

00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:32,470
open source products versus the

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,630
proprietary products that they're using

00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:36,400
when it comes to privacy again of course

00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:38,590
we should expect privacy and many people

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,060
like and support open-source products

00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:41,500
specifically because they have more

00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,600
faith in it because the code is public

00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:44,770
but that makes measuring the success of

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,380
what we're doing extremely difficult

00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:49,570
extremely difficult if you go to any

00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,740
startup conference and listen to a talk

00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:52,930
about product management they'll be

00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:55,300
talking about kinds of data data galore

00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:57,070
or you can get it for free there's free

00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,470
startup plans for all these analytics

00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:01,570
platforms all these you know conversion

00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:04,450
automation platforms that we don't have

00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:06,460
access to and we should not our users

00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:08,050
expect very different things from us

00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:10,000
when it comes to the telemetry that we

00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:11,890
collect and the amount of information

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,690
that we build up on them the profiles

00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:16,120
that we have they also don't necessarily

00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:19,870
expect us to grab them for an interview

00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:21,940
in a a JIT sea call or whatsapp call to

00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:23,650
talk about their needs but that's quite

00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,350
normal with product management in the

00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:28,360
private or complete praia teri sector if

00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,250
we do include measurements then they may

00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,900
be removed if we do include measurements

00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,820
then we may damage our brand and

00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:36,820
reminded of gitlab a few months ago

00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:38,830
which slipped a Terms of Service update

00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:41,140
into our mailboxes for these self hosted

00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:42,760
users which seemed all very boring until

00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,830
people realize that it meant they were

00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:47,080
embedding a third-party analytics

00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:48,880
platform within the self hosted version

00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,920
of gitlab which prompted a crisis

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,110
backpedaling and a public apology from

00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,550
the CEO and also months of work being

00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:56,020
reversed and the roadmap for the product

00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:57,940
being changed these things have

00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:59,110
consequences we wouldn't think twice if

00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,400
we were a proprietary company about

00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:02,350
including that because first of all I

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,030
users may not know and second of all

00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:06,580
they probably just wouldn't hold us to

00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:09,640
the same standard all of that means that

00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:12,490
we have less insight into the user

00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:14,560
experience of people with our product we

00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:16,630
don't know what they're enjoying we

00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:20,020
don't know what they're hating they may

00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:21,610
give us feedback via github issues but

00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:23,470
that's different from actually knowing

00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:25,540
how they use it because what people say

00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:27,280
and what people do are very different

00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:29,470
things people don't necessarily have

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,970
insight into what their pain point is or

00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,920
into why they stopped using a product or

00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:34,480
what they felt uneasy about or why it

00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,420
wasn't as competitive as another product

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,880
that kind of information is especially

00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,900
taken from monitoring what people do and

00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,950
seeing what they do in real time and

00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,600
again if we don't have that then we

00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:45,010
can't make those decisions and that

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,050
makes it hard for us to identify the

00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:50,200
value of the products that we're making

00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:51,310
and if we can't identify the value of

00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,520
the products that we're making

00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:56,080
like for example using Miele washing

00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,360
machines in rural China to watch

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,130
potatoes instead of clothes if we can't

00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,840
know what people doing with our products

00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:04,210
that is different from what we expected

00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,590
then we can't improve the experience

00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:08,350
further for those users and weak

00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:10,120
capture the value of those users we

00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:12,010
can't capture any of the value of that

00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:15,039
experience which is important for making

00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:18,429
our product sustainable and resourcing

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:20,890
ourselves to be competitive we also have

00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:23,980
very few open-source tools in this field

00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:26,710
like a bee testing tools analytics tools

00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:28,809
telemetry tools that's one of the

00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:30,970
weakest areas in my experience for open

00:22:28,809 --> 00:22:33,130
source options versus using proprietary

00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:34,240
ones that if it's not open source then

00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:35,919
there's a good chance we won't be able

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,200
to self host and that means not only

00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,880
would we be using proprietary analytics

00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,250
tools but we'd also be sending our users

00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,659
analytics data to the United States to

00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:47,470
come back to us which is doubly

00:22:43,659 --> 00:22:49,330
problematic we also may have culture

00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:53,169
clash right so many open-source projects

00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:56,919
are founded by a single charismatic

00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:59,950
technical leader and technical

00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:02,559
excellence may be the basis of a product

00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:05,799
but it is not a recipe for success for

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:08,110
long term product development technical

00:23:05,799 --> 00:23:12,399
leadership can maintain a focus on

00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:14,620
output again rather than on value and it

00:23:12,399 --> 00:23:16,690
may mean that we end up with other

00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:19,000
companies or even potentially community

00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:21,730
projects which take the code that we're

00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,909
making as an open source community

00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:26,440
oriented projects and do not have the

00:23:24,909 --> 00:23:27,760
same restrictions or the same pressures

00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,730
from their community because they don't

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:32,529
have one so they take what we make use

00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:35,080
traditional closed decision-making

00:23:32,529 --> 00:23:37,899
practices and capture the value that we

00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,070
are not as the open source upstream

00:23:37,899 --> 00:23:41,260
project which is particularly

00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:43,210
challenging and it also means that focus

00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,710
and coherence can be very difficult when

00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:48,340
we have a culture that's focused on

00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:50,679
releases because we need ultimately a

00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:53,200
coherent set of features that work

00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:55,330
together to achieve certain tasks that

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,399
solve particular user needs and when we

00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:59,200
have people making suggestions and

00:23:57,399 --> 00:24:02,770
requests and submitting code and patches

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,659
from also all over the ecosystem from

00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:06,610
all sorts of different use cases it

00:24:04,659 --> 00:24:11,110
makes it difficult to have a product

00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:13,659
which is unified with an interface which

00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:16,390
is well tailored to one specific group

00:24:13,659 --> 00:24:17,590
and one specific set of challenges focus

00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:19,049
and coherence becomes very difficult

00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:21,059
when you're trying to meet the needs of

00:24:19,049 --> 00:24:23,549
everybody because everybody has an

00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:25,679
opinion as kind of contributing however

00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:27,480
having gone through all those challenges

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,399
I can say all of which I've personally

00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,080
felt in different organizations and

00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:33,029
different kinds of products in the past

00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,309
there are advantages that we need to

00:24:33,029 --> 00:24:37,350
recognize and take advantage of so first

00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:38,970
off many open-source projects start out

00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:41,009
by dogfooding scratching the itch it's

00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:42,570
the classic right Eric s Raymond etc

00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:45,149
well if you're scratching your own itch

00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:47,100
then you are scratching an itch it might

00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:48,929
not be everybody's itch but at least one

00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:50,700
itch is being scratched and that's what

00:24:48,929 --> 00:24:52,169
we often call dog fooding which is when

00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:53,879
you eat your own dog food at you test

00:24:52,169 --> 00:24:55,109
your own product and that helps get you

00:24:53,879 --> 00:24:57,600
off the ground and stay focused on

00:24:55,109 --> 00:24:59,489
solving at least one problem our large

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,019
and diverse user base means we get large

00:24:59,489 --> 00:25:02,340
and diverse input which is the flip side

00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:04,320
of some of the challenges I was

00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:06,809
mentioning earlier that means we get

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:09,359
reports from outer space effectively

00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:11,609
running in operating systems and

00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:13,019
environments and hardware and news cases

00:25:11,609 --> 00:25:14,789
which we may never have dreamed of all

00:25:13,019 --> 00:25:17,399
kinds of people seek out open source as

00:25:14,789 --> 00:25:18,929
their first choice which otherwise you

00:25:17,399 --> 00:25:20,369
wouldn't necessarily have heard of in

00:25:18,929 --> 00:25:22,739
different languages and regions and

00:25:20,369 --> 00:25:24,119
contexts which is wonderful in the past

00:25:22,739 --> 00:25:25,799
I've had security reports from

00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:26,999
universities who I had no idea that

00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:28,169
we're using us they're open-source they

00:25:26,999 --> 00:25:30,899
come out of the woodwork and it's great

00:25:28,169 --> 00:25:32,999
we have more eager testers typically

00:25:30,899 --> 00:25:35,789
people who may produce high-quality

00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:37,259
reports they're more expert in their

00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:38,519
field and if we're lucky we get even

00:25:37,259 --> 00:25:39,779
patches although I wouldn't hold your

00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:41,519
breath unless the product is aimed at

00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:43,139
technical users as somebody who's made

00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:44,970
marketing products in the past that are

00:25:43,139 --> 00:25:45,809
open source we had very little patches I

00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:47,999
must say

00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:50,129
additionally we get a lot of feedback it

00:25:47,999 --> 00:25:51,659
is self-selected feedback which can be a

00:25:50,129 --> 00:25:54,269
challenge because it doesn't necessarily

00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:56,039
represent your user base but it's thick

00:25:54,269 --> 00:25:58,320
and fast and you can expect it to

00:25:56,039 --> 00:26:00,239
continue which is great it's cheap to

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,950
sit there and wait for people to test

00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:03,659
your product and use it and tell you how

00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:05,730
it went rather than having to go out or

00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:07,710
pay for research we can't avoid having

00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:09,210
cutting-edge ideas because we have very

00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,919
technical community of open-source

00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:12,450
developers typically and like it or not

00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:14,399
they will pull you into the 21st century

00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:15,840
and make suggestions about how to

00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:17,039
release it better and manage it better

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,230
and automate things better which is

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:21,720
wonderful

00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:23,220
we also are forced into best practice we

00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:25,139
have fear chefs working in a glass

00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:27,149
kitchen and that's how it feels right if

00:26:25,139 --> 00:26:29,460
our product management if our

00:26:27,149 --> 00:26:32,380
prioritization if our decision-making if

00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:34,000
our governance is all in a public sphere

00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:36,250
then we have no choice but to basically

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,520
be at the cutting edge because otherwise

00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:41,680
people will point out that we're not if

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,050
we don't take into account ethics in the

00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,520
our licensing and workplace practices

00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:47,350
people will see it more clearly because

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,260
people tend to be more vocal around our

00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:52,810
projects we may even get very governance

00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:55,030
if we are lucky and we put effort into

00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:56,200
it but we can certainly expect to be

00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,930
held to a very high standard when it

00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,310
comes to data management and privacy and

00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:02,200
that's great we held to a high standard

00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:03,310
it makes us better as individual product

00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,830
managers and it makes our products

00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:07,300
better yeah

00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:09,010
folk ability yeah that's just when I put

00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:10,540
in so one of the upsides is if you don't

00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:12,130
like how your senior management is

00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:13,960
treating you then theoretically you can

00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,920
take the source code and run it in a

00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:18,790
different direction

00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:20,620
coughing x-square cough so when we look

00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:23,380
back at the typical activities of what

00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:25,330
product managers are typically doing in

00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:28,270
any kind of organization these aspects

00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:29,740
of user research prototyping etc then we

00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:31,750
do have open source tools to help us

00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:35,620
with this and some of them are pretty

00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:37,480
good so for the user research side I've

00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,710
used OBS studio for doing recorded

00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,170
interviews you can also use multiple

00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:44,470
cameras there it's very nice see what

00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:47,350
the users doing with your product I know

00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:49,420
that we have usability experts in the

00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:51,040
room who've used similar approaches with

00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:53,680
improving Thunderbird usability and

00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:57,010
others PHP list is nice for sending out

00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:59,070
a lot of emails with invitations to give

00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:01,600
feedback and surveys for example

00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:03,700
customized to different languages etc

00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,250
for user story mapping I got a recommend

00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:07,630
post-its technically I don't know it may

00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:09,100
be debatable if it's open-source but

00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:10,810
paper is actually better for some things

00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:12,310
but we also have a nice app called twine

00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:13,750
eree there's a bunch of other apps here

00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:15,840
I'm not sure how familiar you are with

00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:19,090
them I draw attention to prototyping

00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:21,460
yeah thanks to Elio for reminding me

00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:23,380
about UX box yesterday yeah their work

00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:26,260
in progress UX box in akhira but there's

00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:28,450
some bright stars on the horizon these

00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,860
are both recent applications very modern

00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:32,680
and meeting needs I'd also recommend

00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:34,870
presentator if any of you have used

00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,280
envision it's quite similar in the

00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:37,630
functionality that I need from it very

00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,880
nice very modern

00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:40,930
looks pretty nobody will know the

00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:42,210
difference at least other people I've

00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:44,580
worked with

00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:46,200
and yeah a bunch of other apps we tend

00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:47,820
to use matome a-- for our metrics

00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,310
monitoring it's open source it's got a

00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:51,390
lot of fine-grained control over privacy

00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:53,430
which is super helpful

00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:56,070
they've got proprietary plugins which

00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:59,340
are good for a be testing and monitoring

00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:00,660
specific aspects of the user behavior

00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:03,360
and interaction if your product is

00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:05,040
web-based if your product is app based

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,080
then there's a nice open source

00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:09,180
competitor Touma tomo called countly

00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:11,070
which you can deploy as your own server

00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:13,410
they've got venture capital it's a

00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:16,380
pretty professional product it's yup

00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:19,790
fully open source and geared entirely to

00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:21,990
metrics on on the app front also iOS

00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:23,940
wasabi is pretty nice for a/b testing

00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:26,040
but it's not so well maintained these

00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:29,250
days it's heavy it comes from a big

00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:31,590
American tax firm which I wanted to AP

00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:33,090
test their features but unfortunately

00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:36,140
aside from wasabi I don't know of any

00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:39,390
good a be testing solution that is

00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:40,530
similarly API driven and sprint

00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:42,210
management maybe you're familiar with

00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:43,650
these open project is my favorites got

00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:46,520
burned down chance Kanban and a bunch of

00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:49,500
other things for the backlog grooming

00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:51,990
ultimately we want to make better

00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:54,270
products with open source software we

00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:56,310
want to fulfill our user needs better as

00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:59,100
you all cheered at the beginning we're

00:29:56,310 --> 00:30:01,170
united in that goal product management

00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:03,000
is a critical component to making those

00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:04,980
open source products better to making us

00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,110
competitive to understanding our user

00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:10,170
needs and to delivering the value that

00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:12,000
we need in order to get millions and

00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:13,560
billions of open source users for the

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,530
products that we make rather than

00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:18,330
hundreds or thousands and finally I

00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:20,550
would leave you with this to make out

00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:22,650
comes in four outcomes rather than

00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:24,210
making releases remember that it might

00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:25,440
not be popular amongst your engineers

00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:29,460
but it's something that's critical to

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:32,190
always keep in mind value over output

00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,440
and that's it for me thank you for your

00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:41,339
attention

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:41,339
[Applause]

00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:59,230
anyone in a scrum framework would you

00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:01,330
say that you want besides the PIO that

00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:03,970
should always also be a product manager

00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:07,990
or is it the same what do you think

00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:10,980
about these two roads and in a scrum

00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:13,000
environment I don't think there's any

00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:14,890
universal rule for that like the

00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,090
cultures varied from organization to

00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:18,490
organization it depends on the skills

00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:20,950
you've got and the origin of the team

00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:23,020
but they can certainly work very well

00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:25,300
together complementarity in my

00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:26,680
experience I've had both a manager and a

00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:31,090
product owner in the same team in the

00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:34,090
past but obviously defining roles is

00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:35,830
important and areas of authority I

00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:37,840
actually worked side-by-side as

00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:39,360
basically me as a product owner and

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,530
somebody else as a product owner

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,730
simultaneously in a previous

00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:44,080
organization that worked pretty well for

00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:48,100
a while I like that it's not something

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:50,230
people advocate also my scrum certified

00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:53,680
trainer said that was a bad idea but for

00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:54,970
me it's it was it was okay so yeah I

00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,560
mean also an open source obviously

00:31:54,970 --> 00:31:57,640
community management is very close to

00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,260
what we've been talking about because

00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,780
those stakeholders need to be involved

00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:03,250
and managing their feedback is important

00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:06,100
and difficult as I also heard earlier

00:32:03,250 --> 00:32:08,200
from the audience so in sales agility

00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:10,840
for example a company which makes sweet

00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:12,790
CRM the community manager and the

00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:14,200
product manager are the same which seems

00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:16,060
like a huge amount of responsibility for

00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,940
one person to me but also I think it

00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:20,620
also makes some sense so it depends on

00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:28,540
your strengths too I think is individual

00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:34,120
and what what you like is it the

00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:39,310
inherent role of the product manager to

00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:42,190
impose some some pain to the actual tech

00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:43,969
leads or the the the tech developer

00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:50,209
crowd

00:32:43,969 --> 00:32:55,940
- Wow steer in the right direction that

00:32:50,209 --> 00:32:59,719
well as you said create value or is

00:32:55,940 --> 00:33:04,489
there also painless way possible are

00:32:59,719 --> 00:33:06,619
thinkable that's a great question

00:33:04,489 --> 00:33:10,279
steering doesn't need to be painful if

00:33:06,619 --> 00:33:12,319
you're really good but yeah there's a

00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:14,179
conflict of interest and that's good and

00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:16,729
that's inherent and I think that's

00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:18,169
necessary as well because you expect as

00:33:16,729 --> 00:33:19,279
a as a product manager you expect

00:33:18,169 --> 00:33:21,969
certain things of your technical team

00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:26,539
and they expect certain things of you

00:33:21,969 --> 00:33:28,069
yeah with the the diagram I had earlier

00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:32,899
with the intersection of traditional

00:33:28,069 --> 00:33:36,139
roles I skip past it but it relates to

00:33:32,899 --> 00:33:39,199
this quite directly so we can look at

00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:41,719
the business role like so these are

00:33:39,199 --> 00:33:43,940
different skills or backgrounds you

00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:45,949
would you know typically recruit a

00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:47,269
product manager from the business side

00:33:45,949 --> 00:33:49,459
is like understanding the needs of the

00:33:47,269 --> 00:33:51,259
user understanding you know what the

00:33:49,459 --> 00:33:53,029
market once the tech is about the

00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:54,440
constraints of what's possible what's

00:33:53,029 --> 00:33:56,839
achievable and the UX would be how you

00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:59,809
can package that up in a way that those

00:33:56,839 --> 00:34:01,779
two things match so the constraints

00:33:59,809 --> 00:34:05,809
necessarily conflict with what the

00:34:01,779 --> 00:34:07,579
demand is I would say and so does UX but

00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:10,250
that doesn't need mean that you you need

00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:14,179
to be creating pain but it's also not a

00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:20,919
bad thing if you do I would say they're

00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:20,919
not two contradictory anyone anyone else

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,249
[Music]

00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:35,270
thanks for the talk I'm not sure that

00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:38,960
that's a good question but I was

00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:41,480
wondering in in like the really open in

00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,240
the the open source projects with her

00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:46,880
which have open governance like patchy

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:52,010
projects norm or what you mentioned

00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:53,450
there like how I have you have you

00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:56,240
worked in such environments and how

00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:58,340
would you position yourself as a product

00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,620
manager there because obviously there

00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:03,350
because of the open government small you

00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:05,240
can just enforce your product manager

00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:08,240
rule there so the question is how do you

00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:11,420
how do you communicate to the project

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:13,070
that you should be a product manager how

00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:17,120
do you grieve other product managers in

00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:18,770
the project and yeah how do you convince

00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:20,750
the community of your position there I

00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:21,980
guess a great question and I think

00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,120
there's probably people better qualified

00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,650
to answer than me do we have somebody

00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:32,360
from the Apache foundation or an Apache

00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:35,330
project yeah can you please so I think

00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:38,240
in in some ways there will be companies

00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:40,640
behind successful Apache projects and

00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:42,380
not just one you do get some very small

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,060
ones that are a group of people really

00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:46,400
keen but often there'll be a bunch of

00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:49,220
companies and they'll have direction and

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,980
then as a community the community kind

00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:54,230
of waves up that and says I'll company a

00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:56,840
is really keen on that feature no one

00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:58,160
else is we're gonna let them get go

00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,450
ahead with it but it's not going to slow

00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,220
anything down we're not already can help

00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:02,930
that one over there's three companies

00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:05,270
involved we all think that's really keen

00:36:02,930 --> 00:36:07,100
we've got led a good feedback let's come

00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:09,530
together and then let them drive that a

00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:11,510
bit and so you might say all next

00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:13,670
release manager old Company B is really

00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:15,950
keen their product owner is being really

00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:16,880
helpful and they've been good we're kind

00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:19,430
of going to make them the release

00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,840
manager and let them define done for

00:36:19,430 --> 00:36:22,730
this release and if they're great them

00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,200
will recommend again and if they're

00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:26,300
terrible then we might take it off them

00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,950
or we might just let them do it once but

00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:30,740
as a community you kind of come together

00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:32,510
and say between all of us what do we

00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:35,000
mostly want and who's actually gonna

00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:36,590
step up and do the work that's key you

00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,910
can you can write roadmaps till the cows

00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:39,410
come home but if no one's actually going

00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:42,510
to code against them then

00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:44,340
it's it's a bit pointless so it's it's a

00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:45,960
little bit hurting a little bit people

00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:49,110
stepping up a little bit people being

00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:51,330
permitted to step up but it also doesn't

00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:53,850
happen as quick as a product manager you

00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:56,040
can say by the end of the next scrum

00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:58,080
even if you have to work late we're

00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,100
going to get this feature out with an

00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:02,550
open source community you'd be like

00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:05,280
probably by the end of the next quarter

00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:07,170
as long as no one has too many good

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,470
Network shows we might get this feature

00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:12,540
out but you can't just like deep

00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:14,400
prioritize fixing that critical security

00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:17,520
bug that no one else knows about yet for

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,020
a cycle right things like that but then

00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,120
if you're building your business on top

00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:23,400
of it you might say you know what that

00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,840
release isn't out yet but that feature

00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,490
set is fine so we're gonna take that

00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:28,860
branch and bake that into our commercial

00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:31,290
products but that's you as a company

00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:34,350
saying that's done for us not you as a

00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:36,090
community which takes longer Thanks and

00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:38,250
do we have somebody else from the

00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:40,980
doctoral foundation I'm a member that

00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:44,310
would like to speak to this talk about

00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:59,610
foundation people okay well I won't

00:37:44,310 --> 00:38:03,390
answer on their behalf yeah it was feel

00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:05,730
bad when I make microphone people um so

00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:09,000
I get quite a lot of well a reasonable

00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:11,850
amount of PM's asking me after talking

00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:13,560
about open source design asking about

00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:16,200
where they can go to contribute product

00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:18,570
management in an open source way so

00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:19,980
where is that and I honestly I'm not

00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:21,840
quite sure where best to direct them

00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:24,210
there's a few projects around but do you

00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:25,260
know where best to direct so you're

00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:26,670
asking people who have product

00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:28,950
management experience how they could

00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:31,100
contribute yeah that's a brilliant

00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:31,100
question

00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:38,820
no I don't because it's not something

00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:40,140
you can swoop in on and do without

00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:42,300
really understanding the roots and the

00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:44,130
culture in a project I think but I'm

00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,930
sure if we think harder we can come up

00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:48,650
with a good answer to that so let's talk

00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:48,650
Thanks
