The community is the heart of every open-source project. Without a proper functioning community, the project is bound to have a heart attack, which could be the end: Think of unsatisfied users, project forks, maintainer burnouts, or very annoying arguments.

Building a community can be a daunting task but it doesn't have to be. All it takes is a critical mass of people who have a long-term interest in growing the community. Be it companies or individuals.

As it turns out, this group can systematically foster the community by building a framework for community interaction: writing down guidelines, helping users, onboarding new contributors, etc. The next step is to break out of the daily business through organizing conferences, meetups, or regular face-to-face meetings. Ultimately, the community is held together by relationships which are best strengthened via face time.

In the past years, I've seen two different communities grow: Apache Flink and Apache Beam. Both have found a way to grow their community. I'd like to present and analyze the paths they chose to build the strong communities they have today.

all right so if you want to sit down you

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:13,679
can do that but you can also just stand

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:19,170
and drink coffee no worries so I'm just

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:23,850
gonna start so hello everyone and

00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:25,170
welcome my name is Max and yeah first of

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,440
all I'm really excited to be here today

00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,000
this is a great conference and thank you

00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,809
for the organizers for making it happen

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,580
and thanks for having me so you came to

00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:39,300
my talk about building open source

00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:40,470
communities and I'm assuming you work

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,770
with open source software in your

00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:45,690
company maybe also personally maybe

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:49,500
you're building a business around open

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:52,100
source and maybe you also don't work

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,840
directly inside an open source community

00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:58,620
maybe your developer a strategist

00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,329
decision maker or your sort of owner of

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,630
a project whatever that means we will

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:05,820
see you later so the goal of this talk

00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,770
is to help all of you to better

00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,280
understand what makes an open source

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:14,490
community evaluate different types of

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,850
communities and well to eventually find

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,619
out how to build those communities with

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,469
building a community there's there also

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:25,280
pitfalls and I'll try to point out some

00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:28,950
of those today and also I want to take

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:34,159
at some of the examples of existing

00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:38,969
communities so contrary to its name

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:41,429
which Matias also alluded to and the

00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:45,719
last session and open source is is not

00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:48,299
only about the source or the code it's

00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:51,649
of course about the people and the

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:54,689
community is is made out of people and

00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:57,869
inherently also determines how the code

00:01:54,689 --> 00:02:00,840
develops so for example in a healthy and

00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:05,069
diverse community a constant flow and

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:07,889
exchange of ideas would produce in my in

00:02:05,069 --> 00:02:10,080
my perception much better outcome and a

00:02:07,889 --> 00:02:13,560
project that is proprietary or has a

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,720
disorganized community and the size of

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,560
the community is is not very important

00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,540
of course

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,320
what is what counts is the quality of

00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:24,570
the community the governance in the

00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,480
project is probably the most important

00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:29,850
factor for ensuring that the community

00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,090
works and it pretty much lays the

00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:35,360
foundation for all the processes that

00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:38,940
that have to occur in a project

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:42,120
mediation of conflicts and also growth

00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,770
of the community and yeah communities do

00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,020
not just appear of course they are

00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:49,440
created and that and often very

00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:53,790
systematically so before we dive in a

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,610
few words about myself my name is max

00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:59,760
I'm a software engineer and consultants

00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:03,090
for source technologies and I started

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,750
using open source technologies around 20

00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:09,720
years ago I think that's a long time but

00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:11,820
actually before that first did was just

00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,420
using open source technologies so I

00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:19,770
built my first network router at my

00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:21,900
parents home using using Linux and later

00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:25,080
I started using Firefox and Thunderbird

00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,850
in the early 2000 and I used Linux for a

00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,160
long time on my main computer for more

00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:31,830
than 10 years but obviously you can see

00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:34,620
I want to make now but I still use Linux

00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:37,620
every day in my work so I try to

00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:40,050
contribute as much back as I could but

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:43,080
honestly I all I did in the beginning

00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:44,880
was reporting bugs and I didn't really

00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,820
work on in the community or in the

00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,250
software that much but it was later in

00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:53,270
my studies that I started working on an

00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:56,190
open source project as a developer and

00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:58,890
that was at a Research Institute and I

00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:03,420
was really fascinated by distributed

00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:05,459
systems at the time but our resource

00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,950
project didn't really have any users

00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:09,600
well actually we had some like companies

00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:12,240
using it because they found it on the

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:15,000
internet and played around with it but

00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,370
we we didn't really bother with you know

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,859
they open some issues on the Ariane we

00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:21,330
had our code and Google code and they

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:23,580
made they open some issues and we were

00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:25,080
like this is too much work I mean we

00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,440
would just want to run our experiments

00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,600
and implement our

00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,990
algorism we don't want to want to bother

00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:35,020
with that and so but also I wondered at

00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:38,230
that time you know how does this open

00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:40,360
sauce sauce thing really work like how

00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:42,730
can you actually build a community that

00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:49,170
you know is more than just you know a

00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:51,400
bunch of nerds working on a project so

00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:54,190
after I graduated I had the opportunity

00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:57,730
to work in the company called data

00:04:54,190 --> 00:05:00,240
artisans and it's now called America

00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:02,740
it's a company here in Berlin and

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,390
they're actually we face the problem of

00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:09,010
having a piece of software from research

00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:14,230
that we wanted to build a community

00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:18,940
around and we built it from the ground

00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:22,360
up with like zero users so for me

00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:24,910
personally I always realized that I was

00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,590
I was really I love coding but I also

00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:28,750
and and the process of problem solving

00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:30,570
but I also cared about the community

00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:34,770
because without the community there's

00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:37,480
like no heart in a project and open

00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:41,110
source just doesn't the project just

00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:44,500
doesn't live and most of my experience

00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:47,410
is with apache software but well we also

00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,510
look at they're definitely also other

00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:52,720
valid ways to approach open source

00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:57,310
software and communities so I will also

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:59,910
consider those other approaches so you

00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:02,260
you want to build a community right

00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:05,470
maybe you're frustrated with your

00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:07,270
existing community maybe you think you

00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:10,270
can bet do better maybe you want to

00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:12,160
convince somebody to open source a

00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:13,930
product and believe that building a

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,990
community can be a really valuable thing

00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:22,870
and let me get one thing straight of

00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:25,360
course open source communities are are

00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:27,430
not easy to build there's no like recipe

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,430
a definite recipe for building one

00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:32,169
rather it takes a continuous effort to

00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,270
build one and it doesn't happen

00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:36,039
overnight

00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:37,930
of course the effort might decline once

00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:39,210
the community is more mature but you

00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:41,900
have to you

00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:45,930
have to invest in the community first to

00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:50,669
get something back I think that's that's

00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:52,259
a good attitude you have so the first

00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:54,990
question you should ask yourself when

00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:57,000
you want to engage with community you

00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:00,090
want to build a community you should ask

00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,479
yourself why why do you want to build a

00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:07,710
community right because there are other

00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:10,680
ways to spend your time you don't have

00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:13,380
to you know indulge with communities but

00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,479
I think a really good reason to do is is

00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:17,580
to attract attention to your personal

00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:19,889
self or your company that might seem

00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:23,849
like a very selfish motive for doing

00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:26,130
open source but it's actually like I

00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:27,900
think many projects actually started

00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:30,330
from that people wanting to get more

00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,530
stars on github for example cross github

00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:33,630
is not the only way to publish your

00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:36,830
software but that's what a lot of people

00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:40,530
use and yeah people just wanted to

00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:43,320
establish themselves as as you know

00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:45,780
leaders and attract attention similarly

00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:49,199
also companies have been doing that for

00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:51,539
a while now to build a product or an

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,719
ecosystem around an open-source product

00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:57,389
and a community and companies who do

00:07:54,719 --> 00:08:00,030
that usually benefit from this because

00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:02,940
they have an easier time to recruit

00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:04,080
people because they the open source

00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:06,719
engagement gives them a better

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,460
reputation and also they might be able

00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:11,580
to hire developers already familiar with

00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:13,199
an open-source technology well another

00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,960
reason why you want to do is of course

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:19,169
innovation and ideas due to the rapid

00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:21,990
exchange of ideas you have you have a

00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:23,400
much faster development cycle of

00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:25,440
software usually and if you release

00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,650
often you get feedback constantly so you

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,389
have this feedback loop going on which

00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:35,640
can be really beneficial for source

00:08:30,389 --> 00:08:38,339
software and one one and additional

00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:41,520
reason is that you might also save costs

00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:43,680
right because ideally if you have a

00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,410
function community it basically works

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,320
for you I mean that is if it if it works

00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:52,620
right so you only have to invest a small

00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:57,779
portion in it if it's working too

00:08:52,620 --> 00:09:00,779
get back a lot right but of course it's

00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:02,400
a lot of work first another reason why

00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:04,680
you mind two white want to build

00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:07,410
open-source community is you your

00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,180
forking existing project and to be

00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:13,279
honest that's usually not a very good

00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:16,920
idea because if you split communities

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:19,920
usually it causes some friction and only

00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:22,380
one of the communities will survive but

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,420
and you also offend a lot of people

00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:26,610
usually but they're examples where this

00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:32,339
was really successful like in the case

00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:36,270
for Hudson where you know son got bought

00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:38,400
by Oracle and wanted to control Hudson

00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:40,560
and it was forked into Jenkins and it

00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:43,410
was better overall and do community

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:47,490
moved on so that's a good example for

00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:48,779
example yeah and yeah another another

00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,190
good reason I think is open source is

00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:53,790
fun because you know exchanging ideas

00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:55,890
making new connections just helping

00:09:53,790 --> 00:10:02,839
people as it's a fun way to spend your

00:09:55,890 --> 00:10:08,459
time I think so let's take a look at

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:12,029
what makes a good community I believe a

00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:18,140
good community consists of of basically

00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:20,730
four things so number one is is code and

00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:25,110
you might ask yourself why is the

00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:26,970
community about code right well you have

00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:28,800
to understand that most of the times a

00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:32,490
community is only there because of the

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:35,070
code and a community can only evolve

00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:37,290
around a meaningful piece of software if

00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:39,570
you don't have something exciting to

00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:43,140
share and which doesn't provide value to

00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:44,850
people then yeah how can you build a

00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:47,610
community around this so you should

00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:50,010
think about the existing open source

00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:52,140
projects and and solutions and

00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:56,970
communities and see how you can position

00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:59,490
yourself there otherwise nobody will

00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:01,589
care about your project also code is

00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:04,860
important because it attracts a certain

00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:06,240
type of community so how innovative how

00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,550
easy to use your

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:12,779
where's and which programming language

00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:15,480
you use plays a very big part in about

00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:18,930
what community is going to build to

00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:22,850
evolve around us so for example compare

00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:25,050
a lisp project with a JavaScript project

00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:29,010
compare like system software like a

00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:33,120
database to a web framework or some you

00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:35,399
know utility library the type of code

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,339
has a huge effect and you should ask

00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,990
yourself how how much and how do how

00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:45,060
much do I know the people who could be

00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:47,190
joining my community so the second point

00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:50,670
so first point is called second point is

00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:52,820
people so that's something obvious right

00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:56,730
the community is composed of people and

00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:58,620
if you look at the definition for who's

00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:02,600
like what people are part of a community

00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:07,320
you usually find while they are users

00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:09,270
developers and contributors that's right

00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:12,870
you know from a very abstract point of

00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:16,560
view but in reality things are let's say

00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:19,260
much more complicated so the developers

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,880
they don't they don't go work directly

00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,160
work for the community right instead

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,079
they they work at companies and those

00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,850
companies have like corporate goals they

00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:30,149
might you know shift from time to time

00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:32,040
and you should acknowledge that and even

00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:34,050
if you if they don't work at companies

00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,029
they might do it in their free time or

00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:38,850
volunteering and you should be aware of

00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:41,000
this and and think about that when you

00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:44,370
work with those people in the community

00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:47,160
and for example it's usually not a good

00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:49,140
idea to to rely on a single person to

00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:51,209
maintain a project or a part of your

00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:54,149
project because of that person's on

00:12:51,209 --> 00:12:56,520
vacation or has a burn out which happens

00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:58,560
or just doesn't want to work on the

00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,660
project anymore then usually have a

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:04,440
problem in your community if you if

00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:06,300
you're not prepared for that well not

00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,120
and another aspect of people on the

00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:11,700
project is that there are also decision

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:16,709
makers which which act behind the scenes

00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:19,279
which often like vouch for your software

00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:23,019
and your community in in

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:25,970
in a company or at conferences and you

00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:28,670
if you know those people it's it's very

00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:32,019
valuable for your community and you you

00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:35,420
gain much more reach with your community

00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:37,279
and generally recognizing that

00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:39,860
contributions can be outside the

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:44,329
codomain I think is the key to growing a

00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:47,720
diverse and powerful community and so if

00:13:44,329 --> 00:13:50,980
you if you can cooperate with writers

00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:53,720
bloggers enthusiasts

00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:58,189
influences of some sort that's a great

00:13:53,720 --> 00:14:00,740
way to to grow your community and you

00:13:58,189 --> 00:14:03,529
should really be recognizing those

00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:05,750
contributions also from outside people

00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:11,709
that don't write directly work on the

00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:14,029
code or like our mailing list so I think

00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:16,939
to have a healthy community you really

00:14:14,029 --> 00:14:18,769
need like a whole variety of roads like

00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,990
of course you need programmers but you

00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:22,959
also need architects reviewers leaders

00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:25,939
organizers support has helped us and

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:30,259
moderators and all these roles can be of

00:14:25,939 --> 00:14:33,290
course taken by by Pete like multiple

00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:35,569
roles can be taken by by several people

00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:39,470
and you don't need a person for each of

00:14:35,569 --> 00:14:44,029
those roles but what's crucial to have

00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:47,899
as many roles as possible so we had code

00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:52,670
we had people and the third ingredient

00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:54,500
is our processes so every community

00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:58,189
obviously needs clearly defined

00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:01,519
processes and probably the most

00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:05,120
important aspect of our process is and

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:08,689
how do you contribute to the project how

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:10,939
do changes get reviewed and all even

00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:13,459
more basic how do we communicate with

00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:16,930
each other do we have a code of conduct

00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:19,839
do we have a specific flow how

00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:24,889
contributions are proposed and voted on

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:27,319
and connected to that is how do you earn

00:15:24,889 --> 00:15:28,939
merits so if if you do contribute to

00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:32,600
your project how do people recognize

00:15:28,939 --> 00:15:35,660
your contributions is there some formal

00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:38,630
that you receive or maybe there's not

00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:42,529
even that that's a decision you have to

00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:45,470
make as a community when when you build

00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:46,910
a community hmm and yeah there also

00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:49,519
other things like how often do we

00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:51,860
release software how do we test and

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:55,459
document and also who has the final say

00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:59,240
if if people cannot agree on on a

00:15:55,459 --> 00:16:02,990
particularly subject so we have Co

00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:05,120
people code and processes and the last

00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:08,300
ingredient is are the tools and

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:11,959
infrastructure the tools that a project

00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:15,370
use has has a large impact on how

00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:20,389
communication works right so whether

00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:23,209
whether use email or slack or forum like

00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:25,610
just deciding on where where the source

00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:29,329
of truth is can be very important and

00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:33,620
also like who owns those tools and is

00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:36,699
very important to make sure that the

00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:39,740
project always functions and can't be

00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:41,720
just overruled by a single person if if

00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:43,550
that's the desire so I think a good

00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:47,569
community is one that solves all these

00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:52,189
problems and speaking of ownership of

00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:55,550
infrastructure ownership in a project is

00:16:52,189 --> 00:16:59,180
often associated with the license of the

00:16:55,550 --> 00:17:00,949
code and Matias mentioned already that

00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:04,010
you know software open source software

00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:06,470
has you know different licensing models

00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:09,230
there's you know the more permissive

00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:14,030
license like the Apache License BSD MIT

00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:16,640
there copyleft license like GPL Eclipse

00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:19,939
license and their proprietary issuance

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:23,360
like open core whatever that means or

00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:25,370
any and other custom licenses and of

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,929
course licenses are super important

00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,970
because they set a legal framework and

00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:31,640
also it determines like the mindset of

00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:33,320
the people that are that one to

00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,830
contribute because they might not be

00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,960
comfortable with for example somebody

00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:41,030
not contributing back if if you make

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,460
modifications ellos Mele or distribute

00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:45,230
that modifications so they might you

00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,690
know not like the apache license for

00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:50,750
that reason

00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:55,020
but yeah

00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:57,150
in the end I mean if if you if you want

00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:00,500
to engage in a community of course you

00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:03,750
you have to contribute back upstream and

00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:07,770
you should make that clear to everyone

00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:10,320
who uses your software but that's

00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:15,419
licenses are only one part of a

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:17,640
community and of ownership so I

00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:20,460
mentioned also infrastructure is

00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:24,570
important for the ownership and there's

00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:27,679
also the the name or the trademark so if

00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:29,909
if you want to insure a community can be

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:33,179
independent then you should also think

00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:35,640
about who who owns the name of the

00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:38,700
project because if you know the name

00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:41,789
disappears it's it's harder for a

00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,679
community to like the project can lose

00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:47,789
relevance and harder for communities to

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:49,770
survive and yeah and the last aspect of

00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:52,950
ownership is of course decision-making

00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:55,169
and governance and there are different

00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:59,669
types of models when it comes to that so

00:18:55,169 --> 00:19:02,730
there's like simplifying very very much

00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:05,880
there's basically the ownership model of

00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:07,950
a single person or entity which is often

00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,710
called Pannell event dictator model

00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:13,559
which was pioneered by like lina

00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:16,110
stalwarts and keto van Rossum and Linux

00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:18,210
and Python and their advantages to this

00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:21,120
model and there's a tight control and

00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:23,100
narrow focus so you can you can say no

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,980
really easily which at which your

00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:28,679
project and your community and which

00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,990
helps to say it is to stay for your

00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:33,960
project to stay simple but it might also

00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:37,620
limit how your community can grow in the

00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:39,059
end well for linux and python actually

00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,610
both as models don't exist anymore

00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:44,890
they're now also controlled by a board

00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:49,040
or of you know some more

00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:51,170
foundational model yeah so that's pretty

00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:55,370
much the other model where foundation

00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:58,100
owns well the the infrastructure and you

00:19:55,370 --> 00:20:01,940
know the rights for for a project and

00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:04,070
also its community and that's there that

00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,630
we have the apache software nation the

00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:08,480
pythons affiliation linux foundation

00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:12,860
eclipse foundation and so on and all of

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:15,530
these have different bylaws of course in

00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:18,290
my eyes the the ASF the apache software

00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:22,070
nation is probably the most open in my

00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:24,740
eyes but that's because i know it's a

00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:28,310
bit best what is special there about the

00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:30,170
patches of foundation is that to to to

00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:33,350
gain influence there you you can only

00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:36,530
you have to gain merit also so if you

00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:38,870
contribute to the project you will you

00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:43,220
will receive like respect and eventually

00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:46,220
i get awarded committer ship or pmc role

00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:50,420
and that's pretty much the only way to

00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:52,580
do it other foundations like the linux

00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:54,920
or python variation also have the same

00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:58,700
model but they also allowed any

00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:01,100
companies to to to donate and receive a

00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:04,330
saying in for example the road map which

00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:07,130
is a i mean it's a different model but

00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:09,980
if you build a community you should

00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:12,190
think about which model fits fits you

00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,190
best

00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:19,360
so that brings me to the critical mass i

00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:23,330
believe that every community needs a

00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:25,760
group of people which takes

00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:28,430
responsibility for the project and I

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:32,990
call that the critical mass so what does

00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:35,930
the critical mass do well it's it's it's

00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:38,720
a self motivated group of people with a

00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:40,480
long-term interest and this group builds

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,790
the structures and the foundation for

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,730
for the projects they are also promoting

00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:51,340
the project and they are active in the

00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:53,870
day-to-day business of the project so

00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:55,600
ideally this critical mass is like a

00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:57,980
very diverse group of people with

00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:01,970
destroying interest different back row

00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:05,030
different levels of experience and you

00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:09,110
may ask can't just be done by community

00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:10,940
managers and well not really I would say

00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:13,640
I mean to agree of course community

00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:15,920
managers are super important but the

00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,230
power of the of a critical mass lies in

00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:21,710
its diverse roles and experiences and

00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:23,690
backgrounds so what would be a good

00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:27,110
example of things that a critical mass

00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:29,750
would do well it would take care of the

00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:31,970
project foundation creating bylaws the

00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:34,940
code of conduct it would in day-to-day

00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:37,100
business foster open discussions answer

00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:39,290
questions on the mailing list it would

00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:42,710
ensure that the project stays relevant

00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:46,370
with regards to technology because yeah

00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:48,080
if a project comes obsolete obsolete

00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:51,650
because of you know technical debt and

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:53,570
can't get up keep up with other projects

00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:56,660
then also the community has a hard time

00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:58,910
surviving and yeah it also would ensure

00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:01,910
that you know the infrastructure was

00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:04,370
correctly mediate conflict and it would

00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:08,060
also ensure that it's a continuous flow

00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:10,340
of new contributors joining the project

00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:13,670
such that you know community always dies

00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:17,210
when when other always always you know

00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:21,620
grows when you know other people leave

00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:23,540
the project and another part aspect of

00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:25,720
the critical mass is to have an outreach

00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:28,970
to organize conference and meet and

00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,920
meetups write books or articles promote

00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:34,580
on social media and just be really

00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:40,060
excited about the project so how do you

00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:42,860
find a critical mass right so I think

00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:48,380
there's no definite answer for that but

00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:50,360
um I would say it is a reflection of the

00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:54,220
critical masses is a fraction of like

00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:56,570
how how people interact and projects and

00:23:54,220 --> 00:24:00,620
inside the community and I have a quote

00:23:56,570 --> 00:24:02,900
here from young Lena which

00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:04,429
she also here from Berlin is really

00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:09,039
active in the couch to be a project for

00:24:04,429 --> 00:24:11,659
a long time and he says on his blog I

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,580
try to be involved with every threat on

00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:16,279
the manga list and showing exemplary

00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:17,840
behavior being nice to people taking the

00:24:16,279 --> 00:24:20,330
issue seriously and trying to be helpful

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:23,630
overall after well people stuck around

00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:26,270
not only to answer to ask questions but

00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:29,679
to help with answering as well and to my

00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:32,960
complete delight they mimic my style I

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:35,630
think that's the way to go if you if you

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,580
are active in the community and you look

00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:39,770
out for people and your you have showing

00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:41,630
exemplary behavior you will find you

00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:42,140
will automatically connect with other

00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:45,529
people

00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:47,570
and form this critical mass which is of

00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:52,630
course a very fragile thing and it's

00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:52,630
always a moving sort of a moving target

00:24:53,919 --> 00:25:03,250
so I about you know what makes a

00:25:00,529 --> 00:25:05,870
community what's all great about it but

00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:10,340
you know maybe they're also things that

00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:12,529
can go wrong right this is and an open

00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:14,840
source the lack of funding or a

00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:20,990
monetization can be huge threat to the

00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:23,330
community I mean if you in your

00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:26,120
community you should make sure you don't

00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:29,770
directly depend on the project's success

00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:34,179
or you have a plan B to make money and

00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:39,140
otherwise so you should diversify also

00:25:34,179 --> 00:25:41,029
your income to make sure and that yeah

00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:44,390
you can meet community can survive for

00:25:41,029 --> 00:25:46,279
instance when a classic example is when

00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:48,289
when a company you know runs an open

00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:49,909
source practice it it shifts its goal it

00:25:48,289 --> 00:25:54,860
goes bankrupt then the project just

00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:57,620
disappears and yeah you should encourage

00:25:54,860 --> 00:26:01,360
actively to diversification in your

00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:04,159
project otherwise your project might die

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:07,490
another thing is unsatisfied users and

00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:09,020
contributors things might break and

00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:11,910
don't get fixed and if you don't have

00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:15,270
the right process in place

00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:18,180
then you know bad documentation

00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:21,810
complexity generally unfriendliness

00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:25,080
tyrannous might just result in your

00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:28,170
project to become obsolescence similarly

00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:31,050
also if you are unfriendly to people or

00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:36,120
you lack diversity that might you know

00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:38,280
hurt your project also connected to that

00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,990
is you know just people burning out if

00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,910
the project scales because they can't

00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:45,960
handle the stress that's huge

00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:47,940
shoots threat to the community and yeah

00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:52,320
so you should play fair and moderate

00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:54,960
discussions and ensure that you know the

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,300
burden is not only on a few people on

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,730
the project so everybody give something

00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:02,550
and receive something if you don't do

00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:07,080
that your your project might get forked

00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:09,030
it might just end up being dead and that

00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:11,880
might damage your reputation as a

00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:14,970
company or an hour person and result in

00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:18,270
a lot of costs which you maybe not

00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:21,930
obvious um

00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:25,500
so perhaps before doing something that

00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:31,490
could harm you maybe you should see a

00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:36,120
talk on building a community first so I

00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:39,990
want to conclude with looking at two

00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:41,760
projects here one is called Apache beam

00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:45,270
and patchy and the other one is called

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:48,450
Apache Frank they're both Apache

00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:52,410
projects as you can see and I think

00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:56,970
they're a great example of how to grow a

00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:59,970
community although I want to hear matías

00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:04,020
opinion maybe on this because definitely

00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:09,330
these this project had a lot of let's

00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:10,950
say investment the backing them so it

00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:13,230
was maybe easier for them to grow

00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:16,500
community but I believe the success of

00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:18,270
this project for example flink is is

00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:21,500
really due to the investment in the

00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:24,560
community which is not something that

00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:26,990
you can just do with money

00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:29,840
so flink is a stream processing system

00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:32,890
open source which definitely has a

00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:35,420
really innovative technology which

00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:39,020
helped it to also grow a community

00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:42,470
around it but I was working in this

00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:44,660
company here in Berlin which helped to

00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:47,270
grow the community and I think what we

00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:50,600
did there was really we stopped

00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:52,610
communicating in the company internally

00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:55,900
about what how we would develop the

00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:58,490
software instead we would do all our

00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,500
communication on the mailing list we

00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:03,740
would share design documents online

00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:07,910
start discussions we would we understood

00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:10,220
that it would you know just harm the

00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:14,480
community if we communicate communicated

00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:16,160
secretly and of course maybe that's not

00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,920
possible with all regards of your

00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:20,690
company's business but we pretty much

00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:23,180
shared everything and also we organized

00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:26,990
meetups and a conference called fling

00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:29,660
forward from 2015 on which helped to

00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:32,390
build a community it the community

00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:35,420
expanded like so much it went into China

00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:37,040
and in 2016 we're like there are no

00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:39,650
conferences with like thousands of

00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:42,950
people bigger than in Europe or the US

00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:46,460
and yeah I think that's just a great

00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:48,500
example of how to grow community another

00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:51,800
project that I worked in was Apache beam

00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:53,150
and it's also a good example how joining

00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,770
a foundation the Apache Software

00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:57,560
Foundation can really help a project

00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:59,780
because it was a sort of a github

00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:02,180
repository in the beginning Google

00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:04,490
Google open sourced it but you know

00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:07,310
there was no not even clear contribution

00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:10,010
guidelines there was not really much

00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:11,750
going on with the project so what Google

00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:17,870
did is they donated it to the Apache

00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:19,610
Software Foundation and they they Google

00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:22,550
and also the rest of community which

00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:23,900
developed really made sure that you know

00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:28,550
it had really clear contribution

00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:31,670
guidelines and actually we grew the

00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:34,190
community there because we are actively

00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:36,770
observed everyone who was involved with

00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:38,090
the project everyone who posted the

00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:40,370
email

00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:43,940
contribute on github we took note of

00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:46,580
that of that person and we encouraged

00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:49,789
them through emails and interaction to

00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:51,830
stay involved with our projects and that

00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:56,450
that way we were able to grow the

00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:59,659
community every month by several I don't

00:30:56,450 --> 00:31:00,919
know the exact numbers but we all like I

00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:03,580
would say we had we added like a

00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:04,929
committer like at least every month and

00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:07,730
[Music]

00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:09,860
yeah and and also we explicitly

00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:12,200
acknowledged that non-code contribution

00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:15,890
would be also OK for committee ships

00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:19,250
ships which i think at that time was

00:31:15,890 --> 00:31:21,230
still a new idea and some people were a

00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:25,220
bit opposed a bit about it in the

00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:29,210
beginning yeah also we organize

00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:30,710
conferences and meetups which yeah

00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:32,899
especially conference we only started

00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:39,649
recently but that also helped to grow

00:31:32,899 --> 00:31:41,299
the community so to conclude building

00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:44,090
and fostering a community is definitely

00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:47,840
not an easy task and it can take years

00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:51,950
to build a healthy community there is no

00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:54,350
easy way I think that's clear but to

00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:59,659
give I wanted to you know state four

00:31:54,350 --> 00:32:07,130
things in the end to sort of summarize

00:31:59,659 --> 00:32:12,140
this so I think the four axioms I don't

00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:15,620
know for a strong community are yeah if

00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:19,029
you could communicate openly to share

00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:23,929
your intentions to make sure that

00:32:19,029 --> 00:32:28,039
nothing is you know happening behind the

00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:30,710
scenes and everything that is happening

00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:33,529
a project should be documented every

00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:35,779
process how to do things should have a

00:32:33,529 --> 00:32:38,169
clear place so that somebody who joins

00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:40,850
it has an easy time to figure out things

00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:43,100
then another point is innovation is

00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:46,549
super-important I think if you don't

00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:49,190
think about how you your software can

00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:51,200
innovate and adapt to well the market

00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:52,850
and also people's need

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:56,900
then I think you're doing it wrong and

00:32:52,850 --> 00:33:00,710
you yeah your community will not last

00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:02,900
very long and yeah I mentioned

00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:04,820
recruiting like looking out for new

00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:06,980
people that's super important because

00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:10,280
you never know how long somebody sticks

00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:13,730
around because of you know things that

00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:15,470
change in life and or you know maybe

00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:17,380
that person doesn't want to work on the

00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:21,170
project anymore because it's just fed up

00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:23,300
you know changing jobs is to see so you

00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:27,070
should you should make sure that you

00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:30,500
keep a healthy line of new people always

00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:34,070
in place and yeah and then also of

00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:37,040
course foster relationships via kind

00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:40,340
communication code of conduct

00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:43,700
conferences meetups on that's the only

00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:48,230
way to you know keep like bring people

00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:50,330
together and more closely so with a

00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:55,340
critical mass you can build a foundation

00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:57,170
for your community and yeah the critical

00:33:55,340 --> 00:34:02,140
mass might be really small to begin with

00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:04,820
but keep an eye on new members and

00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:07,670
remember that relationships are at the

00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:10,010
core of a strong community so with that

00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,960
I want to complete conclude thank you

00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,800
very much for listening

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:17,570
[Music]

00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:20,730
[Applause]

00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:25,360
UMAX for that great talk does anyone

00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:28,439
have any questions we have one here

00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:28,439
[Music]

00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:35,550
thanks for the talk

00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:37,920
my question is if a project starts

00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:39,420
within a company and first the company

00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,670
is just using it internally and now

00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:44,880
you're considering to make it public

00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:47,760
open sources like can you test the

00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:50,250
waters like can I even gain critical

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,750
mass outside of my company before you do

00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:54,570
it because otherwise you just have

00:34:51,750 --> 00:35:04,520
another potentially dead project out

00:34:54,570 --> 00:35:10,830
there that's not an easy question I

00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:13,740
think yes you can you can test you can

00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:16,950
test how you know the potential that

00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:18,740
your open source project you know has

00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:23,280
for in terms of building a community

00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:24,900
because I mean chances are if you if you

00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,510
think about all these things that I've

00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:30,360
pointed out and you you really shift

00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:32,880
your focus from development inside to

00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:34,860
being very open transparently and you

00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,860
you build something that people you know

00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:39,240
actually need not something as just some

00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:42,120
old piece of software that you don't

00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:44,100
want to maintain anymore I think then

00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:46,410
you're pretty much guaranteed that there

00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:50,340
will be a community around us but of

00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:52,680
course you know yeah there's no

00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:55,890
guarantee for it and you it might take a

00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:59,820
while to pick up what I think one thing

00:35:55,890 --> 00:36:02,670
that you probably can do is you know

00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:04,740
just promote that project reach out to

00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:10,020
customers or people already involved

00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:11,730
with your existing with the solution

00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:14,190
that you might be providing to people

00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:16,980
and encourage them to take a look at the

00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:20,220
project and point out to them that they

00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:21,390
might benefit also from engaging in the

00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:24,540
community

00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:33,730
[Music]

00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:37,030
any more questions thanks for your talks

00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:38,830
very interesting learned a lot

00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:42,100
I'm Benedict I'm actually an account

00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:45,370
economist so this is quite new to me but

00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:47,590
very very good to know I'd like to start

00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:51,640
with a question and then a bunch of

00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:53,380
comments so yeah I'm interested in this

00:36:51,640 --> 00:37:01,480
because open source becomes also very

00:36:53,380 --> 00:37:03,040
relevant in hardware and we we see is so

00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:09,340
it becomes more powerful and what we see

00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:11,830
is that it's mostly free market dynamics

00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:15,490
I would say so my I'm really interested

00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:18,220
in how the state can kind of regulate it

00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:21,730
not by law but how can you actively

00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:25,300
engage in open source communities and

00:37:21,730 --> 00:37:30,370
thereby maybe ensure that what happens

00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:32,320
is kind of within democratic values so

00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:35,830
my question would be do you have any

00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:39,610
examples of state actors engaging in

00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:42,510
open source communities and then yeah

00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:42,510
maybe I stopped here

00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:50,950
yeah that's that's an interesting

00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:55,240
question I think that is sort of related

00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:57,820
to Matias talk as well how you know how

00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,800
an open source so I understand correctly

00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:07,230
you're saying how should an open source

00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:10,060
project act towards you know government

00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:12,090
actors right who who are active in the

00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:12,090
community

00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:26,620
oh I think well I mean that's happening

00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:29,890
already I mean in Germany there are fans

00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:31,870
who you know research projects and funds

00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:34,000
that you know directly benefit open

00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:36,250
source technologies and or even like

00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,860
build no new yorking source technologies

00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:42,100
of course how much the community is part

00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:44,380
of that process I am not exactly one of

00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:46,480
us in sure because sometimes it's only

00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:48,130
you know about building something that

00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,020
is open source and you know rest doesn't

00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:54,460
matter in terms of fulfilling the

00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:57,270
research contract there but yeah

00:38:54,460 --> 00:39:00,100
actually to answer your question about

00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:04,390
actors state actress and open source we

00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:06,790
actually had you know in in Apache Fling

00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:10,330
we had an interesting case for example

00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:14,710
because it's it's a streaming technology

00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:18,580
for big data or you know data in general

00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:20,920
so we had actually also somebody who you

00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:23,200
know had really did great contributions

00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,900
in the project template code and

00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:28,210
community but we found out you know or

00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:29,290
we weren't really sure you know we

00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:31,330
didn't want to ask like where this

00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:32,650
person actually work and it turned out

00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:38,140
probably that person was actually

00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:40,720
working for the NSA which kind of let us

00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:42,940
question like is that you know okay use

00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:46,740
of our software do we you want do we

00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:50,140
want to support that how do we you know

00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:51,940
how do we engage with that person if we

00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:55,380
know that and I personally think that

00:39:51,940 --> 00:40:00,400
you should probably decouple that from I

00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:02,110
mean it's hard but I mean if you if you

00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,760
if you keep ask if you asked you know

00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:05,710
what why are you doing this why are you

00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:09,340
contributing this you can always you

00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:12,220
know go deeper and question the motives

00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:14,620
for a person to engage in a community

00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:16,540
but I think you as a community you gain

00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:18,520
more if you don't ask this question but

00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:20,830
you don't you only see you know what

00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:26,260
that person is doing good for the for

00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:28,900
the project and I think

00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:33,670
and I think also that is goes

00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:36,460
interaction of what Matthias said maybe

00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:39,160
disagrees I don't know and yeah asking

00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:41,800
that you know you know asking where it

00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:44,290
you know what other motifs is is usually

00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:46,570
not the most helpful question but of

00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:50,650
course if that person was to you know

00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:51,100
act in a non friendly way or would you

00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:53,800
harm

00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:55,060
you know actively the project and you

00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:59,020
would have to do something against that

00:40:55,060 --> 00:41:01,510
speak out of course I which doesn't mean

00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:04,210
like for example I would incur to size

00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:05,440
the NSA or so but I mean you know that's

00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:07,090
two different things

00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,890
you know what my political opinion is

00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:17,619
and you know what is good for a

00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:21,640
community I believe just as a very small

00:41:17,619 --> 00:41:23,560
addition you can you can check join up

00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,810
which is a European from the European

00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,490
Commission website where they publish

00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:30,700
case studies of government involvement

00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:32,770
in free software projects there is also

00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:35,260
the sharing and reuse award from the

00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:36,940
European Commission where they give

00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:39,730
awards to public administration who

00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:42,520
actively start own projects and put it

00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:44,200
under free software licenses and the

00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:47,080
other question was also the like

00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:49,150
involvement in foundations flow yarn

00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:50,710
over there there was also public

00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:52,900
administration involved in the document

00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:55,359
foundation projects there so that that's

00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:57,910
happening a lot and those resources is

00:41:55,359 --> 00:42:00,340
something good to look at and there's a

00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:02,619
small advertisement we also have a Pro

00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:04,990
sure with examples of government usage

00:42:02,619 --> 00:42:08,260
of free software it's a public money

00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:10,840
public code on public code you you can

00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:13,119
order the brochure or say I have a look

00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:17,080
at the PDF version there and there are

00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:18,970
also some examples in there and another

00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:21,070
just two other cases I wanted to point

00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:21,820
out so with the NSA there was recently a

00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:24,310
CVE

00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:26,200
they announced right so they're actively

00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:27,550
part of the community in a sense when

00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:30,220
they do something like that but

00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:32,770
obviously they they did that because

00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:35,470
their systems were at risk probably the

00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:38,020
other thing is in Italy there's also a

00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:39,730
group that's open-source software they

00:42:38,020 --> 00:42:43,210
coordinate

00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:46,599
the entire Italian government like open

00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:49,210
source projects and there's a talk yet

00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:53,349
digital innovation unit and they gave a

00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:57,579
talk at KDE Academy this past year which

00:42:53,349 --> 00:43:01,780
was really interesting here yeah we have

00:42:57,579 --> 00:43:04,720
time for one more question okay quick

00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:06,550
question since the term critical mass

00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,200
kind of implies that there's a lower

00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:10,780
bound to how many people you knew it can

00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:12,970
you put a number on that like what's the

00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:18,160
amount of people you'd need to get it

00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:21,240
started yeah I would say this is one

00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:25,060
person and you need at least one person

00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:28,510
either or maybe in the future there will

00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:31,570
be you know AI machine learning

00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:34,630
algorithms that bootstrap the community

00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:36,760
but you need one person I believe and

00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:38,500
that's that's very often the how things

00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:41,560
start actually some person kicking it

00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:46,089
often really standing or making a

00:43:41,560 --> 00:44:16,869
statement for the project we have time

00:43:46,089 --> 00:44:18,670
for one quick one okay thank you thanks

00:44:16,869 --> 00:44:21,150
very much for that and thank you we'll

00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:21,420
take a 20-minute break for coffee

00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:24,590
[Applause]

00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:24,590
[Music]
