People are often motivated to contribute to Open Source projects by their "right brain" creative and “artistic” side, more than on a financial rewards or career ambition basis.

However, the “left brain” financial and career rewards of being involved in Open Source are tangible in many cases, benefitting both employer and employee, especially when taking a mid-term or long-term view.

Programmers become better by learning new tools, techniques and programming style from brilliant community members. Communication and organizational skills are also greatly improved by being involved in multi-cultural remote communities, where decisions are made asynchronously and most often in writing. Being exposed to quality software all the time, which is common in projects that build the foundation of the Web, also helps us raise the bar on what we consider good software.

All this translates to greater efficiency on the job, greater software quality as well as improved soft skills and team efficiency.

The benefits of contributing to Open Source are demonstrated in many startups and companies, for both employee and employer. If your boss is not convinced of that yet, this talk will help change that!

	00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:09,910
hello so this talk is about how to

00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,799
convince your left brain to follow the

00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:15,219
open source path that you write for in

00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:18,190
desires and left-brain might also mean

00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:20,590
someone else like your manager will see

00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:22,930
that my name is Bethel ricotta

00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:24,640
I'm with Adobe in Switzerland I'm a

00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:27,160
principal scientist in the adobe

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,960
experience manager team and I'm also

00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,640
very much involved in open source I've

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,410
been on the board of directors of the

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,480
Apache Software Foundation for a number

00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:38,460
of years and quite active in several

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,460
projects and at the foundation level

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,659
let's start by you know what's exactly

00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:46,120
this left right brain thing you probably

00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:48,760
aware of it but just to be clear the

00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:51,879
left brain is what's commonly thought as

00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:54,399
being the logic you know the rational

00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:57,280
part of our brain of our thinking and

00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:01,659
the right brain is more artistic for the

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:04,659
creativity the the you know the only the

00:01:01,659 --> 00:01:07,299
impulses that the unclassified

00:01:04,659 --> 00:01:10,299
vague things that's the the right brain

00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:14,409
and we'll see how how both can work

00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:16,509
together and how open source addresses

00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:21,780
both actually open source contributions

00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:23,829
I would say let me start by by a story

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,200
more than 30 years ago I attended

00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:29,469
musicians Institute in Hollywood

00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,869
California a fantastic music school with

00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:34,450
great teachers but that was a one-year

00:01:31,869 --> 00:01:37,570
full-time program I did I was studying

00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:39,340
drums you can see me on the and there

00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:44,140
this yellow circle here at the

00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:46,810
graduation ceremony and there's four

00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:49,149
things that that I noticed about this

00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:50,710
experience that are pretty similar to

00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:53,799
what's haven't been happening to me an

00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:56,500
open source in this school there were

00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:58,270
there was a very friendly competition

00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,280
between players no you look at the

00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,929
others Oh today he played better than me

00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,909
and maybe tomorrow I can play better

00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:06,310
than him and it was all very friendly

00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:08,470
but you were always measuring your

00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,989
progress against the others and it was

00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:13,970
very you know very good incentive to get

00:02:10,989 --> 00:02:16,430
better and try to do try to do your best

00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:18,470
the second thing was making mistakes in

00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,630
public I did some very interesting ones

00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,220
in front of the whole cafeteria where

00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:25,880
people start looking at you what's this

00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:28,760
guy doing it's very interesting for your

00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,460
ego and then you also learn to accept

00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:35,180
that and fix them and there's a lot of

00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:36,980
Latino man sauce as well and the most

00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,620
striking thing for me about this school

00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:41,600
is how my my hearing improved I would

00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,460
listen to things that I recorded before

00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,070
school when I finished the school and

00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:48,080
and the mistakes were jumped in would

00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:50,540
jump in my face you know and before I

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,490
might not even have heard them and just

00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:55,190
by listening to great players for one

00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:57,410
year my hearing my musical hearing

00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:59,600
improved immensely and that that's an

00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:01,310
interesting also parallel with open

00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,990
source and this also gave me an

00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,480
opportunity to travel the world you know

00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:07,940
move to California have a baby there

00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,550
those are interesting experience and and

00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:11,780
where you learn a lot and we'll see that

00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,650
there's a number of parallels between

00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:17,930
that and my experience in open source

00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:20,270
coming back to the to the brain thing my

00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:23,060
right brain wants autonomy mastery and

00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:25,400
purpose really you know I want to be

00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,650
able to decide what I want to do and

00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,050
must do things that I master that I'm

00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,910
comfortable doing and for a purpose I

00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,739
think that's pretty common aspirations

00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:35,870
it's not you know there's a great book

00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:38,000
about that it's not nice for me but I

00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:41,000
think that that's a that that match is

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,209
my way of thinking about that the left

00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,030
brain wants food clothing shelter a few

00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:48,350
extras maybe but that's that's the basic

00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:52,010
thing you know it's more it's the

00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:54,470
rational aspects of the thing and can we

00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:56,540
demonstrate benefits to both sides from

00:03:54,470 --> 00:04:00,170
open source contributions I think we can

00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:02,930
and we see you know I'm thinking about

00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:05,360
my own left right brain but if you're in

00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,910
an organization like a company or an

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,540
organization also has a right brain side

00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:13,790
more creative and a left brain side what

00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:16,310
we sometimes call the bean counters you

00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:17,989
know there are all the money aspects of

00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:20,090
the company you need to make a living as

00:04:17,989 --> 00:04:22,640
a company you cannot just do only fun

00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:24,410
stuff so the left right brain analogy I

00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:26,090
think applies pretty well to companies

00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:28,620
or organizations

00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:32,040
and I think yes we can demonstrate

00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,990
benefits to both sides of this brain

00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:38,070
either human brain or the corporate

00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:40,320
brain the first thing that I that I

00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:43,260
think happens in you know when you

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,750
contribute to open source projects it

00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,699
fosters better programmers I have been

00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:50,630
contributing to open source since the

00:04:47,699 --> 00:04:53,520
early 2000 so 2000 almost 20 years now

00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:55,590
and I think I've better big become a

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,380
better programmer through that and

00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:01,169
really I didn't take any formal courses

00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:03,180
or very few I learned by osmosis by

00:05:01,169 --> 00:05:05,520
Lewin you know seeing what others are

00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,260
doing seeing red code reading code that

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,870
have been writing learning in

00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:11,430
discussions and you know when you when

00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:13,710
you discuss how you're going to solve an

00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,930
issue in an open-source project and that

00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:18,060
that's been immensely beneficial for me

00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:20,600
and I think it can work for others as

00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:23,610
well there are several reasons to that

00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,919
the first is that when you contribute to

00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:28,740
open source it's often pretty serious or

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,539
critical projects I'm taking the example

00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,490
of the Apache Software Foundation which

00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:35,160
is the the organization that are know

00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:37,050
best in this space which has about 300

00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,570
projects today many of those are

00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:43,020
industry changing or critical you know

00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:46,680
if I could mention Hadoop for example or

00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:49,200
Lusine or spark or the you know the HTTP

00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,940
webserver which which powers a large

00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,979
part of the internet all of these

00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:54,860
projects are industry standards they're

00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:57,419
critical they are very important and

00:05:54,860 --> 00:06:00,000
contributing to that means you need to

00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:02,280
do a good job plus it's in public you

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,320
know your your contributions are visible

00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,930
by everybody so you want them to be good

00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:11,130
and I think this Foster's you know put

00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:13,770
the quality of the code and also the

00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:16,590
there's the the same kind of friendly

00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:18,780
competition that that I saw at my music

00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:21,660
school well you know you're competing

00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:23,700
against others to to write good code not

00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,710
to be better than them but to do a great

00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:29,400
job overall you know to make sure the

00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:31,530
project is in really good shape and and

00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,210
by seeing all these contributions fly by

00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:34,460
with different styles with different

00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,639
techniques you

00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:40,789
not and and if you do mistakes in public

00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:42,979
if you're in a healthy community they

00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:45,289
will help you fix them you know they say

00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:47,180
this code could be better please how you

00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:49,910
could approve them and then you learn to

00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:52,669
improve it and you become better so yes

00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,990
I think definitely contributing to open

00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:57,410
source makes you a better programmer

00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:59,650
you're exposed to high quality code you

00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:01,729
you know you you you refine it

00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:02,690
collaboratively with others who might

00:07:01,729 --> 00:07:05,060
have different ideas different

00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,770
techniques and often you're exposed to

00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,440
above-average programmers there's a lot

00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:12,340
of excellent people you know CTO level

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,740
folks or people who have been doing the

00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,849
complex things for many years so I think

00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:19,430
that that's really that's really

00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:21,530
applause as well and also I think makes

00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:23,240
you happier because you get great

00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:25,070
results you can see the impact of what

00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,990
you're doing and that's the you know

00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:29,750
that's the purpose part of the autonomy

00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:31,880
mastery and purpose so yes I think

00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:36,289
definitely contributing to open source

00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:37,819
makes people better programmers I think

00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:41,090
it also makes people better

00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:42,710
communicators you know when you work in

00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:45,199
an open source project it's a

00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:47,150
multicultural environment it's remote

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,610
its distributed people are different

00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:51,229
time zones different bosses different

00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,509
cultures different mother tongues

00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:56,360
there's a lot of diversity which makes

00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:59,060
it harder to communicate and collaborate

00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,979
and especially the asynchronous

00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:03,169
collaboration techniques using

00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:05,539
open-source projects are extremely

00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:08,330
useful and an extremely valuable skill

00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:09,949
to learn for a programmer you know in

00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:11,690
today's distributing my work

00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:13,520
environments that's something that you

00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:16,669
need to have many companies today's

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,460
today are working in a distributed way

00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:22,280
and you learn to express your programs

00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:23,659
clearly and work in small manageable

00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,659
units you know you have to break down

00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:27,949
the problems in things that you can

00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:29,870
explain to the community and that

00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:31,280
someone can understand or validate it

00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:33,919
and work with you on it

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,539
so that that's really that's very very

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,820
useful skills to learn these

00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:40,070
asynchronous collaboration techniques

00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,229
which are widespread and which have been

00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:44,209
in a large pot invented in open source

00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:46,400
projects I think I have another talk

00:08:44,209 --> 00:08:48,080
about that which goes into more detail I

00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,130
have a link at the end of this

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,740
this presentation if you're interested

00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:56,630
so yes I think definitely contributing

00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,030
to open source projects makes you better

00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:01,100
communicators because you learn to

00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:03,860
collaborate asynchronously in this I

00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:05,560
call that low emotional bandwidth

00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:08,150
environments you know when you

00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:12,110
communicating in writing in email

00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:14,240
mailing lists or in in tickets it's it's

00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:16,730
hard to convey your emotions you can use

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,010
a few Smiley's but it's it's pretty hard

00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:21,620
it makes the communication harder and it

00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:23,480
sometimes leads to misunderstandings but

00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:25,130
you have to you know you'll be learning

00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,330
to work through that and that that's

00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:30,230
very useful then if you later

00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,790
communicating in them in a higher

00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:34,940
bandwidth environment like in the

00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:37,520
company you can use these skills and you

00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,650
know take advantage of them to to to

00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,290
more look serious I would say or more

00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:45,140
efficient communication environments and

00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:47,360
this again this also makes you happier

00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:49,850
because it's efficient you get concrete

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,920
results so it will you know it's a it's

00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,960
good for your for your happiness as well

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,730
which is an important part of this you

00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,930
are in the more in the right way inside

00:09:55,730 --> 00:10:02,180
but even if you think about left brain

00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:04,040
you know manager or company wants to

00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,630
have happy employees that's how you keep

00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,600
people that's how you keep them

00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:10,700
motivated that that's how you keep them

00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,320
engaged so I think happiness is also a

00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:18,050
very important aspect of these things

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,600
the third element that that I think

00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:24,650
people benefit from in in open-source

00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,720
settings is traveling we say we often

00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:29,990
say that travel is the best education I

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,950
think it is it's it's you learn a lot of

00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:35,480
things by traveling you don't

00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:37,730
necessarily travel physically when you

00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,370
do open source contributions you know

00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:42,710
but your interactive interacting with

00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:44,690
multicultural communities also have

00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:48,110
another talk on this which goes in more

00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:50,990
detail but briefly you know it's harder

00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:53,150
to contribute within multicultural

00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:54,980
communities if you come from a certain

00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:57,800
place you're used to certain idioms

00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:59,960
certain ways of saying things certain

00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,930
jokes which might not work in a

00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,149
different culture

00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:04,800
so you have to adapt to that and it's

00:11:03,149 --> 00:11:06,420
often harder to understand each other

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,580
when you when you're in a multicultural

00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:11,100
environment especially with this low

00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:11,670
bandwidth channels that we mentioned

00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,760
before

00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:18,000
so learning to do that will make you you

00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,830
know more efficient in your work it's

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,110
kind of travelling without moving

00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:24,570
because you you might be staying at your

00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:26,130
desk but talking to many people from

00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,600
different different cultures and

00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:29,820
different countries different places

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,800
different companies which also have

00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:34,860
their own cultures and I think it's very

00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:37,290
it's very rich it's very enriching to

00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:40,580
work in these in these environments so

00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:43,140
yes travelling is great education and

00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:45,180
working in multicultural environments is

00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,700
a format of travel even if you don't

00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:49,589
travel physically and then you can also

00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,839
travel physically you know open-source

00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:53,640
communities often they have meetups

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,800
which might be in your hometown so you

00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:59,070
don't might not need to travel far but

00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,440
still meeting new people or maybe these

00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:05,160
the next town or maybe even the world

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,800
you might go to a faraway place - an

00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,420
open-source conference and then it's

00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,089
proper travel of course and you will

00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:13,589
you'll learn from from that as well of

00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:15,570
course this can be expensive not

00:12:13,589 --> 00:12:16,740
everybody has resolved financial

00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:19,980
resources to do that

00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:22,470
but many organizations have helped can

00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,060
help you do that like coming back again

00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:27,690
- to Apache the Apache Software

00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:29,279
Foundation Apache as a travel assistance

00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:31,650
committee which is meant just for that

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:34,050
so if you have demonstrated merit in in

00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:37,320
an Apache project you can apply to this

00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:39,959
committee to have financial help for for

00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,760
the Apache conferences not everybody can

00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,589
be accepted there's a limited budget of

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,829
course but that's a great way to to

00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:48,720
travel and you know be help you be more

00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:51,089
efficient be more productive in this

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,120
organization so you will certainly also

00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:58,050
get to actually travel with your through

00:12:54,120 --> 00:13:01,110
your contributions so yes I think travel

00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:03,149
is the best education as we say and I

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:06,390
think you will you can become a better

00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:08,190
and again happier person by travelling

00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:10,800
either actually to conferences or

00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:13,889
virtually by just meeting these these

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:17,970
people in for multicultural

00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:20,009
groans so I'm already at the the

00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:23,069
conclusion which are called coda you

00:13:20,009 --> 00:13:25,410
know based on my musical background and

00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:28,139
I think yes contributing to open source

00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:30,859
communities leads to better programmers

00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:32,639
because you refine critical software

00:13:30,859 --> 00:13:34,769
collaboratively with friendly

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,959
competition in open environments so

00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:39,239
that's really a recipe for becoming a

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:41,129
better programmer again by seeing code

00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:42,989
that's that's different from what you

00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:45,449
will have written gives you new ideas

00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:47,790
seeing tools that you might not be used

00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:51,419
to and that you will learn these

00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:52,919
environments and so on contributing to

00:13:51,419 --> 00:13:55,859
open source also leads to better

00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:57,959
communicators because you will learn to

00:13:55,859 --> 00:14:00,239
collaborate asynchronously in

00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:01,639
environments which are low bandwidth and

00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:04,259
harder to communicate

00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:06,689
than then in you know with physical

00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:09,749
direct face-to-face environments so

00:14:06,689 --> 00:14:11,429
that's very very useful skills and I

00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:14,249
think it also can make you a better

00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:16,679
person by this travel that we mentioned

00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:19,230
working in multicultural environments

00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:21,569
and traveling the world either virtually

00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:25,499
or actually so I think that's three very

00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:28,439
important points that you can hopefully

00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:30,239
quantify for the left brain you know the

00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:32,399
left side of your brain or for your

00:14:30,239 --> 00:14:36,149
manager as we said so these are

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:38,549
important skills that can have an actual

00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:41,970
concrete impact on the quality of your

00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:43,980
work so thank you for listening if

00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:46,110
you're if you're at first backstage I'll

00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,660
be available for questions in the video

00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:50,939
conference after this otherwise thank

00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:52,980
you and there's a link here two more

00:14:50,939 --> 00:14:55,350
talks about the topics that I mentioned

00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,470
which are in my virtual press book thank

00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:57,470
you

00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:10,050
thank you now for any questions and

00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:10,050
answers and I hope this works

00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:19,240
hello hello can you hear us yes yes very

00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:22,779
good and thank you for your talk

00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:24,579
it was very good I'm gonna open it up to

00:15:22,779 --> 00:15:30,000
questions so does anyone have any

00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:33,139
questions for which one yep got one here

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,139
[Music]

00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:40,870
thanks for the talk and do me at least

00:15:37,209 --> 00:15:44,139
you touched upon some very obvious let's

00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:45,970
say side side effects of contribution

00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:48,760
contributing to open source my question

00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:50,920
to you is I think most of the people who

00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,649
are involved in one way or another in

00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,810
open source would agree that these are

00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:58,329
actually true the question is do you

00:15:55,810 --> 00:16:00,279
think that there could or should be a

00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:03,339
way to somehow measure those and

00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:05,320
quantify those or I can think of a

00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:07,449
number of reasons why that could be

00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:24,130
useful but I wanted to hear what your

00:16:07,449 --> 00:16:36,060
opinion is it is it's a difficult

00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:45,730
measure you know you know asking people

00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:47,949
how much do you think and you take like

00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:55,440
I was saying like my eighties I haven't

00:16:47,949 --> 00:16:55,440
I've taken very few courses but I think

00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:09,970
that don't be one way quantify either

00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:13,199
people indicated where they think people

00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:13,199
think you have justice

00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:54,230
I agree okay and we have any more

00:17:53,010 --> 00:18:00,780
questions

00:17:54,230 --> 00:18:04,440
yeah we have one Hey you talked about

00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:06,150
this autonomy mastery purpose which are

00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,630
these nice ingredients of intrinsic

00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:12,360
motivation so we are seeing sauce

00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:14,310
happening a lot not only in this kind of

00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,530
volunteer context where you decide to

00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:18,630
open a sauce but also in the company

00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:21,060
context where it might be just part of

00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:23,250
your job to do almond sauce so how do

00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:25,500
you but what's your view on how you keep

00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,420
this intrinsic motivation when not

00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:41,340
working in a volunteer environment but

00:18:27,420 --> 00:19:11,700
more in a corporate environment okay of

00:18:41,340 --> 00:19:13,440
course which Canada can take and then

00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:19,530
they have different phrases we're going

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:22,299
to technical and tactical mode where you

00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:25,309
know you go to employ water

00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:27,289
and the writings in the technical point

00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:32,179
of view I think then that that has

00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:41,840
helped me pretty clearly if you would

00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:44,419
spend money could be okay and we sexy

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:54,789
one would like but we have and then they

00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:58,340
have a different phrase if you want to

00:19:54,789 --> 00:20:09,019
avoid any tactical dead and it's good to

00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:12,549
have we Disney ironic thanks thank you

00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:26,419
for the talk by the way can you see us

00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:26,750
yes yes so but I have to look there to

00:20:26,419 --> 00:20:31,970
see you

00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:34,610
so talked about source or convincing

00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:36,350
your manager in the sense that open

00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:40,070
source makes you a better programmer

00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:43,399
better communicator but how about the

00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:46,490
argument that maybe open source also you

00:20:43,399 --> 00:20:48,950
know helps the business itself like to

00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:51,049
to reach their goals faster and to save

00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:53,210
costs because yeah when you get involved

00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:55,429
actively in your project that you might

00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:57,260
actually have to like employ fewer

00:20:55,429 --> 00:20:59,360
employees we can use you could just

00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:01,429
influence the influence the direction of

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:20,659
a project with that be also a good

00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:34,029
argument for the left side brain it's so

00:21:20,659 --> 00:21:43,690
much no it cannot

00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:51,330
I used the honey 50 people we do surveys

00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:56,340
and it gave us reputation so I stole a

00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:56,340
look at Kelly at the road

00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:08,080
yeah so my what I was saying is really

00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:12,460
focused on people poor people people

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:20,049
kill people yeah those are really good

00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:22,589
