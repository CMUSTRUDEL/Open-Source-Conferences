Title: #FOSSback: Emmy Tsang - A community-driven approach towards open innovation for research comms
Publication date: 2020-03-25
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2020 #FOSSback
Description: 
	More info: https://20.foss-backstage.de/session/community-driven-approach-towards-open-innovation-research-communication

The advancement of web technologies has created an opportunity for developing tools for real-time collaborations, text-mining, interactive data visualisations, sharing reproducible compute environments, etc. These tools can change the ways researchers share, discover, consume and evaluate research and help promote open science and encourage responsible research behaviours. 

Through its Innovation Initiative, eLife invests heavily in software development, new product design, collaboration and outreach so that the potential for improvements in the digital communication of new research can start to be realised. 

In particular, we support exclusively the development of open-source tools, with extensible capabilities, that can be used, adopted and modified by any interested party and actively engage the community of open innovators. In this talk, we will introduce the following projects: 
* Fostering collaboration and innovation through hacking: eLife Innovation Sprint (https://elifesci.org/Sprint) 
* Mentoring and empowering a generation of open innovators: eLife Innovation Leaders (https://elifesci.org/InnovationLeaders) 

We believe that openness is crucial to the future of research, and by supporting the community and promoting open-source research software, we can help build a culture towards integral, collaborative, open and reusable research. We hope to share some of our visions and learnings, and invite feedback and contributions from the wider open-source community on the next steps forward.

	00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:09,340
yeah starting in this quote we have

00:00:05,649 --> 00:00:12,099
failed the internet the internet was

00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:14,170
built by scientists for scientists so

00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:17,050
that they can share their results with

00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:18,820
more people faster and easier the

00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,800
internet I think all of you would agree

00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:23,080
has changed the way that we communicate

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,970
a lot of informations so I'll give you

00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:27,760
some examples and I'm gonna spend some

00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:29,529
time elaborating them so later you'll

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,750
see you know sort of the contrast that

00:00:29,529 --> 00:00:37,300
exists between other types of

00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:39,969
information and research so for example

00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:43,000
looking at how you can find out about

00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:45,219
the scores of a football match a hundred

00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,480
years ago you probably have to wait

00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:48,219
until the match is over

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,070
you read the newspaper the next day

00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:54,460
there'll be like a static photo some

00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:56,500
text and you get the score nowadays I

00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:59,320
just found out when I was preparing for

00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,480
this you actually get these sort of live

00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,239
streams on YouTube which is called 360

00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,729
degrees video so while their matches

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,700
playing life you could pan around the

00:01:06,729 --> 00:01:11,979
stadium and see whatever bit you want to

00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,680
you want to see from whatever angle you

00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:16,570
want so I think we can all agree that

00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:21,420
that's sort of a huge improvement from

00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:24,670
from that static image another example

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,670
so I just arrived at this new city and I

00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:29,200
want to find out good restaurants to eat

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,659
100 years ago I'd be looking at a

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,640
guidebook there will be like a limited

00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:35,979
list of restaurants I'd be relying on

00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,650
the comments from this author of the

00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:40,240
book and then there will be an address

00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:42,579
and now I have to check another map and

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,579
go there nowadays within a couple of

00:01:42,579 --> 00:01:48,430
seconds you can use your GPS and with

00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:51,430
the maps you can get all the restaurants

00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:55,180
around you you can get crowdsource

00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:57,729
reviews and ratings real-time you can

00:01:55,180 --> 00:02:01,090
filter the results by your you know

00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:05,229
dietary requirements or preferences and

00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:07,180
with another click you get instantaneous

00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:10,810
directions of the fastest way to get to

00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:14,950
that restaurant and that's that's really

00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:16,230
again a big change and what I'm about to

00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:19,470
tell you is the situation

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:23,099
in how we communicate research so first

00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:25,260
to sort of step back you have to first

00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:28,799
understand how research is communicated

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:31,230
nowadays so let's say I'm a PhD student

00:02:28,799 --> 00:02:34,230
working in the lab I do my research I

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,760
spent hours and hours slaving over my

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,590
experiments and then finally after like

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:41,430
three four years I have some results I

00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:43,230
write them into the form of a manuscript

00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:46,019
I submit the manuscript to the journal

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:49,200
the journal then has these editors that

00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:51,180
reach the manuscript sends it to what we

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,069
call peer reviewers so these are sort of

00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:55,829
experts in my research fields who will

00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:57,540
be able to read my work critically and

00:02:55,829 --> 00:03:00,450
to give me comments so it will come back

00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:03,379
to me with revisions so these are

00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:06,959
comments on how you can improve those

00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:08,579
the work that I've done so I either I

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,470
have to rewrite something I have to do

00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:12,510
some analysis again or some new

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,980
experiments and then send it back to the

00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:16,230
reviewers and this happened a couple of

00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:18,989
times before we're happy that the work

00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:21,930
is worthwhile for publishing so then it

00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:23,730
appears on sort of this journal which is

00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:28,019
now a website used to be in print like a

00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:29,250
physical book I'm gonna point out some

00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:31,739
problems with this process at the moment

00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:34,079
in in a moment so that there are four

00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:36,959
main problems the first the first

00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:39,900
problem is that is extremely long so the

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,000
average time from research submission so

00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,769
the the writing and submitting not

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,989
counting the time for the research to

00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:48,720
actual publication on average at the

00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:51,120
moment it's nine months it isn't sound

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,060
long but think think about a very

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,010
relevant situation at the moment so the

00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,950
coronavirus that we've all been talking

00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:02,579
about the outbreak was discovered what

00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:05,129
was publicized in January so let's say

00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:08,849
for some miraculous reason the research

00:04:05,129 --> 00:04:11,250
was done in there within one day and the

00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:14,040
the researchers wrote everything up in

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:17,430
one day as well and then they submitted

00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,799
to the journal and on that average time

00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,720
we would not have seen anything coming

00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:23,099
out from the research at this point and

00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,250
we would not see it for another four or

00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:28,260
five months and that's a big problem

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,090
because it means that this process is

00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:34,290
stopping the communication

00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:36,389
research in timely manner and it's also

00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:39,180
a very very stressful process for the

00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:41,190
people who are involved so an average

00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,520
PhD student has about four years to

00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:46,020
finish their research otherwise the

00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:50,340
grant money runs out or you cannot

00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:52,500
graduate etc etc and to think that you

00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,090
know this while on average it takes nine

00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,860
months for this submission process to go

00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:59,729
through it can take anywhere between

00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:03,090
sort of nine months to two years three

00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:05,700
years I've heard and in the current sort

00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:08,520
of research environment a publication is

00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:12,300
crucial for their career progression

00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,800
without a publication they cannot get to

00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,800
the next step

00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,630
to the next job and so this creates a

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,780
lot of stress it's called the publish

00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:24,330
and publish or perish mentality which is

00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:27,830
very unhealthy I used to be a researcher

00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,830
that was the primary reason why I left

00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:37,740
the third problem is that it's closed

00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:39,870
what I mean by that is there's a lot of

00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:41,940
discourse during that peer review and

00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,889
revision process pretty much like if you

00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,919
have that discussion over a pool

00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:49,860
Crossland github that happens during

00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:51,840
that process but in the end the only

00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:54,360
thing the scientific community sees most

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,430
of the time is the published paper you

00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,340
never see that discussion that happened

00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:01,710
you never understand why a paper was

00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:04,410
rejected or revised at any point you

00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:07,979
just see the results so everything looks

00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:11,910
perfect on the paper because you don't

00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:16,099
see the the mistakes or anything and the

00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:16,099
worst things the worst thing is

00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:21,150
sometimes you don't even see the

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,090
publication because journals hold the

00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:27,530
copyright over the publication and they

00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:29,550
impose these things called paywalls so

00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:32,310
institutions and libraries have to pay a

00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:35,160
massive sum of subscription fees to

00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:37,229
journals to be able to see those to be

00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,669
further researchers to access those

00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:43,169
publications even if it's their own and

00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:43,920
imagine that if you are from an

00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:46,440
institute without

00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:48,900
much money you're basically barred from

00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:51,960
that knowledge and that leads me to my

00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:56,360
final point this process is extremely

00:06:51,960 --> 00:07:01,410
expensive and it's extremely profitable

00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:04,230
so the one of the biggest publishing

00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:07,940
companies called Elsevier they're

00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:11,190
operating margin last year was 37% to

00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:13,130
put that in perspective the operating

00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:17,220
profit margin for Google last year was

00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:19,440
24% and the scholarly publishing system

00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:22,320
profits so much because it's so

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,910
profitable because you have to do the

00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:25,860
journal doesn't pay the scientist to do

00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:27,300
the research they don't pay the peer

00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,280
reviewers to do the reviewing and

00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,840
they're getting money from scientists

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,850
and institutions for reading the

00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,660
research and for publishing and it's

00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:38,430
ridiculous

00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:42,360
and just to sum it all up I love this

00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:45,780
analogy so it takes about nine months to

00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,730
send a rover from Earth to Mars and so

00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,340
what you can imagine if I'm PhD student

00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:52,970
I would print out my manuscript attach

00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:57,120
it to this Rover get it sent to Mars

00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:59,670
have it like put the physical sheets of

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,800
paper on the surface of Mars use though

00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:04,860
camera thingies on the top of the rover

00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:08,070
to take images of the paper beam it back

00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:11,790
to earth and that would still be faster

00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:13,500
than publishing in the journal it was it

00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:15,240
would be open because this is supposedly

00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,830
government-funded and all the data that

00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,410
comes back from those cameras can be

00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:26,940
accessed on the Internet and it will be

00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:28,710
cheaper and so you would have thought

00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:32,670
that after all that money and time and

00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:34,620
effort the way that the output of this

00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:37,530
must be Stella must be something amazing

00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:41,190
and the thing is that it's not so the

00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:43,860
research itself is good but the way that

00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:46,950
we communicate research hasn't changed

00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:49,140
for like a hundred years okay yeah I I

00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:50,910
have to admit that you know you there's

00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,070
like links that you can click now and

00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:55,110
like some resources theater set so you

00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:56,760
can download for example but it's not

00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,810
like we now have amazing interactive

00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:01,950
figures

00:08:57,810 --> 00:09:04,500
you can spin around in 3d or open peer

00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:06,900
reviews that you can look at the ratings

00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:10,700
of the reviewers so there's a lot of

00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:13,800
room for research communication to be

00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:16,940
faster to be more cost effective to be

00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:19,580
more open to be more user friendly and

00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,720
that is sort of the reason why my

00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:24,779
organization exists so I'm the

00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:28,080
innovation community manager Elife this

00:09:24,779 --> 00:09:31,920
is our mission is on the wall of our

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:34,080
office we like to help scientists

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,360
accelerate discovery by operating a

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,490
platform for research communication that

00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:43,470
encourages and recognizes responsible

00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:47,670
behaviors in science we do this we're

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:49,140
funded by some of the biggest research

00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,750
funders in the world so the Max Planck

00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:54,240
Institute the Wellcome Trust Hughes

00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:57,810
Medical Institute and the Wallenberg

00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,270
foundation we do this by publishing some

00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:02,460
of the best works in the life sciences

00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:05,130
working with an editorial community that

00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:08,880
allows us to do that fully open access

00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:10,980
and online we do that by working very

00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:15,710
closely with early career researchers to

00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,710
and involve them in our governance to

00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:20,339
involve them in the peer-review process

00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,770
and to make sure that they can build a

00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:28,230
research ecosystem that works for them

00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:29,820
and we also do that by what I'm gonna

00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:32,220
introduce next which is called the e

00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,180
life innovation initiative so I leave

00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:35,790
this initiative

00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,740
it's a separately funded effort and our

00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:40,650
mission is to drive open innovation for

00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,470
open science so the belief the

00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:45,540
fundamental belief here is that

00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:47,370
technology can change our behavior and I

00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,589
don't think I need to convince a lot of

00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:51,480
people here that that's true I mean look

00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:53,550
at the way that we've been using you

00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,990
know our phones and Google Maps and

00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:57,240
other types of innovation have changed

00:10:54,990 --> 00:11:00,450
the ways that we've gone around doing

00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,430
day to day life so our sort of

00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:05,190
fundamental assumption and what we're

00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:07,290
hoping is that by developing tools that

00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:09,720
makes it easy to do the right things

00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:11,640
when you communicate research it will

00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:17,010
help drive more people to it

00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:18,560
route so I've explained why innovation

00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:22,260
is the is the approach that we're taking

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:28,380
but why open innovation what is open

00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:30,149
innovation so I sort of want to contrast

00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,560
two slightly different concepts here

00:11:30,149 --> 00:11:34,500
which I think previous speakers have

00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:37,170
also touched on something called opened

00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,490
by default and open by the sign so I

00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:41,970
learned a lot of these concepts from

00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:43,890
Mozilla open leaders they're great and I

00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,779
think a lot of this talk is borrowed

00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:48,870
from various different places so just

00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:52,019
bear with me so open by default is for

00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:53,700
example if you sort of just put all your

00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:58,050
code online without any explanation

00:11:53,700 --> 00:12:00,649
without any descriptions or ways to

00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:04,519
facilitate people start contributions

00:12:00,649 --> 00:12:06,750
it's chaotic it's not easy to follow

00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:07,829
open by design is that it's very

00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:12,690
intentional

00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:14,579
it's very strategic and the idea is that

00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:17,220
it should be inclusive and open for

00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:19,199
revision so if I'm a newcomer to the

00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,899
field I should be able to find very

00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:24,779
quickly and effectively how to

00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:26,790
contribute how to get help and how to

00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:30,240
recognize other people's and the people

00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:32,910
in the contribution so what we're

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,839
striving for a tee life is open by

00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:39,810
design type open innovation why do we

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:41,459
think this is important so if we forget

00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:43,500
about the openness part and we just say

00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:45,480
we want to make good tech that will

00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,459
change behavior we can just ask the

00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,699
publishers who you know already know

00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:53,220
research communication super well and

00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:55,589
can easily you know build tools that

00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,899
will change behaviors and make life

00:12:55,589 --> 00:13:00,510
people's life easier and in fact they're

00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:04,769
already doing this so this is Elsevier

00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:07,440
the 37% operating margin company that I

00:13:04,769 --> 00:13:09,690
mentioned earlier this is their map of

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,230
how their tools and api's are linking

00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:16,860
together some of the information systems

00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:19,079
that are supporting research the problem

00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,940
with this map is other than everything

00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:22,949
other than the some of the bubbles on

00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:25,110
the outside everything in the middle is

00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:29,160
owned by Elsevier

00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:31,470
and so we're basically by you know

00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:35,959
looping researchers and trying to get

00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:41,910
them to use this we're giving control to

00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:45,000
this company and our user data and are

00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:48,959
we sure that we want to you know hand

00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,880
over this open the the chance to you

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,490
know change research to a company that

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,880
is making that much profit I'm not

00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:59,100
entirely sure and the other thing is

00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:03,860
that you know the way the reason why

00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:06,149
research works this way at the moment

00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:10,950
there's a big underlying cultural

00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:15,089
problem and the current system is

00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:18,899
facilitating it and so by using the same

00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:21,720
actors to make to recreate the system

00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:26,339
even with better technology those biases

00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:28,200
are gonna persist and so I don't know

00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:32,790
how many of you have seen this soap

00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:35,250
dispenser video it's basically the point

00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:37,079
I'm trying to make here is we need to

00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:43,260
think about who is owning our knowledge

00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:47,190
structure and who should own it we need

00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:50,519
to put users and everyone a diverse

00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:54,890
community behind the design of these

00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:59,699
tools so that we are not propagating

00:14:54,890 --> 00:15:02,130
biases that we don't want and another

00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:05,310
sort of I think this generally applies

00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:07,550
to a lot of tools open tools but

00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:10,800
probably more specific to research tools

00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:13,829
it's the reason that if a research tool

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,959
is not open it leads to the least to

00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:19,769
people not being able to reproduce that

00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:22,199
research so the example is let's say I

00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:24,449
take as an image of a tissue with a

00:15:22,199 --> 00:15:26,550
microscope if I don't own that

00:15:24,449 --> 00:15:28,500
microscope I don't have money to buy it

00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,839
I don't have access to it then I can't

00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:34,110
read I can't take that image again so I

00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:35,730
can't really reproduce or trust that

00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:36,470
result because I don't manage to do it

00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:39,000
myself

00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:43,110
so this applies

00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,860
to software if its proprietary a lot of

00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:49,230
the processes and maybe data analysis or

00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:50,910
data collection cannot be reproduced and

00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:58,410
that is that that is an issue that's

00:15:50,910 --> 00:16:02,009
specific to research itself so recap our

00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:03,810
vision is to create open inclusive user

00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:08,279
centric research communication tools

00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:10,800
together with the community so how do we

00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:12,870
do that I'm gonna sort of talk about two

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:17,430
things that we're doing at the moment

00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:21,180
and constantly revising as we go through

00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:22,889
and learn from the community so one idea

00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,029
that we had at the very beginning in

00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:27,750
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:30,089
was okay we have the researchers who

00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:32,579
know this problem really well and are

00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:34,410
very passionate about it but at the same

00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:35,939
time they may not necessarily have those

00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:38,819
tool development or software development

00:16:35,939 --> 00:16:42,990
skills we need to put them together in a

00:16:38,819 --> 00:16:46,850
room and give them time with people who

00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:51,779
know how to develop products how to code

00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:55,769
how to design etc and this gave birth to

00:16:51,779 --> 00:17:00,779
the 11 ovations sprint which takes place

00:16:55,769 --> 00:17:06,120
took place in Cambridge UK we brought 60

00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:09,209
people together for two days and let

00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:12,150
them work on prototypes so going back to

00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:14,069
my point about open by design the goal

00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:16,500
of this is specifically to create

00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:19,439
prototypes that are open inclusive and

00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:21,589
user centric we needed to build

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:25,409
processes that would facilitate that and

00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:28,559
so the whole sort of promotion of this

00:17:25,409 --> 00:17:30,659
event and the the application process is

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,150
very deliberately designed so that we

00:17:30,659 --> 00:17:37,890
could balance out the people who get to

00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:41,100
get there this was last year 2019 we had

00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:43,049
people coming from 16 countries we spent

00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:45,539
a lot of time getting sponsors to try

00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:47,730
and get them to pay for people to come

00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:50,700
from all over the world

00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:52,410
we had a gender quota to make sure that

00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:56,010
we achieved sort of

00:17:52,410 --> 00:18:03,780
their goals and yeah we had a good mix

00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:05,790
of researchers and in every one we we

00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:07,920
only had two days so we need to get them

00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:10,020
to know each other superfast so we had

00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,700
lightning talks at the beginning we had

00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:15,810
stickers to help them identify each

00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:20,280
other we had a document before the

00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:22,320
actual sprint where people pitch their

00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:25,860
ideas and get a discourse going around

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:30,000
it we also used a document to ask people

00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:31,620
if they need datasets for the for them

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,540
to create those prototypes and we load

00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:36,020
those datasets into our AWS cloud

00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:38,580
beforehand

00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:40,260
we had a slight channel during the event

00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:42,420
which we was projecting on the screen so

00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:44,040
that people can see where what what the

00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:47,430
projects needs help and where projects

00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:49,710
are we provided everyone with sort of a

00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:51,240
lean canvas to give them an idea of how

00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:55,350
they could potentially structure

00:18:51,240 --> 00:19:01,190
thinking about solution problem user fit

00:18:55,350 --> 00:19:04,890
for their specific projects and then and

00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:10,800
then there's any design sprints not

00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:12,420
short of post-its so yeah so so that's

00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,280
sort of like I'm sharing these thoughts

00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:16,020
as we learnt a lot of those in the

00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,760
community from the other community

00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:20,910
events and I think we're not unique but

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,340
I hope that if you happen to be

00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:26,360
organizing a hackathon or a sprint you

00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:32,610
will be able to take some of our ideas -

00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:33,990
so what did we create we really realized

00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:37,020
that the best ideas come from the

00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:38,100
community I'm not going to go through

00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,840
every one of them I'm just gonna

00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,820
highlight one particular one that is

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,500
very relevant at the moment but yeah

00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:46,260
check them out they are you know

00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,780
prototypes a lot of them got further

00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:52,560
funding because of the prototypes that

00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:54,270
they created at this hackathon with they

00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:58,110
were able to demonstrate to potential

00:19:54,270 --> 00:20:00,810
funders how what their visions are and

00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:02,370
that they have put in some sufficient

00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:05,910
work to develop a road map and a

00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:07,410
wireframe and yeah

00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:09,360
a lot of them are still in development

00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:13,320
so the one that I want to highlight is

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,970
pre review it's a crowdsourced reviewing

00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,310
platform for pre prints which are

00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:19,620
basically on peer-reviewed manuscripts

00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:21,630
so this was the coronavirus problem that

00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:25,470
I was talking about preprints allow

00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:28,080
these papers to get out before they are

00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:30,390
peer reviewed so when I'm ready when I'm

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:32,700
ready to submit I can prep it my paper

00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:37,200
and that instantaneously gets shared

00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:40,080
with the world so pre review is recently

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,400
partnered with another open source

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,290
project called outbreak science and

00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:46,530
basically this this particular project

00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:49,710
came I mean they literally was so timely

00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:51,300
it was that they partnered and then one

00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:55,200
month later there was the corona virus

00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:57,030
and so they really need help now so this

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,580
is a platform that they have developed

00:20:57,030 --> 00:21:01,170
to get people to try and review some of

00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,450
the pre prints coming out from corona

00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:06,000
virus research and so if you do know any

00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:07,920
scientists who can help like fill out 10

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,170
easy questions on how valid the research

00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:13,950
is and how good it is please direct them

00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:16,020
there and they also are hiring a

00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:17,610
software development team to try and

00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:19,560
help them out with platform development

00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:25,800
so if you're interested just let me know

00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:28,860
I can put you in touch ok that's all

00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:30,810
great we developed a lot of prototypes

00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:33,770
but everyone knows the problem with

00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:37,230
hackathons the prototypes most of them

00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:41,190
sort of just end there because people

00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:42,990
don't have time because people even if

00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:44,460
one person is super passionate they

00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:47,040
don't the skills maybe they don't have

00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:49,500
time and then it just sort of never gets

00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,090
followed up on so I sort of spotted this

00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,710
problem from the Sprint last year and I

00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:56,250
was like is there anything I can do

00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:59,720
about that how can we really empower

00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:03,570
people to develop sustainable prototypes

00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:07,490
and this led to the birth of another

00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:10,680
program called alive innovation leaders

00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:11,900
it's a 14 week open leadership and

00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,370
mentorship training program for

00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:19,070
developers developing opening prototypes

00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:22,759
for research it's ongoing it's not

00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:26,929
in February so it will end in May we

00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:29,480
have 27 participants coming from all the

00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:31,610
way from I think it's Melbourne

00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:36,529
Australia to the west coast of the US is

00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:41,059
all online what we do is we pair them

00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:44,179
one-to-one with a mentor and we also

00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:46,279
build a curriculum that covers arrive

00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:51,500
for a wide variety of projects that are

00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:53,480
needed to yeah be empower people to

00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,399
create those sustainable prototypes so

00:22:53,480 --> 00:23:02,629
I'm just gonna go in to that a bit more

00:22:55,399 --> 00:23:03,860
so you start with sort of talking about

00:23:02,629 --> 00:23:05,629
some of the things that we talked about

00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:08,779
today value exchanges within the

00:23:05,629 --> 00:23:11,960
community why are you equipped as an

00:23:08,779 --> 00:23:13,789
open leader you move on to road mapping

00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:17,059
and understanding users and

00:23:13,789 --> 00:23:19,009
understanding problems and prototyping

00:23:17,059 --> 00:23:21,950
processes and finally towards the end

00:23:19,009 --> 00:23:24,399
we'll probably talk about sustaining the

00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:26,539
project beyond the initial prototype and

00:23:24,399 --> 00:23:33,909
getting that funding and marketing

00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:36,740
efforts together so the we we do we do

00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:38,210
cohort calls every single week because

00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:40,690
of the time zone ahead to do two calls

00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:42,830
every single week and it's a lot of fun

00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:44,809
but we really learn a lot

00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:47,299
so the whole pedagogy or the whole learn

00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:50,379
idea of learning behind this program is

00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:53,269
that there's a lot of discussions so

00:23:50,379 --> 00:23:54,860
everyone sort of just goes into breakout

00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:56,419
rooms this is all done by zoom so you

00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,649
can sort people into rooms and then they

00:23:56,419 --> 00:24:00,440
can have discussions and then they

00:23:57,649 --> 00:24:03,169
report back and you write on the Google

00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,149
Doc what you've you've talked about and

00:24:03,169 --> 00:24:06,889
what you find interesting the amazing

00:24:05,149 --> 00:24:08,120
thing I find is that you know after a

00:24:06,889 --> 00:24:10,070
couple of weeks you thought like okay

00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,379
it's just discussion and nothing

00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:13,759
concrete's coming out but the sharing of

00:24:12,379 --> 00:24:16,519
experience and the fact that you're

00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:19,580
putting words down on paper essentially

00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:23,960
means you're creating knowledge on the

00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:25,399
go so we find that people are going back

00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,950
to these documents when they're actually

00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:29,389
working on maybe building user personas

00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,620
or roadmaps

00:24:29,389 --> 00:24:32,960
and looking at what other people are

00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:37,760
saying and then using that as a

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:39,289
friends and so it it just works it's

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,419
it's pretty it's pretty empowering

00:24:39,289 --> 00:24:43,340
because you once you realize that you're

00:24:41,419 --> 00:24:45,200
actually in this part of the process you

00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:49,789
realize that you may have the capability

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:53,029
to create something it's just a longer

00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:55,130
explanation of sort of our how we make

00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:57,740
sure that everyone can learn from each

00:24:55,130 --> 00:25:00,710
other and apply that knowledge by

00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:03,470
completing some assignments yeah so all

00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:05,440
of this we're learning ourselves as well

00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:07,789
as we're we're building this program

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:11,270
from our participants and what they want

00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:12,919
and I think the flexibility that we've

00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:15,020
designed and that the program is key for

00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:21,820
its growth and for the participants

00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:24,260
growth so two ongoing things what's next

00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:26,600
here I'm sharing sort of some thoughts

00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:28,610
that may be interesting to folks who are

00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:32,029
thinking about developing communities

00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:34,299
and yeah how to do it what are we trying

00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:36,799
to achieve basically because this is not

00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:38,179
your normal community you realize that

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,390
it's a bit different we're not trying to

00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:42,529
get everyone to use a certain product

00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:44,570
we're building what we're calling a

00:25:42,529 --> 00:25:47,120
community of practice which essentially

00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:50,470
means we're united by the goal a shared

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:56,480
goal of making research open and

00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:59,179
inclusive this was when we asked people

00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,029
on the survey on from the sprint about

00:25:59,179 --> 00:26:03,789
what was the most valuable outcome when

00:26:02,029 --> 00:26:06,110
they came to the Sprint and

00:26:03,789 --> 00:26:07,970
unsurprisingly and surprisingly because

00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:10,220
we we were so focused on wanting those

00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:12,950
products but what people actually value

00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:15,080
were other people so the connections

00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:19,520
were way more important than what they

00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:20,779
actually created again borrowing this

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,210
from what sale I don't know how many of

00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:24,860
you have seen this it's really shaped

00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,970
the way the mountain of engagement is

00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:31,940
really shaped the way that I thought

00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:34,429
about things so there's a sort of hit

00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:36,130
word at the moment on Twitter but it's

00:26:34,429 --> 00:26:38,299
called the architecture of participation

00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:40,970
so how do you build an architecture

00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:42,679
which allows different people coming in

00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:45,020
with different expertise and skills to

00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:47,960
be able to participate in the project

00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:50,450
so what you want to think about is how

00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:53,930
they would first discover your project

00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:56,780
and then how they would build up their

00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:59,510
initial interest to go step over that

00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:02,380
over that barrier of the first comment

00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:05,450
or the first issue or the first commit

00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:07,100
through to you know sustaining that

00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:09,980
participation and energy and then

00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:12,670
finally having them being able to take

00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:15,740
up that leadership role so the way that

00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:18,740
at least for my vision for a life

00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:20,330
innovation is that we support them

00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:23,300
through the different stages of their

00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:25,910
project building so they will maybe join

00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:28,160
at the Sprint or when they follow us on

00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:30,020
Twitter they will see the ideas of other

00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:32,330
people they get interested they will

00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:34,550
discover that there's a ecosystem out

00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:36,170
there trying to change things they come

00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:38,180
to the Sprint they will contribute their

00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:41,630
little ideas and realize that it

00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:43,550
actually can become prototype then they

00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:46,010
may say okay maybe I can actually lead

00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:47,450
this project now but what do I do

00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:50,840
then they were join us at innovation

00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:53,300
leaders and we will give them those

00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,190
skills and values those skills and

00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:57,680
connections that they may need to be

00:27:55,190 --> 00:28:01,250
able to launch the v1 or the MVP of that

00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:03,410
of that particular product so we're sort

00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:05,270
of there at the moment and having gone

00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:10,760
through the rest of it yet so this is

00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:14,720
the next challenge is to think about how

00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:16,040
do we reward people beyond just them

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,950
learning from each other and the

00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:22,760
network's that they built is there a way

00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:25,820
to tie what they're doing so researchers

00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:27,950
if they're contributing to open research

00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:29,630
software development is there a way to

00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:32,840
give them credit in terms of their

00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:35,960
career can we capture how much those

00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:38,450
software are being used so that that

00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,670
could somehow be reflected in whatever

00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:43,310
grant application they're making next I

00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:45,920
know this sound this all sounds like I

00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:47,660
really love that to happen and I'm very

00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:51,560
very glad that there are communities of

00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:54,080
people who are sort of supporting us and

00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:57,380
learning we're learning from each other

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,750
in that way so if you don't know already

00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:01,150
check them out sustained

00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:02,830
OSs working on sustainability of open

00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:04,510
source software and chaos working on

00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:07,900
measuring the health of open source

00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:10,660
software communities so yeah

00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:13,150
just learning and interacting with the

00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:15,370
community and hoping to learn from the

00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:17,620
bigger open source community because

00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:19,660
you've existed for a longer time and I'm

00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:26,290
sure that there are lessons that we can

00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:28,420
take from there as well so thank you for

00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:31,180
listening to this very long wine about

00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:33,550
research and communication but I hope

00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:35,380
you get an overview of what the problem

00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:37,930
is and what a potential solution may be

00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:39,970
if you'd like to join us at the next

00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:42,130
print we are about to go out with an

00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:46,600
announcement not now in about two weeks

00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:48,640
time so that's link to stay updated same

00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:51,480
for innovation leaders but later in the

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:55,330
year probably and I'm on Twitter and

00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:57,100
email if you have any questions beyond

00:29:55,330 --> 00:30:14,020
now but I'm happy to take it any

00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:18,460
questions now thank you hi thanks for

00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:22,090
your talk he talked about research

00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:26,100
software and often IV in the examples of

00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:29,140
stuff it was software which you need to

00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:31,120
like peer review or something like so it

00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,890
would be for me it's like software you

00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,560
need to run the concept or the whole

00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:37,930
process of research in general but often

00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:41,140
research software is also like

00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:43,330
simulation tools and stuff like that my

00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:45,100
question now is are you interested Mayer

00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:47,620
for the software which like supports

00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:50,140
research in like the research process or

00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:52,060
also like research software which

00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:54,790
supports the research itself like

00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:56,980
simulations and whatever yeah that's a

00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:59,350
really good question Thanks um our

00:30:56,980 --> 00:31:03,250
primary but our primary interest was in

00:30:59,350 --> 00:31:04,600
research communication software so tools

00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:06,960
that would change the way that we share

00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:09,730
discovery evaluate and consume research

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,260
that being said when we open up for

00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,960
example for the Sprint and also for

00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,430
innovation the

00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:15,590
we realized that a lot of people

00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:19,040
actually wanted to use those locations

00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:21,530
to develop open research tools so you

00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,910
know very tied to data processing for

00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:26,570
example very specific to a particular

00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:28,910
part of the research pipeline and we say

00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:31,600
why not because you know they benefit

00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:33,770
from the same types of interactions and

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:37,310
architectures of participation and

00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:38,870
expertise and so we've not say no and I

00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:40,600
love personally to support that

00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:44,000
community of research software

00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,530
developers which is really growing and I

00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,030
think it's really important that they

00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:50,080
get recognized for the work that they do

00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:54,380
which doesn't isn't happening now I

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:56,270
think I should comment that yeah exactly

00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:58,100
there's a whole community rze it's

00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:59,720
called and we also have that one in

00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:03,140
Germany here I'm helping running that

00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:05,660
also here in Berlin so yeah if

00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:08,900
somebody's interested sorry for yeah no

00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:10,880
I complete and all that so if someone is

00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:12,770
interested RC communities are growing

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:17,180
they're also in the UK I think the

00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:17,660
German conference is August 25th if I'm

00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:21,770
not wrong

00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:23,510
yeah and then there's also the UK one so

00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:25,640
this growing community is recognizing

00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:27,080
that you know we need software for

00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,550
research and hence we need people to

00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,130
develop those software's and it's better

00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:32,360
if they're done by people who know how

00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:34,190
to develop your software

00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:37,010
yeah and it's they have overlapping

00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:39,350
goals like open sourcing stuff but also

00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:41,390
making the whole process faster and more

00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:47,750
transparent so I think it's really good

00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:51,620
good join yeah exactly thank you yeah

00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:54,260
great talk kind of a slightly sarcastic

00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:58,700
comment but I'm guessing also fear must

00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:59,720
not be a big fan of you know we're

00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:04,040
friendly

00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:05,810
well ish I mean they like yeah their

00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:10,130
hope is model how are they dealing with

00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:12,920
that are they what do you mean how

00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:14,630
they're dealing with it well I don't

00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:16,910
know if I were a big company making lots

00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:18,980
of money and a group of people starts to

00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:21,740
do something that undermines my pretty

00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:25,309
much whole business and certainly my 40%

00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:27,289
in saying you know monopoly profits I

00:33:25,309 --> 00:33:29,600
only hire some lawyers and start looking

00:33:27,289 --> 00:33:34,610
at how to I don't know get rid of those

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:39,769
people somehow yeah are you saying now

00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:42,080
I'm gonna get sued of this I mean I love

00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:43,970
the thing that they are scared of the

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,249
things that are coming unfortunately

00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:48,169
that's not really the case they still

00:33:46,249 --> 00:33:50,240
have a huge Buy in from the research

00:33:48,169 --> 00:33:53,389
community you think that after all the

00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,499
stress and all the turmoil of you know

00:33:53,389 --> 00:33:56,269
researchers going through this

00:33:54,499 --> 00:33:57,950
publication process nobody will want to

00:33:56,269 --> 00:34:00,950
publish without Sofia ever again

00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:03,259
that's completely not true researchers

00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:05,440
because because academic prestige is

00:34:03,259 --> 00:34:08,599
everything and they've done such a good

00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:12,109
job at establishing themselves at the at

00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:14,270
the top of the hierarchy researchers

00:34:12,109 --> 00:34:18,050
would kill to get a paper in Elsevier

00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:20,359
journals it's a sad reality and that's

00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:22,970
why you know technology as much as I

00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:24,980
love it to change all the behaviors it's

00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:26,300
sort of the facilitation platform for

00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:32,050
all the cultural changes that can happen

00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:34,490
on top it just needs to be sort of yeah

00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:36,470
we are doing a lot of sort of community

00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:40,339
work and understanding what can drive

00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:42,020
people to get rid of that escape from

00:34:40,339 --> 00:34:43,700
that status quo and do something

00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:45,260
different despite the fact that you know

00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:49,669
you may not be able to see the return of

00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:51,679
that in a long time and it's again yeah

00:34:49,669 --> 00:34:53,179
I'd really love for Elsevier to think

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,950
that you know we're a threat but in the

00:34:53,179 --> 00:35:00,040
end we are really an egg hitting a wall

00:34:54,950 --> 00:35:00,040
so we need more people in this basic

00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:13,810
actually that was a very good way for me

00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:17,440
to bring my question which was basically

00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:20,080
okay so yes I think most people who'd

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,560
acknowledge what you say about Elsa

00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,210
Viren

00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:25,840
you know organizations like Elsevier

00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:28,450
let's not make it specific but there is

00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:30,100
a certain besides you know being the

00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:31,900
gatekeepers they actually got to be the

00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:34,270
gatekeepers for a reason which was you

00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:36,280
know there is the kind of value in peer

00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:38,470
review which is basically you know you

00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:41,290
get qualified people to give you input

00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:44,530
and so on and so forth so my question is

00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:47,770
so how can you attract qualified people

00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:50,980
to contribute in your platform and how

00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:53,290
can you vet them that's a really good

00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:58,540
question I agree with you 100 percent

00:35:53,290 --> 00:36:01,300
that peer review has value my question

00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:03,940
is always why does it have to be closed

00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:06,970
why can't this be in the open and why

00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:08,859
can't more people participate in it so

00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:11,109
think think reviewing a restaurant on

00:36:08,859 --> 00:36:12,640
Google right you're not only asking

00:36:11,109 --> 00:36:14,410
foodies to do that you're asking

00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,910
everyone to do that and they're gonna be

00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:18,430
spammers that are gonna be people who

00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:23,859
are paid to do the reviews but in one

00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:26,470
way or another we sort of manage and can

00:36:23,859 --> 00:36:27,580
the same be applied to research maybe

00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:31,690
maybe not

00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:33,400
it is an experiment we are I think

00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:36,190
different communities are sort of coming

00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:39,400
to settling on different levels of sort

00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:41,950
of vetting or accreditation for

00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:43,600
editorial communities beside editors

00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:46,420
themselves ultimately I can tell you

00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:49,800
because research is so specific to a

00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:52,840
specific field if I'm a PhD student in

00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:56,050
looking at this particular part of the

00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:58,540
brain in this particular animal I'm the

00:36:56,050 --> 00:37:02,290
expert in that and not that many other

00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:03,280
people are and so even if I'm junior in

00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:05,890
my research career

00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,930
I actually know quite a lot about what I

00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,460
know specifically probably more than

00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:11,520
someone who is working on a different

00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:14,590
area of the brain in a different animal

00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:18,550
so the question that we can never settle

00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:20,130
on is what is a qualified reviewer and

00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:23,050
then

00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:26,470
if we can all settle on that does it

00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:28,869
make sense to then make a barrier to

00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:31,000
stop other people or the wider wider

00:37:28,869 --> 00:37:36,010
research community from participating in

00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:38,770
this peer-review process I don't I don't

00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:45,250
see I personally don't see it I don't

00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:55,890
think the barrier is fair my PhD program

00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:55,890
I need to publish so can you explain

00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:19,030
[Music]

00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:20,560
yeah we have an impact factor we don't

00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:22,900
like to talk about it but you can always

00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,820
google it in fact if you type e life

00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:26,980
into Google it automatically gives you

00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:29,589
the impact factor which again is why

00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:31,990
tools can really encourage bad behaviors

00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:38,050
while we should really be moving away

00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:39,369
from impact factors yeah so I think the

00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:42,339
problem is that you have to start

00:38:39,369 --> 00:38:44,109
somewhere where people trust you so

00:38:42,339 --> 00:38:45,940
people need to believe that we're we're

00:38:44,109 --> 00:38:49,570
serious and it's helped by the fact that

00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:51,040
we're backed by serious people and you

00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:53,349
know we publish high quality research

00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:55,150
which the community generally agrees

00:38:53,349 --> 00:38:57,339
that is high quality so this is all sort

00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:59,740
of vague but it's true

00:38:57,339 --> 00:39:01,000
and then we can start changing things

00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:03,609
from that the problem is that if you

00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,040
start from a grassroot process project

00:39:03,609 --> 00:39:07,630
and you don't have that trust nobody is

00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,670
going to take you seriously I mean it's

00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:16,290
just a sad fact in in sort of the

00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:19,150
research community and Beyond yeah so so

00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:21,040
it's still very important we recognize

00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:22,839
the value of our editorial community the

00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,430
editors that we have our scientists and

00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:27,010
they're all very well regarded in their

00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:30,730
field so people believe what they say

00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:31,830
are good papers but again going back to

00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:33,480
that question I think this should change

00:39:31,830 --> 00:39:36,330
because

00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,890
you know the fact that someone Allah if

00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:39,390
you know the peer-review process you

00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:43,590
know that most of the time it sort of

00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:46,320
just editors asking people they know to

00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:48,300
review those papers and it's all based

00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,730
on this nebulous cloud of knowledge in

00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:54,480
the editors head which then it becomes

00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:56,150
extremely subjective and so there's

00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,410
definitely technology that we can use

00:39:56,150 --> 00:40:00,030
especially with the web and all the

00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:02,340
researchers profile most researchers

00:40:00,030 --> 00:40:04,380
profile being available on the web the

00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:08,070
technology that we can use to make that

00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:10,920
a bit fairer and more inclusive and more

00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:15,480
open I guess we're working on that as

00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:18,300
well so yeah it's it's a tricky question

00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:20,430
but the short answer is we're starting

00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:22,350
with we're starting with sort of the old

00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:26,420
ways of establishing trust but we're

00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:26,420
hoping to change that using that trust

00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:42,660
any more questions you're operating kind

00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:44,700
of at the intersection of science and

00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:46,950
research product development but also

00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:48,510
just open source open communities and

00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:50,850
I'm just curious to hear like what are

00:40:48,510 --> 00:40:52,380
some maybe unexpected challenges you ran

00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:54,600
into and like you know fusing these

00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:56,280
communities or surprises or maybe like

00:40:54,600 --> 00:41:02,910
positive stories that you would like to

00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:04,950
share Thanks Oh positive stories yeah we

00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:08,400
realized that people learn a lot when

00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:11,340
they work on intersections so academics

00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:14,100
don't or the academic developers they

00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:17,369
don't necessarily have those design or

00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:19,650
product backgrounds and so whenever we

00:41:17,369 --> 00:41:20,820
put them together it's sort of just so I

00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:23,550
remember the first time I heard about

00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:24,869
design thinking and this echoes with a

00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:26,850
few other people that I've worked with

00:41:24,869 --> 00:41:29,790
as well is you know why didn't I

00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:33,030
approach problems like this before it's

00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:35,910
just a new sort of realization and then

00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:38,190
yeah moving from an academic background

00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:41,040
myself into a sort of more product and

00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:43,020
software oriented company there are

00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,600
things that you then immediately

00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:46,980
realized that if only the academia took

00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,690
out some of these learnings from

00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:51,570
other communities they would have done

00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:54,359
so much better and rather than using you

00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:57,150
know papers to measure their output you

00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:58,830
would you know use other outcomes that

00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:01,080
you could define from the very beginning

00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:02,609
and you would manage you would learn how

00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:06,930
the time box your projects and things

00:42:02,609 --> 00:42:08,609
like that and so so yeah so there was

00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:11,580
another thing that I wanted to say yeah

00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:15,660
so the other thing is that we also

00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:17,940
realized that because researchers are so

00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:21,720
prone to do like they don't like we

00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:25,760
don't like to change so it's really

00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:29,070
about making it super easy and sometimes

00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:31,700
the metrics that you measure your UX

00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:33,810
efforts against are not the immediate

00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:36,180
outputs but rather the long-term

00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:37,109
outcomes of what happens at the end so

00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,790
this is like sort of an ongoing

00:42:37,109 --> 00:42:42,359
discussion that I was literally just

00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:45,990
having yesterday but yeah it's sort of

00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:48,210
realizing what's special about research

00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:50,520
software or soft open open source

00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:52,920
research software and being able to

00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:54,869
transfer some of those knowledge from

00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:57,780
the border software development open

00:42:54,869 --> 00:43:00,420
source space and make sure that we can

00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:02,810
we can be informed as we develop these

00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:02,810
products

00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:18,229
