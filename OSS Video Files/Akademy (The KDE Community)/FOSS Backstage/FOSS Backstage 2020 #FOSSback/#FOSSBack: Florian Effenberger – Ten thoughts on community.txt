Many activities these days, be it sports, social work, arts or free and open source software, are organized in some sort of community. If backed by a respective organization, this not only helps with setting up a structure, but also puts statutes and rules in place that set forth the values and ideals all contributors should share. Inside these communities, there can be various roles. Some of them are formalized, like the board of directors or the supervisory board, others are within dynamically grown groups that can change frequently. Either of those are ideally composed of experienced and enthusiastic community members who take leadership and responsibility.

Based on my experience from the last 16 years, I'd like to point out common problems when working in an international free and open source community, share mistakes I've made and tell how you can hopefully avoid them.

okay so let me start straightaway so

00:00:05,899 --> 00:00:11,009
yeah thanks for having me I'm I'm glad

00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:15,059
to be able to speak here today and be in

00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:16,650
Berlin and I'd like to connect more or

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:18,750
less seamlessly to the talk we have

00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:22,439
before and would like to give you some

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:26,730
insight on lessons learned a pitfall

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:29,400
traps to avoid things how from my

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,610
perspective an open source community can

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,590
work out and of course he always need to

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,280
read that in in a specific context this

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:40,770
is ten items that I identified they are

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,470
not conclusively depending on which kind

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:47,940
of project what your background is what

00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:50,220
your what your project's goals is these

00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,700
things could be different but this is

00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:56,850
what we learned we that is the the

00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,980
librivox project that I'm part of and I

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,230
hope that provides some benefit for the

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,330
work you do some some more inside some

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:07,740
things so I'm in the whole feed for like

00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:08,939
16 years and as you know what the

00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,189
Liebherr office area a lot of things

00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:15,119
have changed have developed and are

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:17,340
constantly developing and so reserve

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,899
there's a couple of things so my my

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,539
official role is that I'm executive

00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:25,049
director of the document foundation that

00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:27,119
is the entity behind LibreOffice and I

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,880
was there from the beginning so I was

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,890
one of the founders and was also back in

00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,429
the days with the open office or project

00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:37,289
and seen everything developing over the

00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:41,399
course of time and and how the whole

00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:43,289
area changed and I tried to share a

00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:47,579
couple of bits and pieces from from that

00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:49,409
time so one of the when when we have job

00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,299
interviews at the document foundation

00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,399
one of the more interesting questions

00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:56,399
for the candidates is like what is a

00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,499
community and we get a ton of actually

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,479
pretty good answers one candidate one

00:01:58,499 --> 00:02:04,700
started to to paint that on a paper so

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,709
everybody has a slightly different

00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:11,160
understanding of what it is and one that

00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:14,130
I like a lot and that is taken from the

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,170
German Wikipedia article that talks

00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,970
about a group of people which we had

00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,190
hurt before it's made out of actual

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:23,760
people we are we are not in the face yet

00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:27,480
that we have AI running to show share

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:31,080
that entity I think is key and joint

00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:34,020
interests and it already starts with the

00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,739
question a group of people what is their

00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:40,380
background so you can be there in a pure

00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:42,060
private capacity private contributors in

00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:45,000
in the LibreOffice project we have a lot

00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,370
of these you can be there solidly with

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,350
your corporate hat or and this is hope

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,900
you see more and more that of course

00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:54,360
more and more people have jobs that are

00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,209
related to open source to free software

00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,640
and they contribute more and more so

00:02:57,209 --> 00:03:01,440
it's it's not mutually exclusive that

00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,900
that kind of thing that you either are a

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,290
corporate contributor or in a private

00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,480
capacity in the end a company doesn't

00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,680
act people act and so in the end it

00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,030
doesn't matter so much

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,110
who is what is your background you're

00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:20,459
part of that community

00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:23,790
and what we've learned is that is quite

00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:25,500
critical to to have those common memory

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,640
things you can talk about like a bit

00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,820
with old school friends you have

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,739
memories you can share and at least for

00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:34,260
us in the LibreOffice project that is

00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:36,090
one of the key things that when you meet

00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,310
people you haven't seen for a long time

00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:40,440
that there are things you you remember

00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,840
things common feelings common events

00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,150
that you attended something that unites

00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:49,320
you that builds that kind of group

00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:52,980
feeling that is not important what I

00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:55,140
don't like so much is that I think these

00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,840
days the term community is actually

00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:59,940
quite abused so you have any random food

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,470
producer running a website with a forum

00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,780
or a chat and it's immediately a

00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,970
community might be in a technical sense

00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,519
but this is not what I am addressing to

00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,530
me it's a bit more so I think kind of

00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,420
the marketing that is done these days

00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,420
you have all sorts of communities around

00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:17,220
the washing powder and and what not

00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:19,650
that's not the term that I would use

00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:21,400
here but I mean fair enough it's it's

00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:32,169
simply what we see

00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:34,540
and no I think the if you look there the

00:04:32,169 --> 00:04:36,970
it's not depth enough usually so the

00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,820
usual websites that have those those

00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:41,500
random groups it's around one specific

00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,690
product it's usually just in one

00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,250
direction you barely can influence what

00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:47,650
is happening at just the consumer end

00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,750
and in a true open source code you can

00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,340
influence you can take a role so if I'm

00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,440
on that website off the washing powder I

00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,330
usually can't influence the marketing if

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,580
I'm in an open-source project I have in

00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:00,039
an ideal world at least much higher

00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,510
chances to do that so yes you got

00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:03,490
Armando specifically but you're on the

00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:11,139
on the receiving end you cannot be a

00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:13,720
crater it's it's a broader finition

00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:15,400
indeed and there are many more and I

00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,310
think you always exclude something or

00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,990
someone so I haven't yet found a proper

00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,310
definition that that's why I said you

00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,289
only interviews you get a lot of great

00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:27,370
ideas and I'd like to combine all of

00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:29,560
these in one big sentence but if anybody

00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,240
has a better better definition I'd like

00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,620
to hear that it's not so trivial

00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,740
actually I agree

00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:38,020
you could base that on two or match that

00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:41,470
with the definition but that the sense

00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:43,960
behind that you can be enabled you can

00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:46,330
take part which we will see is missing

00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,010
from that so it is some sort of

00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:53,229
community but not what I have in mind

00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:55,900
put out at least when you think about

00:05:53,229 --> 00:05:57,970
how is that organized it's it's some

00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,400
sort of creative chaos so many many

00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:02,349
years ago I think could could be fifteen

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,539
years back in the open hours or project

00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:06,970
we tried indeed to paint a picture of a

00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:09,639
community and in the end we ended up

00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:11,440
with an anthill you have all those ants

00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,270
running in different directions and it

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:17,169
looks super chaotic in the end something

00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:20,139
comes out of that but per se there is

00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:22,360
not so much structure and this is what

00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:24,550
many projects these days organize did

00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,289
you have some more structure some more

00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:30,849
leadership some more goals that you

00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:32,919
share some more identity and we had two

00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:34,930
people it gets even more exciting which

00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:37,300
of course with my background is a is a

00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:39,370
of what I want to tell you is when you

00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,259
have an organization involved be it a

00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,460
commercial entity be it like what the

00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:45,520
document foundation is a non-profit

00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:47,370
because all of a sudden apart from all

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,380
the human factors that you have a lot of

00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:52,660
organizational things come on top you

00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:54,940
have to deal with donations with funds

00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,860
and not having money is a problem but

00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,389
having money can also be a problem you

00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,919
need to deal with that you need to

00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:02,830
organize that you need to spend and

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,710
coordinate that you will in an

00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:09,099
organization have certain roles that

00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:10,539
could be a board that could be it was a

00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:14,500
reward it could be a treasurer that

00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:16,979
could be spokesperson and as such that

00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:19,780
is then subject to certain rules to

00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:22,810
election so there's a framework around

00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:24,699
that that people have to stick to and

00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:28,810
that can make things even more

00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:31,960
complicated the the separation or

00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:33,910
distinction between the rows here is not

00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,310
conclusive so for me

00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:38,530
former roles are those that you need to

00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:40,479
have that fill a formal role like in a

00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:43,539
non-profit you have a board you need to

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:46,270
have that then you often have more

00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:49,270
dynamic roles that could be people

00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:51,430
taking a certain role that is not

00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:53,800
formalized like being a marketing

00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,510
spokesperson but that differs you also

00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,970
have projects and organizations that

00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:59,710
have a dedicated role for that but there

00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:01,860
are more formalized straws that have

00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:06,009
other rules other regulations are

00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:08,860
structures and there are more flexible

00:08:06,009 --> 00:08:11,830
roles that can be rather easily awarded

00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:15,490
or are rather easily awarded then then

00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:19,180
others and what still holds true at

00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:21,280
least from the projects I know that we

00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,409
are always short on volunteer so if

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,050
you're not running away fast enough it's

00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:27,759
it's rather easy to get a certain roller

00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:29,620
to get a certain task assigned at least

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,409
you might not be immediately in a board

00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:35,050
but getting a certain task getting

00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:38,950
certain duties and some sort of role is

00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:43,250
rada happens rather quickly I think

00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:46,460
but then with taking some some more rows

00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:49,070
some more leadership in a project you

00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:50,840
also take over certain responsibilities

00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:53,750
and there are certain things to avoid

00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:56,300
and this is what I'm trying in the next

00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:58,460
slides to break down on on ten items

00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,500
that I identified that we learned that I

00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,810
personally learned over the last couple

00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:05,810
of years things that we ran into things

00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:07,940
that we had to deal with things that for

00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,800
us were God you experience might be a

00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:12,170
different one fair enough but there's

00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:15,110
some of the things that I could extract

00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:17,180
from so what has happened we are at a

00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:20,000
certain point why is that and and what

00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:23,870
could we have avoided what would we have

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,450
wished we have learned up front so the

00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:29,210
first thing especially if you are in an

00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:32,360
organization with a large group with a

00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:33,890
larger board it's usually not clear with

00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,980
whom you are running so it's not that

00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:40,220
you likely run for a board role and have

00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:42,320
like three people that you run with but

00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,360
it's an election so you might indeed end

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:47,330
up with someone you don't like you can

00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,800
hardly work with that's that's risk it's

00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,510
it's not different than in the company

00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,280
you might go to a department and there

00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:55,460
are people you get along with and people

00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:57,890
you don't get along with so what we have

00:09:55,460 --> 00:10:01,460
learned is that cooperation is essential

00:09:57,890 --> 00:10:04,940
and that needs to take place in a in a

00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:06,920
certain way I mean it all sounds trivial

00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:09,770
but for us it's always good to remind

00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:13,190
ourselves again of those those golden

00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:14,750
rules you need to communicate open and

00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,430
honestly especially if you are in a

00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:17,870
volunteer capacity and you don't see

00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:20,390
each other the same of us each day you

00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:22,970
work remotely then that is actually

00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:25,100
rather important transparency especially

00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:27,020
for a document foundation has one of the

00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,460
key things that we set up so

00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,500
transparency for us is very very

00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,210
important so the communication the

00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,370
cooperation should happen in that

00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:36,290
fashion

00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:38,270
don't underestimate effectiveness if you

00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:40,280
are just discussing for the sake of

00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:42,800
discussing you will first achieve

00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,270
nothing and second it is damn exhausting

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,790
and that's what happens frequently you

00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:48,770
just argue and discuss and it turns

00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:50,690
especially into email into a massive

00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:52,360
amount of messages that serve

00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:54,339
essentially no purpose

00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,890
just to you know we'll speak your soul

00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:59,290
free but it's not it's not productive so

00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:01,029
especially if you spend spare time you

00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:02,560
want to create something you want to see

00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:05,350
something and not just end up in in

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,790
pointless discussions it's not possible

00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:09,700
to avoid that completely we are all

00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:12,100
humans but I think it's wrong important

00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,899
thing to keep in mind that if you work

00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,000
in an effective way doll so in the end

00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:20,649
we'll give you more more pleasure module

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,079
and what you do then what I mentioned

00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:25,540
you can work or you can end up with

00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:28,089
people in a certain group with whom you

00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:30,550
might not get along immediately so you

00:11:28,089 --> 00:11:32,230
need to identify a few queue things that

00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:33,279
you have in common because if you work

00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:36,029
together you need to share something

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:39,610
otherwise it's rather pointless um

00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:42,519
talking about goals or a win or plans is

00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:45,070
important but the second step is of

00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:46,899
missing after all those great goals but

00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:49,480
who's gonna pursue them who is in charge

00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:51,610
who wears the Hat that does not

00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,459
necessarily mean doing everything

00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:57,310
yourself but checking driving it

00:11:54,459 --> 00:11:59,860
reporting it feeling mandated to to push

00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:01,420
a topic forward and that is key because

00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,579
the first step is easy we want to

00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:05,500
achieve the following things but who's

00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:07,600
gonna wear the hat on this and the

00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,430
second step is especially in the

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,320
beginning of a project of missing and

00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:15,519
can lead to some rather unpleasant

00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:18,010
experiences a key thing is also

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,360
different points of view it's normal and

00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:21,250
it's actually good to have different

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,410
points of view sometimes it's a bit like

00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:25,300
salt in the soup without it's not taste

00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,430
if it's too much it's horrible so you

00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:32,589
need to find a proper balance too to get

00:12:27,430 --> 00:12:34,620
along to align the views or to end up

00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:37,720
with something you can all share and

00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,490
more than once especially if you work

00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,649
with people from other countries from

00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:43,660
other cultures you will get a new

00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:45,430
perspective at some point and you will

00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,529
try to question yourself try to

00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:50,260
understand others and that in the end

00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:52,060
can lead to a much bigger choice then

00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,220
you had on your screen before because

00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:57,310
you you see something else you get some

00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:59,230
more input and in the beginning for us

00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,850
that was rather exhausting because we

00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:03,880
were already quite busy with what we

00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:05,730
were doing but then we learned to value

00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,430
and appreciate that more and more

00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:10,500
so I think it's really key and of course

00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:12,389
Janna would with certain compromises you

00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:16,740
need to find certain things you all

00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:18,899
share you want to work on and also goals

00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:21,000
they are not always exclusive you might

00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:23,399
have different goals sometimes they are

00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,360
simply exclusive but sometimes they are

00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:29,579
not and acknowledging that and trying to

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,529
sound out what is possible and what

00:13:29,579 --> 00:13:34,500
could actually work together quite well

00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:37,589
is also one of the errata challenging

00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:39,240
tasks I'd say and the picture I have if

00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:41,339
you play the game of rope pulling so you

00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,899
have actually people enjoying the same

00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:45,360
thing there even when two different

00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:47,730
sides in the game but some resistance is

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,040
important in the end it's important we

00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,540
have a great time together and even if

00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:54,600
you disagree on a couple of things

00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,670
that's fine but you should be able to

00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:01,560
play these the same sports that's that's

00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:06,060
important the second point I named it

00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:08,100
commitment because first you if if you

00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:11,339
are mandated with a more formal room

00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:13,889
with more responsibilities you get there

00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:15,899
because of your previous commitment but

00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:18,899
then it also means you have more

00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:21,269
commitment in the future that's pointed

00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:24,029
I find what important so of course

00:14:21,269 --> 00:14:25,589
sometimes there's just a way I concede

00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:30,720
and you take it fair enough

00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:32,730
but you likely will not get a certain

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,100
responsibility or appreciation of what

00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:37,440
you do if you haven't been seen before

00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,470
if you were not present acting as a

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,319
specific way recognized by people

00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:45,480
appreciated by people so usually it's an

00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:47,519
expression of trust or the explicit or

00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,100
implicit but that's something you should

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,680
make yourself clear sometimes fair

00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,630
enough there's just a seat free and

00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,930
people look for someone to fill that but

00:14:54,630 --> 00:15:03,000
more and more and and it's in a majority

00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:04,680
of of cases that you have a certain

00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,529
reputation a positive one and this is

00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,360
what you should make a self aware

00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:11,850
however what I think is rather important

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:15,269
to understand if like if you get elected

00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:17,100
into a board it is not only because you

00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:19,190
did a great job and now this is your

00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,290
mettle that you can aware and that's it

00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:23,840
no actually comes with a ton of other

00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:26,030
and additional work and what I want to

00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:28,040
emphasize this work can be completely

00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:30,320
unrelated from what you have done before

00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,700
so if you were a marketing if you were

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,710
an development and all of a sudden

00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:36,110
you're on the board maybe part of that

00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:37,970
role is oversight over these areas but

00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:40,820
you will have a ton of other work that

00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:43,970
is completely unrelated and so it's not

00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:46,100
just the laurels you get and you can

00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:47,840
wear proudly but there is more attached

00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,910
to it there did there are strings

00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:52,220
attached and this is what I think when

00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:54,410
people run for such a role especially in

00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:58,100
a large organization is really key to

00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:59,810
understand looking at the time that is

00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,040
required it's really hard to say it

00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:03,830
completely depends on the organization

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:08,210
what we did the document foundation is

00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:10,070
to estimate over a year what is so to

00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:12,860
speak the minimum amount of time you

00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:15,560
have to invest for a role and we ended

00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:17,270
up with like 15 to 20 working days that

00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:21,050
is quite a lot actually over the course

00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:23,660
of the year so it shouldn't he prevent

00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:25,370
you from running for a specific role but

00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:27,050
you should make yourself tedious more

00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:31,430
work coming on top that requires a

00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:34,150
certain commitment so why is that

00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:37,610
because variety sounds rather positive

00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:40,130
what I want to highlight is what could

00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:42,800
be a part of this this is now a slide

00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:45,050
that is rather specific for for formal

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,810
board but now imagine you have a mix of

00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:49,850
developers of QA people of marketeers of

00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:52,610
localizers of infrastructure people and

00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:55,010
it's all great but what you see here is

00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:56,690
a ton of the tasks that they might end

00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:58,870
up with dealing on a daily business or

00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:03,290
at least overseeing on a daily business

00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:05,449
so there is a lot of new information you

00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:06,860
might have to digest and we just seen

00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:08,630
that we just started with a new board at

00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,699
a document foundation usually I do the

00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:12,920
onboarding explaining a bit what's going

00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:14,990
on what are the areas and that list and

00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,420
that amount of emails we sent for the

00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:19,130
onboarding basically grows every two

00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:21,260
years when we have the new set of port

00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:23,209
running and it's really it's not getting

00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:26,689
easier I mean we have new regulations we

00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:29,750
have new issues and what can be

00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:32,210
frustrating is that while all of them is

00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:33,160
required it's barely visible in public

00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:35,290
it's nothing they

00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,880
it's like makes you a rock star you walk

00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:39,610
on a red carpet and people applaud for

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,520
that it's the the boring groundwork that

00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:45,940
needs to be done that is not really

00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,200
glamorous and that can be in the

00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,810
beginning of it frustrating when you

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,470
have a lot of work and people don't see

00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:54,790
what is going on but it heavily depends

00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:57,550
on the organization the size of

00:17:54,790 --> 00:18:01,540
organization obviously but this is what

00:17:57,550 --> 00:18:06,100
we learned and rather the hard way so to

00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:09,820
deal with all of that it's I think basic

00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:11,860
knowledge to be able to learn you you

00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:13,960
should be open you cannot have all of

00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:16,540
that completely on your table and be

00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,220
completely sophisticated in all of the

00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,140
areas that's completely impossible I

00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:23,020
mean everybody has their special areas

00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:25,600
of interest but you need to get a bit of

00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:27,430
inside how these kind of things work you

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,820
need to be open there must be some

00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:32,500
tolerance to frustration the onboarding

00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:35,620
is not so easy it's a steep learning

00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,690
curve this is what you should keep in

00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:40,360
mind when when dealing with that and

00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:42,760
then if you are in a larger group

00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:45,010
usually people have different skills you

00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,290
should identify this and make use of

00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:48,880
that because if you end up doing

00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:51,100
everything your servant you might have

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,990
an accountant in your group or an IT guy

00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,880
let them do the job that they are

00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:57,040
actually skilled with and I mean it

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,740
sounds stupid but we identified that

00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,600
each time when we go to the the list of

00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:03,850
people taking care of certain areas if

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,800
you ask them so what's your your

00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:08,590
interest why are you skilled people are

00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:10,750
usually shy so they can tell you in my

00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:13,330
day job I work in an office and I do

00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:15,280
accounting but if as a hobby day I don't

00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:16,540
know I'd like to write texts there might

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,520
be it might be good for the marketing

00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:20,410
area and sounding that out that they are

00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:22,150
brave enough to bring it up and say hey

00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,620
ever interested in that area this is

00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:26,200
something I really feel comfortable with

00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:28,060
it's not as trivial as it may sound

00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:29,980
because people usually don't run up

00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,690
front and say yeah I'm great here and

00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:35,710
I'm great yet they are usually rather

00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:37,660
shy it's a bit of kind C of shaking head

00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:39,070
so a bit of kind of personality but at

00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:41,560
least it's the experience that we made

00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:44,260
it at least there is a certain amount of

00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:45,940
people rather reluctant to like waving

00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,360
the flag and hey Here I am and this is

00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:49,630
my

00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:51,250
so sounded out to distribute the tasks

00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:53,100
and responsibilities accordingly I think

00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:55,390
that's rather important and again

00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:58,269
responsibilities who is responsible for

00:19:55,390 --> 00:20:00,640
what this will likely help you a lot to

00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:05,320
to get all the influx of tasks done

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:08,260
properly and then at some point this is

00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:09,159
what I call delegation its delegation it

00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,380
doesn't scale anymore

00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:15,130
you need to have others in the board to

00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:17,950
help you out and I know those kind of

00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:19,750
people who like to work long at night

00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:22,059
and do everything by yourself to be

00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,740
super competent but actually if you

00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:25,630
delegate it's not a sign of weakness

00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:28,450
it's a sign of strength you need to

00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:30,100
delegate it's impossible in a mid to

00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:32,470
large organisation to handle everything

00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:34,299
yourself that just doesn't fly unless

00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:37,960
you completely stop sleeping but that

00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:39,700
has other unpleasant side effects so you

00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,909
can outsource to colleagues to other

00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:46,210
volunteers you might have employees they

00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:48,279
are service providers and you can share

00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:50,139
the tasks and they're the classical

00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:52,269
areas as soon as there is some money

00:20:50,139 --> 00:20:54,789
there are some resources what you want

00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:59,380
to outsource unlikely these these four

00:20:54,789 --> 00:21:01,659
areas and IT is a bit depends on the on

00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:03,250
the area you are active so if you have

00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:05,889
the skills in-house you might want to do

00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:08,200
it in-house if you don't it's one of the

00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:11,590
things to to first also as I guess but

00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:13,750
all IDI really and sorry for everybody

00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:15,730
who is in that field but I think the

00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,320
fields are simply boring nobody really

00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:20,049
wants to do in their spare time

00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:21,340
accounting and and administrative stuff

00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:23,320
so this is something you'll likely want

00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:25,510
to outsource in the beginning to really

00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:29,710
have you had free for other important

00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:33,010
bits and pieces that's exactly the

00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:36,610
message try to get as soon as you can

00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:39,490
rid of smaller tasks of things to the

00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:41,440
Neue of micromanaging things that not

00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:44,769
only sucks but also only sucks a lot of

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,960
time if you are in a more leadership

00:21:44,769 --> 00:21:48,880
role if you are there to guide people if

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,029
if you want to run the show

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,620
then you goal is really strategy long

00:21:52,029 --> 00:21:55,540
term goals

00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:57,010
a vision where do we want to go where do

00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:59,110
we want to be in two or three years and

00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:02,250
not dealing with a day-to-day business

00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:04,480
that is that is not working out and

00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,620
responsibilities is actually the next

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,420
slide but you have a certain

00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:10,780
responsibility all of a sudden that you

00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:13,510
need to follow and that doesn't fly so

00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:16,240
well but all the small things that can

00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:18,280
easily take up your full working day so

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:22,780
what you need to do with all the tasks

00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:25,150
is to be in a position to control what

00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:27,250
people working with you or for you are

00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:30,670
delivering but you can't be expert in

00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:34,360
all of these and we've seen a lot of

00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:35,890
times that oversight is important but

00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:37,679
you can't go deep it's it's simply

00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:42,610
impossible after a certain amount of

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:45,340
size and one of the things especially in

00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:48,400
those boring or unknown areas like

00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:50,260
administration Texas and all the needle

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,679
topics that can surround a project these

00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:55,240
days just because it's not your prime

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,740
topic and you're not skilled in it it

00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,780
does not mean it's not important and

00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,790
especially for those delivering on the

00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:03,100
tasks if the perception is always like

00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:06,100
it's not appreciated it's not relevant

00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,420
that can be quite annoying so keep in

00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,460
mind that even topics you have

00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:11,620
absolutely no idea of might be of

00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:15,360
critical relevance for the organization

00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:15,360
that is simply simply key

00:23:15,809 --> 00:23:21,190
responsibilities is and with that we are

00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:25,630
already halfway true is the fifth item I

00:23:21,190 --> 00:23:27,970
like to talk about so if you are in an

00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:29,650
organization of course this this maybe

00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:32,800
larger group there's a board or a

00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:34,929
supervisory board or any entity anybody

00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:36,670
you are part of it might be easy to hide

00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:39,670
and say yeah but we are like 10 people

00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:42,610
here we are five people or it's the big

00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:44,440
membership or whatever in the end if if

00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:46,929
you have been mandated for a specific

00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,670
task you simply have a personal

00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:50,920
responsibility maybe not in a legal

00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:54,100
sense but at least morally ethically

00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:58,390
towards those who who gave you trust so

00:23:54,100 --> 00:24:01,120
in the end you need to be on the safe

00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:03,880
side you need to be fine with yourself

00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,460
at what you're doing and

00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,950
with all the tasks and duties just to

00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:11,620
repeat what I said before try to keep an

00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:13,150
overview what's relevant you cannot be

00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:15,190
in all of the areas it cannot cover

00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:17,350
marketing development QA localization

00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:19,000
it's impossible doesn't scale but keep

00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:22,960
an overview what is cooking there what

00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:25,360
might be pressing points meet deadlines

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,340
they are simply for for legal entities

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,870
hard deadlines that you have to meet

00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:32,799
there is no way around there's no

00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:34,990
discussion regulations they get more and

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:37,120
more complicated I mean we just had this

00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:39,460
this GDP on topic behind us

00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,730
there is many many more things to come

00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:44,740
I'm sure beyond Dadd taxes and the basic

00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:46,720
legal stuff I'm rather sure we will see

00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:48,820
more things that will take our time and

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,950
we'll take our energy and are not

00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:53,650
directly related to the core thing that

00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:55,030
any project wants to do but we have to

00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:58,360
deal with that it will not get easier

00:24:55,030 --> 00:25:00,580
that's I think that's for sure and we

00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,890
had the the interesting experience last

00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:05,169
year think of us with the changes in

00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:07,330
copyright and they are always errors

00:25:05,169 --> 00:25:09,039
there can be a massive problem for for

00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:10,840
any project especially if it's

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:13,030
distributed worldwide so keep that in

00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,830
mind that is not important and again

00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:16,750
just because you don't know the topic

00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:19,419
does not mean it's not important it

00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:24,210
might be not important but it's not a

00:25:19,419 --> 00:25:24,210
given so that's something to be aware of

00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:30,250
then if we talk about project made up of

00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:32,380
people of course there's a massive

00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:35,200
social component that's that scares like

00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:37,539
in any company and I think with free

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,820
software projects worldwide lots of

00:25:37,539 --> 00:25:41,950
volunteers different people that

00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:44,559
actually is one of the more challenging

00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:46,690
ones and one of those who really can

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:49,020
determine where things are going beyond

00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:52,780
the ground work you need to provide

00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:55,740
working together in a in a team and have

00:25:52,780 --> 00:26:00,400
a certain sort of responsibility is

00:25:55,740 --> 00:26:02,409
really really key so you might have and

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,210
this is what also we discovered over the

00:26:02,409 --> 00:26:06,070
course of time you have your tasks and

00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:07,929
projects but at some point in time you

00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:09,970
might be large enough did you have a

00:26:07,929 --> 00:26:12,190
paid team and then you run into the

00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:14,440
problem that like in many organizations

00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:17,440
you have a pro bono board do we let

00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:20,110
India spare time maybe not have

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,600
need a business based on guiding people

00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:24,639
on handling employees on the other hand

00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,320
you have a set of eight contractor speed

00:26:24,639 --> 00:26:29,049
employees people depending on the

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,269
organization and that changes the game

00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:33,519
quite significantly because all of a

00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:35,860
sudden you might simply end up in being

00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:37,539
an employer it's no different from a

00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,820
small local Association that maybe

00:26:37,539 --> 00:26:43,000
employs one or two people you take over

00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:44,590
the leadership there and then you are

00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,659
the employer if you like it or not you

00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:49,120
might be employed yourself in in your

00:26:46,659 --> 00:26:51,220
professional life but you also have that

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:55,450
responsibility of the employer and that

00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:58,059
can change things quite a lot so I don't

00:26:55,450 --> 00:27:00,399
want to deliver a lecture on like how to

00:26:58,059 --> 00:27:03,039
handle staff there are tons of people

00:27:00,399 --> 00:27:06,159
who've written great books about that

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:08,919
but the basic two things I think are

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,929
especially in a volatile environment or

00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:14,070
a changing environment like the

00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:16,509
communities is give them some safety and

00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:19,090
provide them a proper work environment a

00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:21,279
positive one it can't be all unicorns

00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:23,710
every day but try to provide some

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,539
positive work environment because that

00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:29,110
is key and that is really important for

00:27:25,539 --> 00:27:31,419
you it might be that site job or site

00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:33,549
activity you have an evening but for

00:27:31,419 --> 00:27:35,019
them it may be is their complete

00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:36,820
income stream their complete

00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:37,690
professional work life and that is

00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,220
simply a completely different

00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:43,990
perspective that you have to factor in

00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:46,029
and I think especially for a project you

00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:48,039
can actually make advantage of what you

00:27:46,029 --> 00:27:50,559
provide because people then indeed can

00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:52,840
work from home which is a key benefit

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,730
it's not so common still especially in

00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,950
Germany countries are different in that

00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:59,919
regard but it's a key thing you can

00:27:56,950 --> 00:28:02,080
advertise with they can turn what they

00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,659
like to do into their day job into a

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,549
living contribute you to something good

00:28:04,659 --> 00:28:08,889
to something positive not only earning

00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:10,750
money but actually moving something

00:28:08,889 --> 00:28:13,000
achieving something is something you can

00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:16,509
sell so when you write your job offers

00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,450
don't just have that the basic facts but

00:28:16,509 --> 00:28:21,340
advertise why why they should go with

00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:23,529
you what is the good thing you promote

00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:26,200
to the world and I mean as open-source

00:28:23,529 --> 00:28:27,700
communities we do have things that we

00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:29,679
want to give to the general public and

00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,650
therefore this is something you can

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,400
really use

00:28:30,650 --> 00:28:37,070
who advertise and make use of and shout

00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:39,080
out to the world if you contribute here

00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:42,830
if you join us actually you do something

00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:44,480
good and you can well make the world a

00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:45,950
better place that sort of a stupid tacky

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,600
but you know what I mean you can't

00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:52,340
actually contribute to to something good

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,600
asset it's really a steep learning curve

00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:56,150
especially when they do it in a

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,550
volunteer capacity especially with

00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:59,960
volunteer teams like many projects work

00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:02,300
with volunteer teams and that adds

00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:05,120
another layer of complexity because not

00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:08,300
everybody is immediately suited for

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,460
remote working from home not changing

00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:12,440
the location during the day might be a

00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:15,380
problem for some as we have learned so

00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:17,210
just listen it's basic knowledge talk

00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:19,610
with each other not about each other try

00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:21,110
to listen try to sound out especially if

00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:23,510
you don't see people in the office each

00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:26,540
day if they're working remotely if you

00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:28,580
only infrequently see them like some

00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:29,780
members of my team I meet four times a

00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,310
year because they are living on the

00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:33,740
complete opposite side of the world and

00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:35,510
then you need to really sound out what

00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:37,700
are they up to how are they doing how

00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:40,460
are they feeling and that is really

00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:42,740
really important that can earn you on

00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:45,080
the other hand a lot of motivation and

00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:47,090
loyalty and this is what we need if you

00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:49,370
invest in people if you build up a team

00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:51,320
and they run away after a year you have

00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:53,930
a problem you need to build it up again

00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:56,740
it costs your time it cost reputation so

00:29:53,930 --> 00:30:00,560
it's I think a pretty good investment to

00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:02,840
do that to spend time even if it's hard

00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:05,840
because it's not your daily job it's not

00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:07,370
what you are trained to do try to gather

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,260
some knowledge and how that works and

00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:12,170
simply be open I think that especially

00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:14,360
in a field that we are working in is one

00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:16,670
of the key competences we should have

00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:21,610
been open listening being open minded

00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:21,610
and as such do that also with your team

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,770
that brings me

00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:30,300
the topic of diversity and this is the

00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:33,330
larger the project gets the more

00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:35,160
exciting that becomes so we have looking

00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:37,410
at people who contribute to to

00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:41,120
LibreOffice we have such a broad range

00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:45,890
of people broad range of countries

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:49,440
backgrounds professions from students to

00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:53,460
people being retired we had from one of

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:55,410
my samples we had a doctor a leading

00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:57,450
doctor who was working in a field of

00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:59,940
graphics so completely unrelated to what

00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:01,950
he was doing in his day job and that was

00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:03,630
always a quiet for him it was a change

00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:07,320
he had a talent that area for me was a

00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:10,710
change to the Daedra and that's minute

00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:13,290
that's cool and it requires you to

00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:16,320
understand certain things so language of

00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:18,690
course is one one element which language

00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,570
do you speak or if you're a native

00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:24,090
English speaker at what speed do you

00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:27,060
speak it makes a difference can people

00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:29,430
follow meetings can you really bring

00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:31,800
across the content awesome easy words if

00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:33,090
you're on the same level that's fine but

00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,070
then you might have people who speak

00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:37,800
basic English and you speak fast and do

00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:39,450
super complicated words especially in

00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:43,470
meetings on the phone that might make a

00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:45,180
big problem culture yeah we have

00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:46,830
different cultural backgrounds we might

00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:50,010
like certain things we might dislike

00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:54,990
certain things and religion Percy I

00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:58,860
mentioned it is not a key element of the

00:31:54,990 --> 00:32:00,510
quanta Bouton's but it can like for for

00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:02,310
the food you have at conferences makes a

00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:04,260
difference or once we had our own

00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:05,790
conference people were asking is there a

00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,140
room where we can have prayers and we

00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:09,330
simply didn't have to don't scream but

00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,830
for them it was really important so the

00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:13,170
more people you have the more diversity

00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:15,300
is in the more you need to to learn

00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:16,950
understand and there are they're great

00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:19,680
things you learn that will also advance

00:32:16,950 --> 00:32:21,780
you personally at the beginning it might

00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:25,230
be a lot of new unknown topics that you

00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:28,440
have to face and then of course with all

00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:30,120
the great diversity let's face it you

00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:32,250
also have to deal with complicated

00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:34,320
persons that's like in daily life like

00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:36,570
in a job so it's not just all the nice

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,380
people gotta here you also have to face

00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:39,600
with complicate

00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:43,530
toxic people with people trying to do a

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:45,480
harm and my take is at the moment is

00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:47,280
this even going up in the community so I

00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,800
have a couple of communities I know of

00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:52,920
that really face problems at the moment

00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:54,600
might be coincidence but in general

00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:56,400
there are discussions they are

00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:01,710
complicated people you might need to

00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:04,850
address it's part of the game and I made

00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:09,210
the sample before of local associations

00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:11,100
the big difference for me is that much

00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:13,620
of that might hold true also for small

00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:15,780
local organization the big difference is

00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:17,790
that in an open source community you

00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:20,220
have people from around the world and

00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:22,350
that is rarely the case in a small local

00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:23,640
Association there might be some people

00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:25,470
from other countries but it's not this

00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:29,250
massive influx that you deal with people

00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:30,900
from 30 40 countries so the the level is

00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:32,790
much higher and the challenges are much

00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:34,740
higher but then what you can get in

00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:36,960
return is much higher as well if you

00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:39,120
have all those people in work together

00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:43,020
with them that can change the game quite

00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:44,940
a lot to your advantage and in the end

00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:46,500
the general advice you need to be open

00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,720
you need to challenge yourself you

00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:51,330
points of view might change or at least

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,790
you will learn a new point of view from

00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:56,610
others and you need to factor it in and

00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:58,920
I personally was really positively

00:33:56,610 --> 00:34:00,690
surprised a couple of times it's not

00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:02,070
always easy like at the conference so

00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:05,310
where's the room where we can pray and

00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:07,230
you're like ah okay just don't have to

00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:09,120
don't screen for the next conference you

00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:10,500
know you need to reach out and ask if

00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:12,090
there is such a demand you can fake it

00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,580
and you learn something that you will

00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:19,320
keep so it's it's a really helpful thing

00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:21,419
for my point of view speaking about

00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:23,879
languages maybe a bit more to the

00:34:21,419 --> 00:34:25,770
groundwork again on how to coordinate

00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:27,389
all that so we have projects we have

00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:30,450
people we have different feelings we

00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:32,690
have diversity but how does that more or

00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:35,940
less technical work technically work to

00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:39,030
coordinate everything and languages is

00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:40,230
key we all assume English as a language

00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:42,570
spoken everywhere

00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:44,610
I might object to that there are

00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:46,440
countries where English is not so

00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:48,270
prominent where other languages are much

00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,710
more prominence or the basic assumption

00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:53,290
everybody speaks English

00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:55,119
might not work out so be careful with

00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:57,849
that I have no no proper solution

00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:00,220
because if if you have a variety of

00:34:57,849 --> 00:35:02,260
countries and unity intact but then not

00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:04,270
all of us speak like five languages but

00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:06,430
this general assumption everybody speaks

00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:08,020
English is wrong it's simply wrong I

00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:09,369
don't want to name countries

00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:13,330
specifically but we have a couple of

00:35:09,369 --> 00:35:14,950
countries that simply told us so we have

00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:17,080
one or two people as a gateway otherwise

00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:20,980
English here is simply not resistant so

00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:22,869
be careful with that also brings the

00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:24,490
question if you have contracts if you

00:35:22,869 --> 00:35:26,410
have anything writing with people or any

00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:28,390
like which language would a code of

00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:31,000
conduct be in or which languages it's

00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:33,130
not so trivial it affected it in for us

00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,250
English is fine far as it might not so

00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:37,869
factor in more into that and then of

00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:39,369
course the practical things like time

00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:40,990
zones are great if you coordinated

00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:43,300
Australia or other countries you have a

00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:44,740
lot of fun daylight savings can be

00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:46,210
different so does this just at the

00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:50,080
practical think when the heck is our

00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:52,480
meeting at which time so keep that keep

00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:55,660
it in mind and then again talking about

00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:58,570
times working with the team and pro bono

00:35:55,660 --> 00:36:01,000
folks you have the problem I wasn't here

00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:04,180
can mostly do work outside business

00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,310
hours in evenings during weekends if you

00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:08,859
have a paid team if he asked him to be

00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:10,869
present like each weekend it's a kind of

00:36:08,859 --> 00:36:12,430
fly so you need to find some our balance

00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:16,660
how to match everything like that

00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:18,730
how can a team of pro bono and paid

00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:21,220
staff work together and find a meeting

00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:22,930
slot that is not disturbing their daily

00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:27,970
routine too much it's not so trivial

00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:30,369
actually there is to media it's my ideal

00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:32,950
scheduling a couple of things basic

00:36:30,369 --> 00:36:35,260
things but we learned it use polls

00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:38,980
alternate time slot so everybody at

00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:41,800
least has chance once to join a meeting

00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:43,390
and sent calendar why it's because then

00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:46,240
you have the proper time zone it's it's

00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:47,710
basic but we had issues several times

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,690
that people did not know when a meeting

00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:51,460
starts even if it's written and you had

00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:54,750
the time zone conversion send him a

00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,750
calendar invite it helps actually

00:36:54,840 --> 00:37:01,080
so how to communicate email is great I

00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,970
can read and reply whenever have time on

00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:06,150
the phone and it need to be present

00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:08,370
immediately but then at some point after

00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:10,200
the fifth hundred email it might be a

00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:12,240
problem to still follow discussion might

00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,120
be easier to take things on the phone so

00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,680
identify what is better on a phone

00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:20,490
identify what is better in email or chat

00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:23,820
or whatever written conversation and for

00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:27,240
emails we learned if people have too

00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:30,390
many emails and who does not tech the

00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:32,280
emails like urgent vote discussion info

00:37:30,390 --> 00:37:35,480
so we can presort a bit that actually

00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:38,700
helps a lot and in general it's

00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:40,860
absolutely fine to prepare a vote in

00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:43,110
email and conduct via phone or the other

00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:45,030
way discussion discuss a controversial

00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:47,250
topic on the phone and have two final

00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:49,410
vote by email so you are not bound to

00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:52,110
one media continuously over the life

00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:55,110
cycle of a topic see what what's better

00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:56,970
and then you need depending on the

00:37:55,110 --> 00:38:00,000
organization you might have to meet a

00:37:56,970 --> 00:38:01,680
deadline agenda quorum Factor didn't for

00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,180
some its relaxed if you like an

00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,800
association in Germany you have to

00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,870
reduce how that has to happen so you

00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,190
need to agree internally when is our

00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:09,810
meeting deadlines when do we send the

00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:12,230
agenda out otherwise what you decide

00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:18,510
might be simply void and everything was

00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:22,110
wasted time Trust trust sounds easy but

00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:25,320
it is not I'd say so

00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:27,210
at least after a certain amount of time

00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:29,310
if you're in a row and you still don't

00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:32,580
have trust in others or you still don't

00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:35,670
feel trusted you either run away or you

00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:39,900
don't fill the role properly so Trust is

00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:41,940
important written communication is risky

00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,290
because you don't see the other side

00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:45,660
everybody has a different style of

00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:47,700
writing and like once I had a colleague

00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:49,500
who was always - a long a nice email

00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,870
replying one sentence and it's like

00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:54,900
don't you like me would do we disagree

00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:56,370
then he told me no no so I'm working at

00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,870
this company and whenever my boss is out

00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:59,790
of the room I have like 10 seconds to

00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:02,070
reply to that email and then it was

00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:04,470
clear but before that what an arse but

00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:06,720
then it was completely different he

00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:08,670
really wanted to reply he even like

00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,779
risked a debate with his boss too

00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:11,099
to my email it was a completely

00:39:09,779 --> 00:39:13,799
different context but you need to know

00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:16,859
that a simple email a couple of lines of

00:39:13,799 --> 00:39:18,359
text are really risky to to be

00:39:16,859 --> 00:39:21,660
interpreted and then we all have the

00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:23,160
confirmation bias we all assume that the

00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:27,329
bad feelings we had before are now

00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:29,579
confirmed so talk with people try to get

00:39:27,329 --> 00:39:32,490
into exchange trust people try to build

00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:34,260
trust that is that is key because after

00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:36,869
a certain amount of time it will be a

00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:38,579
long time be in silence and you will not

00:39:36,869 --> 00:39:40,019
discuss about it but there will be a

00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:41,549
point that everything will pop up and

00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:43,440
like the pain of the last five years

00:39:41,549 --> 00:39:45,450
will really break out and that's what

00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,920
you really want to avoid it takes time

00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:51,839
energy and it's just not leading

00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:53,490
anywhere and then that's what we learned

00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,960
being based in Germany and having people

00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:57,510
worldwide if you have a different legal

00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,089
setting that can lead to some funny and

00:39:57,510 --> 00:40:03,539
obscure things because if somebody from

00:40:00,089 --> 00:40:05,490
the US or from the UK looks at Germany

00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:08,339
or the other way around there is a ton

00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:10,680
of questions and that also might lead to

00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:13,559
to trust issues so try to have a

00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:15,299
complicated it is try to translate try

00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:17,549
to explain what is going on what the

00:40:15,299 --> 00:40:19,500
rules are why there are rules so they

00:40:17,549 --> 00:40:21,930
have a fair chance of getting on board

00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:27,119
and understanding it the languages is

00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:29,849
not a barrier to that class but maybe

00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:33,809
most important reward reward is

00:40:29,849 --> 00:40:35,970
important and the next and last slide is

00:40:33,809 --> 00:40:38,940
simply my my very personal list I think

00:40:35,970 --> 00:40:41,279
everybody has their lists of why they

00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:44,190
feel rewarded or what makes them feel

00:40:41,279 --> 00:40:47,700
rewarded what I'd like to see there the

00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:49,019
group of people would simply like to go

00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,609
to a big corporation and at the end of

00:40:49,019 --> 00:40:52,230
the month of a massive paycheck and then

00:40:50,609 --> 00:40:54,750
just spend time at weekends and

00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:56,549
vacations others have completely

00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:59,569
different desires and you should

00:40:56,549 --> 00:41:03,180
identify if you're active in a project

00:40:59,569 --> 00:41:05,910
what your personal reward is and also

00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:08,190
what you want others to see as a reward

00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:11,250
like appreciation if you want to be

00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:13,109
appreciated appreciate honors if you

00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:15,329
want to lot them if you want to help

00:41:13,109 --> 00:41:19,559
them achieve a new level at their day

00:41:15,329 --> 00:41:22,080
job do that so try to find out why

00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:25,050
somebody is running

00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:27,120
for a role try to find out what makes

00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:30,300
people comfortable in contributing what

00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:31,980
they are desired reward is and try to

00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:35,280
give it to them everybody has their very

00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:36,570
own list of things what they are really

00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:39,030
comfortable with what they really would

00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:40,860
like to see try to find it out and also

00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:43,890
important answer this question for

00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:47,940
yourself in order to to keep you happy

00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:49,680
and engaged in the long run so let's

00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:53,430
that was really did the condensed

00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:56,520
version that all originated I think two

00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:57,960
years ago when we had a new board coming

00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:00,000
up and the question was can you

00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:03,420
summarize a bit of what we had as

00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,700
experiences and it's clearly very

00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,230
subjective it's my own takes and and

00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:10,140
feelings u.s. might be completely

00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:12,330
different but I'd like to simply give it

00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:13,830
to you as some sort of inspiration it

00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:15,540
depends on the setting and the

00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:17,040
organization to size and the kind of

00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:19,830
people fair enough

00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:22,970
but I hope it was a bit useful I'm happy

00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:25,770
for questions feel free to poke me and

00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:27,670
yeah thanks for your patience and thanks

00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:31,810
for listening

00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:34,150
[Music]

00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:39,730
thank you thank you for that talk does

00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:42,910
anyone have any questions thank you for

00:42:39,730 --> 00:42:45,820
your talk I'd like to go back to the

00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:47,800
very beginning when you had a definition

00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:49,930
of a community and I realized that you

00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:55,360
might not be as attached to it as you

00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:56,860
know it's presented but the way you know

00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:59,260
the way it's presented it might be more

00:42:56,860 --> 00:43:02,470
descriptive than prescriptive but I

00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:05,340
wonder if there is a way to hack it that

00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:07,780
would change things a little bit so can

00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:09,820
yes thank you a group of people with the

00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:13,300
shared identity and joint interests I

00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:16,660
wonder if one way to present it is

00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:20,260
something like a shared shared values

00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:22,750
and common goals and here's why

00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:24,790
a lot of what I do is trying to bring

00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:27,520
designers into this space and it's

00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:29,380
really difficult when an identity is

00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,970
defined in terms of common memories

00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:32,650
ventures and experiences because

00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:35,350
sometimes they're just not shared right

00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:36,400
sometimes it's very alienating when

00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:38,290
you're referring that to some

00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,810
conferences you've been to years ago or

00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:42,040
there is a very obscure Star Trek

00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:44,920
reference somewhere you know like

00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:49,480
there's just ways in which a shared

00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:51,250
identity could be very exclusive and so

00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:52,900
I wonder like if instead of saying

00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:55,390
shared identity maybe there is a better

00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:58,150
way to present it as shared values like

00:43:55,390 --> 00:44:00,520
valleys we all hold and similar to

00:43:58,150 --> 00:44:03,400
interests when you call it an interest

00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:05,680
it's often you know oh we our interest

00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:07,090
is building local for software or

00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:08,500
something you know some something you

00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:10,900
know that people can have fun doing

00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,520
together but often times that means that

00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:14,950
you are only going to reach developers

00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:17,640
in that sense if you make it a common

00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:20,590
goal say something like our goal is to

00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:23,050
you know destroy tech monopolies or

00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:24,910
something like that you might find that

00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:26,860
designers are also interested in

00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:28,810
participating and even lawyers in the

00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:30,250
Countians right like you know that the

00:44:28,810 --> 00:44:32,530
people could be the group could be much

00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:34,480
more diverse than just developers and so

00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:35,890
yeah I guess I don't know if this is

00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,980
more of a question or a comment but like

00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:41,260
is there a way to hack the definition to

00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:43,750
make it a little bit more inclusive to

00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:45,490
different groups of people I absolutely

00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:48,160
like the idea so it's

00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:50,230
really not easy when when I was starting

00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:52,750
to talk of us as you see in the end

00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:54,460
ending up at Wikipedia because I liked

00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:56,080
that I was not able to come up with

00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:59,170
something really descriptive or really

00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:01,780
that that felt like yep that's it myself

00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:03,430
I like vision you could use also passion

00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:04,869
it's maybe a bit too strong depends on

00:45:03,430 --> 00:45:06,460
the kind of people you address but I

00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:08,680
know some in our group who are really

00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:10,270
passionate who really like they they

00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:14,800
have that flame they really like to do

00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:17,350
that and so everything that is emotional

00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,930
any any anything that is in an emotional

00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:21,820
sense getting there is something I like

00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:23,260
there are other people who see it more

00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:25,869
technical and that that's fair enough

00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:27,160
but it is this when I might as some

00:45:25,869 --> 00:45:28,510
would have two friends from school is

00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,460
this emotional binding they have

00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:32,140
something you share whatever it's called

00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:34,900
so vision sounds great to me

00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:50,590
I like their approach am indeed indeed

00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:52,390
thanks about leadership and especially

00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:54,340
when you have a group of volunteers

00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:56,470
maybe not like full timers or paid

00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:58,510
people like you just also have to do

00:45:56,470 --> 00:46:01,600
difficult things like in the companies

00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:03,850
I've done like letting people go like

00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:05,859
what's the equivalent where or did you

00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:07,540
ever run two into a situation where he

00:46:05,859 --> 00:46:10,540
actually has somebody in your community

00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:13,500
where you said well we actually don't

00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:16,660
want to work with you anymore

00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:18,280
so luckily we never had to go that far

00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:20,920
we were always close to like really

00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:23,440
talking to people saying your behavior

00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:26,140
or how we approach the other person is

00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:30,369
not appropriate so at least I'm not

00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:32,260
aware of a major issue luckily but my

00:46:30,369 --> 00:46:33,910
take unfortunately is it was just not

00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:35,290
discovered I can't imagine after that

00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:38,290
amount of time with that group of people

00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:39,700
nothing ever happened so that's why one

00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:42,040
and I'm happy on that and I'm sure there

00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:43,690
was something but at least we have

00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:46,330
complicated times we have to talk to

00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:48,580
people and it gets even more complicated

00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:50,230
if they are friends and and you know you

00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:52,300
have those those two heads and one and

00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:53,740
that like so what's happening here is

00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:56,380
simply not gonna work out on the other

00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:58,140
end like I'm a friend of you so what the

00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:01,950
heck is going on

00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:05,309
and that is not so easy what we usually

00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:07,589
do is trying to find our to sound out

00:47:05,309 --> 00:47:09,809
who is probably best in a project a

00:47:07,589 --> 00:47:12,119
person who speaks the same language or

00:47:09,809 --> 00:47:14,460
who is you know the same mindset whom

00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:17,119
would they trust that helps a lot it's

00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:22,010
not always smooth and easy of course

00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:25,970
that's the way we try to handle it and

00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:30,690
we do have complicated people on various

00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:33,420
occasions of course but we try for

00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:37,920
example when when when when there are

00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:41,039
people known to run around and annoy

00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:42,660
people to say very friendly to make here

00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:44,309
so if there's a problem here's a couple

00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:45,930
of trusted people you can contact maybe

00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:49,650
not in a code of conduct sense but like

00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:51,779
if that person pops up I know them quite

00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:53,730
well please poke I'm happy to talk don't

00:47:51,779 --> 00:47:56,190
don't try to get into that warm I'm

00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:58,740
happy to to call and and and and solve

00:47:56,190 --> 00:48:00,990
the problem or talk to them so this is

00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:03,599
some sort of I'd say internal knowledge

00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:05,010
that we have but of course is risky if

00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:08,010
some people leave Danette knowledge has

00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:10,980
gone but that's how we at the moment try

00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:12,960
to address it but we're eager to improve

00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:15,359
on that as well so code of conduct is

00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:18,000
one of the topics that we have fun but

00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:21,599
their discussions to improve on that I

00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:25,410
think this is key the more communities

00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:26,789
grow the more they include people who

00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:29,160
are simply different from the core group

00:48:26,789 --> 00:48:32,250
that the more important that is I think

00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:33,690
and but as you can imagine and maybe

00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:42,900
some of you went to that it's not an

00:48:33,690 --> 00:48:45,510
easy discussion at all thank you for the

00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:47,849
talk my question also goes into a

00:48:45,510 --> 00:48:51,750
similar direction I think as as your

00:48:47,849 --> 00:48:55,260
question when you define diversity you

00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:57,119
mentioned like different people in

00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:59,220
different jobs different age different

00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:03,809
culture but you didn't mention for

00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:05,880
example like gender for example which no

00:49:03,809 --> 00:49:07,980
no worries about that but I was just

00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:10,559
curious because I read a

00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:12,990
right on Twitter the other day that well

00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:15,869
the amount of for example women in tech

00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:17,640
is much lower than men but it's even

00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:21,030
much much much lower a lot fewer

00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:23,819
percentage the relationship is like more

00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:26,549
off in an open source where there are

00:49:23,819 --> 00:49:29,549
very few women so I was just curious do

00:49:26,549 --> 00:49:31,500
you have it's a tough question but do

00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:33,900
you have an explanation for that

00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:36,079
and what you think could could a

00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:39,540
community do to address this issue

00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:40,710
yeah so indeed the debt list is also

00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:42,660
most conclusive it wasn't made on

00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:45,569
purpose because with that you open a

00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:47,609
really massive discussions that I really

00:49:45,569 --> 00:49:53,579
don't have proper answers for I share

00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:56,430
your findings what we did is to discuss

00:49:53,579 --> 00:49:59,609
that we had a workshop to conferences

00:49:56,430 --> 00:50:04,200
ago to how to improve it it's a very

00:49:59,609 --> 00:50:05,990
small first step obviously and it's not

00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:08,520
a trivial topic it's a very heated

00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:12,660
emotional topic and that these are

00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:15,359
always really really pragmatic to to to

00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:17,160
talk to I have not a real explanation I

00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:20,130
perceived the same if you mean if we

00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:22,109
look at our board if you look at our

00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:26,010
membership base it's easy if you look at

00:50:22,109 --> 00:50:28,710
the gender the the percentages is clear

00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:32,910
it's exactly what you say we see it with

00:50:28,710 --> 00:50:36,329
the conference's we we try our first

00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:39,869
steps that I would say to to improve we

00:50:36,329 --> 00:50:42,630
could do clearly much better but then it

00:50:39,869 --> 00:50:44,160
really is a question how to to work on

00:50:42,630 --> 00:50:47,250
that so also the opinions they are

00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:51,599
different and I think it's so fragile if

00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:53,790
if you move in a in a at least public in

00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:55,859
a certain direction you might break this

00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:58,470
i'm i don't know it i perceived

00:50:55,859 --> 00:51:00,030
everybody is really careful fully aware

00:50:58,470 --> 00:51:02,339
of the problem clear we should solve

00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:04,140
that and luckily we do have a couple of

00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:05,880
really dedicated and passionate people

00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:08,520
driving that and I hope to see much more

00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:11,400
calm because we perceived the same and I

00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:14,490
certainly have no no perfect answer as

00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:17,480
to why we see that and and how to solve

00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:20,720
that I I hear many opinions but I

00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:22,310
I can't combine all of them to one they

00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:24,230
are they are different that makes it a

00:51:22,310 --> 00:51:26,260
bit trivial if everybody is going the

00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:29,030
same direction it's easy if you have

00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:31,010
opposing opinions then it's prom attic

00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:32,570
and I'm not the expert in that feeling

00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:37,090
that makes it really challenging you

00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:37,090
have to say but I'm willing to learn any

00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:49,570
any more questions okay thank you

00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:57,070
[Applause]
