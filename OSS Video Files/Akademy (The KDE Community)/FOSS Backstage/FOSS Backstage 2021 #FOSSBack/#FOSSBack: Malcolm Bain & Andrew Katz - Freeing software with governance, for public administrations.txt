Title: #FOSSBack: Malcolm Bain & Andrew Katz - Freeing software with governance, for public administrations
Publication date: 2021-02-25
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Public Money, Public Code… but what are the best practices for public sector bodies to release new projects or share their own projects as FOSS? Why is it not "easy-peasy" (it certainly should be a "no-brainer")? Public sector bodies usually don’t have the staff with FOSS skills (certainly at management level, although they increasingly have developers who do, and are keen to embrace FOSS), they don’t have the time, and it is not a priority… even if there is a legal mandate. Two veteran open source lawyers present their experience in working with two public sector projects in the UK and Spain respectively, for publicly sharing code, with two totally different approaches looking for short term wins and long term sustainability. Governance? Contributions? Community Principles? High level inter-administration agreements? IP Management? Resources and funding? Navigating internal management?

You name, we have … no answers but maybe some hints that will help you work with local governments for freeing up public code.

	00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,480
so

00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,400
legal legal but not too legal let's say

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,000
that this one actually isn't is not

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,519
it's not about licenses for once it's

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,960
not about licenses

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,960
or a little bit a little bit we can't

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,320
avoid that um

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,920
do you want me to kind of like present

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,720
what we're going to do andrew and then

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,880
you take over

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,840
or um yeah well that that would be great

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,119
if you want to um

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,400
i was going to try to do everything i

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,199
possibly could to avoid having to

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,640
pronounce

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:30,320
sanford but i can't just try to

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,519
pronounce it so i will let you

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,440
yeah give us a little background about

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,440
that okay okay yeah

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,680
so so what we're talking about actually

00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,879
is managing um governance and issues and

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,920
sustainability

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,120
in open source uh projects which are run

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,960
or initiated by the public

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,200
administration and

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,640
um i think most of us know about how

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,320
it's run in the private sector or by

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,160
individuals in universities

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,920
and the public sector has has some

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,960
issues um which make it a little bit

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,480
more complex

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,440
uh it makes it more exciting because i

00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,160
think there's a there's a greater

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,719
achievement

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,559
to be done there but um the public

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,479
sector does have rules about how they

00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,240
can operate and how they can work

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,400
these vary from country to country which

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,040
is why it's interesting to contrast

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,320
my experience in spain and andrew's

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,159
experience in

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,280
um in the uk um just to say we are both

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,880
lawyers we're both

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,880
i would say open source lawyers we've

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,000
been working in the sector now for

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,520
way too long as you can see um but

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,200
um and um but it's it's uh one of my

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,200
i like working with open sources it's

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,799
it's enjoyable it's challenging

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,200
uh and there's always new things to do

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,200
and at the moment i think public sector

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,439
uh open source is is one of the really

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,320
uh areas where things are happening

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,119
and things can happen better if we can

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,600
achieve

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,520
um greater ways of freeing and using

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,240
open source public open source

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,119
and and achieving sustainability in

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,720
their um

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,159
in these projects so basically the

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,479
presentation today is about

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,079
uh two projects um working on uh well

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,960
actually i've got two so it's three

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,360
it's two on my side one on andy's side

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,479
uh

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,280
looking at how um open source was

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,680
approached

00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,479
by our um respective clients in this

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,879
respect

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,800
um two cities uh why it's this is why

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,800
it's a tale of two cities

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,520
uh some philippe de jobregat i got that

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,560
one right uh on my side and croydon

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,680
on uh for andy okay so just just very

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,680
briefly uh

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,000
sanfilio is a suburb of barcelona where

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,120
i live uh barcelona is obviously very

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,879
open source it's got

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,879
loads loads of projects it's got an open

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,519
technologies uh plan

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,560
it's got loads of stuff and um the

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,720
cities around

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,720
barcelona are actually working in this

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,599
ecosystem and building stuff and sharing

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,920
things

00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,879
um it's also part of the province the

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,440
province has a

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,560
regional government with a smart region

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,360
initiative

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,879
which is fully open based the the people

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,959
working on the smart region

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,120
uh are very much in favor of open source

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,319
so we're in a context where actually

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,159
which is quite positive

00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,760
it's a small town um not very many

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,640
people probably about fifty thousand

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,560
people in

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:06,000
in in in inhabitants that the

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,000
i.t departments are very small to eight

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
people working working there

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,239
and but as i said they're working

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,720
towards this open administration and and

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,159
in spain at least in catalonia open

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,640
administration means

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,680
digital open openly digital digitally

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,920
open

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,680
um and and i will be presenting a couple

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,040
of projects we're working with

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,799
to free uh the software and create some

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,200
community around these projects

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,239
over to you andrew yeah great thanks um

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,319
so if you ask

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,000
uh people from croydon about croydon

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,799
they will say that croydon um

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,599
is a small town in surrey um if you

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,680
actually

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,799
look at reality it's actually quite a

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,239
large um

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,760
town that is really part of greater

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,480
london it's in greater london and the

00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,480
council

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,080
is actually quite a large council it's

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,599
unfortunately just become bankrupt but

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,560
anyway that's another story that doesn't

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,680
impinge on this

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,920
particular tale at all and it's got

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,040
quite a quite a large it department in

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,879
the council

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,319
and i'll talk a little bit more later

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,959
about how this project actually

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,599
developed but they do quite a lot of

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,040
their own

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,040
internal development and particularly

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,319
web development so the the story that

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,439
we're going to be talking about is

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,799
really you know how

00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:14,799
they've looked at that web development

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,120
to decide that they can uh try to share

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,440
code with some of the other councils

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,199
um yeah there's now about 10 10 councils

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,560
involved in this project

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,560
okay and that's actually one of the key

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,199
differences because um most

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,960
uh spanish at least the ones i know um

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,440
id departments in public sector are very

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,919
very

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,759
uh few people and they outsource and

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,560
they subcontract nearly all the i.t

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,479
development

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,320
um so this is basically for labor

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,240
reasons for finance budgeting

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,240
crediting going bust sound failure is

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,160
not quite going bust yet but

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,600
um it could be happening okay so let's

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,880
let's have a look at i'll explain

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,639
the projects i'm looking at and then

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,360
andy will explain his and we'll come

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,280
together again

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,639
um explaining a little bit uh what we

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,320
think um the issues are what the

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,800
challenges are what some good practices

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,520
are

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,360
okay so in our um in some video there's

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,440
really two projects totally different

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,680
um gd matrix is a really fairly old

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,039
project it started in 2011.

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,199
it's very mature it's gone through

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:10,240
various cycles it's been built

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,600
um for some philly

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:17,199
under several public contracts um it's

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:20,000
very complex it's a case management uh

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,199
information flow software for managing

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,880
uh you know public

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,320
files cases in in the public

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,160
administration so it's

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,440
one of the core elements of their

00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,880
infrastructure

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,720
um it has obviously you know

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,080
public-facing interface so people can

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,759
upload their own files

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,600
whatever with authenticity and all that

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,759
type of thing so it's quite complex

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:43,199
um it's uh as i said it was built

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:46,560
uh from 2011 onwards so

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,080
quite you know 10 years old now um and

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,160
i wouldn't i wouldn't care to say how

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,199
many lines of code what's important is

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,680
how it was built so

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,440
actually built under public bid by a

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,039
private company as i said and it's

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,360
actually been the same company

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,720
over the years um they've they've had

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,759
new bids they've had different people

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,319
try to come in

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,960
and work with the code and be the

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,400
supplier

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,560
but in the end the same companies

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,039
managed probably due to its

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,240
advantage in knowing the code uh and

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,479
costs savings

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,680
to stay there so that's been uh good in

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,400
terms of continuity

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,080
uh bad in terms of of spreading the news

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,560
and spreading the the knowledge about

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,199
this code okay so it's very centralized

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,120
um

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,319
it's managed by one project manager in

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,680
in the um and

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:31,759
in in the uh municipality

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,800
um and it was built as code for the for

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,600
the uh minister

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,560
for okay so it wasn't actually kind of

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,800
built

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,400
to be freed as as some projects as the

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,160
next project is about so it was

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,840
wasn't necessarily built in an open

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,520
source manner with open source

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,240
methodologies and modular

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,120
and and you know iterative in in more

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,479
agile way

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:54,000
so it's more monolithic um old style but

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,599
freeable that's one of the issues we had

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,599
to look at was do the ip

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,280
clearance and and to see who owns the

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,039
code and how

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,240
but because this has been managed quite

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,120
strictly in fact it was not too

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,039
difficult

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,400
brain5t is a totally different project

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,280
totally didn't stay just about a year

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,280
old

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,199
it's the brainchild of a single member

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,800
of the i.t department the

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,160
project manager who did it as a separate

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,479
independent project

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,440
working on ai which is about a year and

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,800
a half ago you know

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,840
so the fashion these days and look at ai

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,520
and how that can be

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,400
used as a framework for doing for

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,800
supporting certain municipal services

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,520
so it's fresh new it was built to be

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,440
opened because

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,280
this is the the project manager who is

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,919
leading sponsoring

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,880
the concept of doing open source at some

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,919
philo

00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:44,160
uh and so it's built uh on github

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,440
um actually closed github for the

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,759
beginning because he's a

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,879
a public sector official so he you know

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,720
doesn't he can't

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,000
open up the code until he's authorized

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,960
to do so

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,479
um but it was built to be open um which

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,400
changes enormously

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,560
uh how it's built from a technical point

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,960
of view uh the infrastructure where it's

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,720
built

00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,160
uh because basically open freeing it

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,080
would basically be putting a license on

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,919
and clicking github making an open

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,599
repository whereas the other one needs a

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,319
huge amount of grooming

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,759
okay turn the page and let's see what

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,560
happens so as i said this is

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:18,080
um totally two different stories of

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,080
where the how the code got to this

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,919
situation that we want to free it

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,759
okay and the mandate is actually a

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,759
really good mandate because both the

00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,680
political people in the council in favor

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,400
of this the technical people are in

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,160
favor

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,440
um even the legal department's in favor

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,919
which is which is always

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,880
very positive so everybody's behind this

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,919
um

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,719
and uh but we had to look at it from two

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,320
very different perspectives the one

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,000
interesting thing about gd matrix

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,519
is that it had already been shared with

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,080
other municipalities

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,040
under you know kind of public to public

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,240
agreements

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,880
uh private internal agreements i'd say

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,000
um

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,920
where you say we will share the code

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,959
with you uh and for free because that's

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,000
what the law says

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,800
we must do uh but there's no open source

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,720
community

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,959
feeling about it so there's no key pro

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,519
quo your contributions my contributions

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,279
centralized management single backlog

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,320
prioritization of issues nothing of that

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,000
sort it's just

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,440
we have this code if you want to use it

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,320
you can borrow it and here it is you can

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,920
use it

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,360
okay so that there wasn't there is a

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,240
beginning of a community there because

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,959
we have seven

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,080
or eight i think um cities which are

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,839
using this code

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,440
uh but just not in any collaborative

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,440
manner um

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,640
uh well specifically open source

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,320
collaborative manner

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,519
okay so that's something brave rit

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,080
hasn't been shared with anybody it's

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,200
just a

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,080
in-house seed of a project um and that

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,279
one i think

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,200
is going to be much much easier and

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,880
we're going to be get some traction um

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,600
quite quickly on that

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,240
so so the mission i was came in on is

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,720
one

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,680
ip clearance make sure that we have the

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,440
ip rights

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,880
to be able to free this you know old

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,279
code where it comes from

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,440
and this new code and who owns it that

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,200
was the easy bit in in legal terms

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,480
but the second half was and how do we

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,839
free it

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,560
i would say properly but but at least

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,240
in a manner that we can guarantee or get

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,600
the benefits of open source

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,600
and not just have to throw more money

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,680
more money more money at the code

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,040
from us as owners of code and just hope

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,519
that somewhere out there someone will

00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,800
use it and maybe give us something back

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,120
okay so it's concept of building

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,880
community um but a little bit top down

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,640
because the code's there it's been

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,640
seeded it's been put out there

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,160
we've got some collaborators but we have

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,200
we haven't really built any community

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,360
dynamics

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,600
okay so it's quite difficult to kick

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,680
start or cold start

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,640
community dynamics when we don't really

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,440
have those

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,399
um community dynamics yet okay andy do

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,519
you want to go

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,800
um next okay so so the issues are here

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,680
and this is why i'm stopping handing

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,079
over to issues

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,880
is is that the status of what we looked

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,800
at okay

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,079
so we had two different projects we need

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,200
to look at them both in a very different

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,040
manner

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,040
so there's no one-size-fits-all that's

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,440
right that's an important first learning

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,360
um well everybody agreed that we don't

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,079
need to set up a foundation and an

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,399
institute

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,640
a public body i mean not another public

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,079
body please

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,640
there are loads of umbrella

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,279
organizations like the the region

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,000
government there are

00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:14,480
inter-administrative

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,200
i.t support bodies which help as well so

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,959
there's

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,800
there's actually an entity set up here

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,480
in catalonia whose mission

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,000
is to provide i.t support and

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,480
centralized i.t

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,480
uh digital transformation for the small

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,920
municipalities who cannot afford it

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,240
okay so there's loads of if we need it

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,040
in the body that there it could be there

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,480
but in the end we said well we're doing

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,320
this ourselves at the moment so let's do

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,360
it ourselves and see how we can go there

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,279
so nobody okay no no no okay

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,200
on the ip front um once we've done the

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,440
clearance um it was important to say

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,720
keep it simple keep it clean let's not

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,640
have complications with special

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,639
agreements with special parties and

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,959
this is your code my code no let's

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,639
really try and adopt an open source

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,000
uh uh method here where they're like

00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,040
a part of what's called a social

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,480
contract is that if you're going to

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,440
contribute you contribute under this

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,399
license

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,920
um a uk you know you the other cities

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,760
retain ownership

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:10,160
and the right ip rights but you use the

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:13,360
like the the project license

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,000
okay and um i think the final point is

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,360
is

00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,040
goes together is the management and the

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,800
sustainability

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:22,480
is um although the public sector is

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,160
it may not seem to be very much an

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,079
economic entity because they've got

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,279
money public money in fact they are

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,160
they they are very very um close to

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,720
their money because they have very

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,800
little

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,160
amounts of money at least in spain we

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,000
have very little amounts of money

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,279
in the public sector and it has to be

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,120
very very carefully

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:43,760
uh managed that there is there's a value

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,399
for money type of deal in going open

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,320
source

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,000
is that we get more out of this than

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,120
we're going to have to put in

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,959
um so how can we set

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,959
up so that we've got this win-win for

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,880
everybody you know

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,079
the the the stanfield obviously had put

00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,839
the most in at the moment because they

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,320
had invested in the building

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,920
so for everybody else it was it was an

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,560
easy one you know we've got code thanks

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,040
very much

00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,560
you know open source code we can use it

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,560
the important thing is getting a dynamic

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,680
so that actually those people give back

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,079
and and and the costs are shared okay um

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,920
in in in in in the evolution and that

00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,600
was very important in in terms of

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,040
the political decision of case we go

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,079
open source it's not going to be a

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,920
burden for us

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,440
it's going to be a win and how do we set

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,519
up the structures for the win

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,600
okay so that that's that was basically

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,160
the the the

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,120
the challenge is is from these old

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,160
projects well the

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,399
i think the arm project is going to be

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,680
very easy sorry historically everything

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,680
got to stop because on the

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,680
20th of february last year and we had

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,279
covered in spain we had lockdown so

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,760
nothing really happened after that and

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:48,880
all the it departments got really busy

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,720
um setting up people from home okay so

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,920
these had a one year refreeze since the

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,079
last thing okay

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,519
so that's where we are um and over to

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,320
you andrew just to compare how

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,600
what happened in cordon yeah super um

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,519
okay so this is uh just some of the

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,639
councils that are involved um let's say

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,399
this we're up to about

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,959
10 councils in total but it's primarily

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,279
being driven by um croydon and brighton

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,399
um and then bracknell forest and oxford

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,240
are also involved and then there's other

00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,320
councils involved um further along

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,160
along the line um and also a couple of

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,800
agencies in their dxw and

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,959
agile collective um who are sort of both

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,279
helping on the technical side of things

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,320
so how did this start well there was a

00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,440
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,519
um thousand pound local government award

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,600
um which was available to councils that

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,920
wanted to try to do innovative things

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,199
in digital and this was applied for uh

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:39,279
towards the end

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:42,560
of 2019 um and then in 2020

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,000
um croydon and three other councils

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,760
won the award and they started this

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,360
project and the first thing to do is

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,440
really they wanted to work out

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,360
how to share code for their websites and

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,199
they're all using drupal so

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,120
um you know this seemed to be a sort of

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,639
pretty simple sort of lightweight proof

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,880
of concept to see how

00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:00,880
this might work so they went into a

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,079
discovery phase asking other councils

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,680
what they were doing

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,519
um and trying to find out the

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,959
differences between the councils what

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,120
particular characteristics

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,959
um they had what their approaches might

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,079
be um you know what their blockers are

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,560
and we'll talk about those

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,240
um a little bit later and then as a

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,360
result of that they decided to form

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,880
a coding club um and

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,399
it was really all about sharing code

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,839
what they didn't want to do is to set up

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,639
an organization that was going to

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,600
provide you know

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,320
local government website services um as

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,240
a service

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,920
um it was it was very much at the

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,240
developer end of things

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,720
trying to work out how to share code to

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,399
make everything operate more efficiently

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,920
and they basically as you know in

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,040
parallel with some of the criteria that

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,720
malcolm was talking about they really

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,000
wanted it to be as lightweight

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,199
um and simple as possible so first of

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,160
all they went into

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,639
a discovery phase um and this is example

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,920
of

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,680
remember the days when people used to

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,079
sit around tables and talk to each other

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,000
well

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,680
we managed that for about two weeks

00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,440
before we got locked down

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,600
uh but then because we were operating in

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,880
agile type fashion anyway most of these

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,720
people are developers so they're used to

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,160
operating in an agile fashion

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,440
um and actually from my personal

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,519
perspective it's the first time that

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,519
i've been embedded in a team that was

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,320
being managed in an agile fashion and i

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,160
it was a real

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,759
eye opener and the timing couldn't have

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,839
been better because when we went into

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,959
lockdown you know we transferred

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,800
a lot of that sort of activity using

00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,240
tools like slack for example

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,759
um into the way that we run our business

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,880
as well anyway that's that's that's

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,320
another story

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:32,720
um so um

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,360
and as a result of the the discovery

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,560
phase

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,959
um you know we went through

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,240
these these um that we we discovered

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,600
these these uh particular

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,000
characteristics i'm not going to go into

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,560
them

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,759
um in in detail uh but obviously you

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,440
know councils have a lot of things in

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,000
common they continuously want to improve

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,399
their

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,600
their websites and and um even though

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,120
councils can vary

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,639
very differently in terms of the size

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,160
and the sort of populations they serve

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,120
some of them maybe in the countryside

00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,440
some of them may be

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,959
um in urban areas uh there's still a lot

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,639
of things that they have to do

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,000
that that are in common so it seems like

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,199
a sort of a natural

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,640
fit for some sort of um some sort of

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,640
sharing

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,720
but part of the issue is that at

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,760
different levels within the council

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,199
um so different levels of management

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,199
management doesn't necessarily

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,880
quite get you know how code sharing

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,240
might operate they don't understand open

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,360
source they don't understand agile

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,600
methodology

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,199
um in the same way as you know all the

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,679
people that i was talking to and one of

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,960
the one of

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,120
the things that i found really

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,799
heartening was that i mean you know

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,120
these developers they really

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,840
understand agile they understand open

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,640
source

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,679
um they understand uh the licensing um

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,440
behind it

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,720
um and they realize that and we'll talk

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,320
about this a little bit later

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,480
um one of the challenges is really

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,360
trying to sell these ideas to management

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,360
further up

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,360
within the council so that they can they

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,640
can you know people at all levels can

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,720
can buy into the idea um but you know

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,559
fundamentally this was intended to be a

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,240
proof of concept and if it works the

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:01,919
idea and it has worked

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,160
and then the idea is to expand this into

00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,919
into different areas as well

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,360
so in common with what malcolm was

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,960
saying we decided there was no need for

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,520
a formal incorporated body of

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,080
of any sort we thought we'd agree on on

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,840
a very

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,679
lightweight documentation so we have a

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,000
memorandum of understanding which is

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,840
only four pages long

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,039
we appreciate that licensing models are

00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,480
complicated and we're not going to talk

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,080
about licensing now

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,400
in this particular case we just decided

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,000
to go for gpl because drupal is gpl and

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,919
everything you plug into jupiter

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,600
is probably going to be gpl as well so

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,280
you know don't think about it too hard

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,080
just go for gpl

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,440
and it needs to be and the concept needs

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,600
to be easy to sell

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,200
within the hierarchy of the council it

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:45,039
needs to be easy to sell

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,600
to the management um so

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,799
um i mean the the advantages which were

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,039
sort of obvious to us

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,080
and maybe not quite so so obvious to

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,760
management

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,440
um were things like you know we're not

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,160
reinventing the wheel um

00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,160
so there's so so a piece of code can be

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,559
reused everywhere that's really the

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,600
the fundamental point behind this but it

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,120
means that

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,280
once this code has been shared there's

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,000
less lock-in because you're not tied to

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,120
one particular proprietary provider of a

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,880
platform

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,559
um but we figured out that it's still

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,919
possible for a commercial ecosystem to

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,240
develop i mean you have councils like

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:21,440
croydon who have the in-house capability

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,840
uh to be able to develop their own code

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,280
um but then you you have other councils

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,840
and these are some of the other councils

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,520
sort of

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,280
that are joining now you know who are

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,400
much smaller who maybe only have

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,880
you know a couple of people in their

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,240
tech department um and who aren't able

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,039
to do that so they're really going to

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,679
want to

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,799
um outsource but not necessarily to an

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,720
organization

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,240
that is just providing a one-stop

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,000
service they want to take advantage of

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,720
the cost savings etc that you get here

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,320
as well so

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,320
we believe that this sort of ecosystem

00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,520
will develop in the future

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,039
and certainly the developers like

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,880
working in open source software they're

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,480
like agile methodologies

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,240
um they like the community et cetera et

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,120
cetera so that was a positive for us as

00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,360
well

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,960
um we've got some figures on cost saving

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,760
which if we've got time i'll share with

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,360
you but you know

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,600
there's a perception in cost saving the

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,679
reason as an exclamation mark is that

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,280
a lot of people are trying to say um

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:11,520
open source isn't about cost saving it's

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,960
more about other advantages as well but

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,880
for councils where you're talking about

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,679
public money you know cost saving

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,200
is important and speed of deployment you

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,000
know you can you can roll that out

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,440
quickly as well

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,520
uh malcolm i don't know whether you know

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,640
that your your um your the

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,400
discussions that you had with your

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,400
projects have had a sort of similar list

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,000
yeah uh next sorry great so

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,520
you asked something uh yeah sure and i

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,280
was just wondering whether whether those

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,799
um sort of perceived advantages were

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,320
similar to the disadvantages that you

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,679
received as well

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,679
very much so except that don't forget

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,960
that in our in our case um

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,559
we had very few developers because the

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,760
developers are all outsourced so the

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:50,960
people who are managing this actually

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,400
were the project managers

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,799
who are the you know and systems of the

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,600
systems admin um who are in the in the

00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,760
um

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,640
uh administration and and then the the

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,080
political levels

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,480
and the legal department so it was a

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,039
very much more top-down approach in that

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,960
sense

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,480
and the actual people to building it the

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,159
the developers

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,440
were not so keen because they were

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,960
coming from a private company and they

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,600
had this specific leverage they had for

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,400
their code

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,080
but the code was owned by the by the um

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,880
public administration so they had no say

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,159
in that in

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,559
that matter um but but but yes the the

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,080
the

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,559
those arguments the less lock in the

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,480
cost savings uh were all seen as as

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,880
big arguments in favor of of freeing

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,440
this and building the community yes

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,559
yeah great um and um you know and we

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,400
were concerned there were some

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,240
possible problems as as well and i'm not

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,000
going to go into these in depth but

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,919
um you know there is a perception that

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,400
um the open source software

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,080
um isn't necessarily as turnkey ready as

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,520
proprietary software is

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,600
and also because you're not necessarily

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,200
dealing with a commercial organization

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,559
um it means that you you know the legal

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,000
department gets a bit uncomfortable

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,520
about it so possible blockers are what

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,320
the legal department's going to say

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,320
what management is going to say so he's

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,640
trying to present everything in a way

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,320
um that basically said this is going to

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,080
be as low friction as possible

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,600
um it's just a proof of concept at the

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,919
moment if it doesn't work it's not going

00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,919
to be

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,280
a big you will just learn something but

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,480
it's not we've not committed ourselves

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,720
to something huge

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,080
and i think that was something that made

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,039
it a lot easier

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,200
um for for organizations to to other

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:22,320
councils to get involved as well

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,600
yeah yeah i i i hear the pain in fact in

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,440
one of these when it's the perception

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,200
that you have to do more yourself

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:30,559
um because um obviously the the the

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,559
council that was just running its own

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,080
software passes from running its own

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,960
software and managing an open source

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,039
community

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,799
um yeah because obviously the the

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,799
council was going to be the leader

00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,559
at least for the first stage of the

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,919
community committing resources to

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:47,120
building the community

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:49,120
and and uh they said well we've hardly

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,280
got the bandwidth today to run our

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,720
systems how we're going to find the time

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,080
and the money and the staff

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,039
and the skills because obviously running

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,000
a community is very different from

00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,919
running an open source

00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,200
running a project you know a public

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,039
public sector project

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,640
so so that was probably one of the

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,440
biggest tasks is saying how can we do

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,840
this

00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:09,600
so that um we we get time

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,400
uh freed up so that we can actually

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,159
build community

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,679
run some events do some mailings do

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,559
everything else that happens in the

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,440
community

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,760
yeah okay okay so looking governance

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,640
here

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,159
um the the so this is this is as i say

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,200
work in progress because things

00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,799
will put a little bit on hold um similar

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,960
a little bit to the mou that

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,960
uh member of understanding yeah that

00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,480
that uh andy mentioned

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,559
um what what the spanish

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,520
public system works on the basis of

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,120
agreements and

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,559
and formal documents and this is

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,559
something that uh

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:43,679
if if you want to dedicate staff

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,440
resources money

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,880
to a project there has to be some form

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,720
of cover

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,640
legal contractual administrative cover

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,679
for this a project to set up for this

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,880
okay if you want to collaborate although

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,080
the law actually says you don't have

00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,840
need to have an agreement

00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,520
the way they've collaborated for the

00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,159
last 150 years is

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,039
through agreements so um just just

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,840
getting this through the legal

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,039
department was

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,960
easier if we said you know let's do an

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,520
umbrella agreement very much in line

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,760
with

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,720
andy's mou but much more detailed

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,400
because it's

00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,919
public sector you've got three or four

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,520
lawyers looking at it and they all

00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,080
want to add in their own little bit of

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,840
redlining okay but the the the content

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,200
of this which is a draft it's on the

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,440
table being discussed

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,039
is is what andy's probably gonna mention

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,880
actually in his um

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,880
mou is question of who we are what we're

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,240
doing um how to join this how to join

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,200
the boat how to come and leave

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,640
what commitments can be made um and and

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,559
we can talk a little bit more about that

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,559
if there's a binding commitment to say

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,679
well if you're joining look put up 5 000

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,600
you know euros

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,799
um and that goes into a pool and that

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,200
money will be used for

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:47,600
the backlog and the top priorities in

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,120
the next iteration of the project

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,320
um at the moment it's easier to sign an

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,919
administrative agreement if there's no

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,200
money involved so the moment there's

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,480
nothing there's no provision

00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,840
for economics but there is provision

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,960
which more important for governance to

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,080
see how that works

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:07,039
okay so setting up some committees uh

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,200
in terms of who who's the project owner

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:11,520
uh user committee technical committee

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,039
um it it's heavyweight uh if anybody

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,960
looking at it you seem to be

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,080
jump starting a tiny project to

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,000
something like apache

00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,200
apache castle but that's the way the

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,640
public administration works here and

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,320
they understand committees

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,840
they can actually work with committees

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,039
they have minutes things happen

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,039
once you've got the minutes and the

00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:29,440
agenda and everything

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,320
i don't think the projects we're working

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,559
in would work on

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,679
on how andy's this kind of like informal

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,679
code sharing

00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,200
is not in the culture of the

00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:37,440
administration it's in the culture of

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,360
the

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,200
of the developers who are actually doing

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,279
it but it's not in the culture of the

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,880
the people who are pushing a little bit

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:46,559
more top down this project

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,559
okay and then the other thing is setting

00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:49,039
up the community tools so github offers

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,880
a lot

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,240
but there's more than that so so

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,200
identifying

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,960
what was the community dynamics and how

00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,120
to get people on board for that

00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,000
um that was important and brain40 is

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,080
very much uh

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,840
very very simple mapping a private

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,919
sector project just put on github

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,360
let's get some talks let's have some jam

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,840
sessions hack fest

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,039
a meet up or whatever um there's no

00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,200
urgent priority

00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,240
uh to get that working well there is now

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,520
but in terms of

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,640
technology but um so the more important

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,080
i think more interesting is

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,679
is the other one is the gd matrix and

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,559
how that was looked at

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,320
how does that compare with you andy um

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:29,520
yeah i think um it's really in

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,200
in terms of the ability for these

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,279
organizations to be able to operate on

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,240
an informal basis um and as you said we

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,320
had some memorandum

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,919
of understanding this is only four pages

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,000
long and there's a link to it if you

00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,000
want to have a look at it later

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,520
um but um there's a list here of the

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,440
sort of the headings that that we

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,279
covered uh the most important

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,640
um words in the whole thing are at the

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,360
bottom in red this agreement is

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,360
non-binary

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,200
so that basically gave people an excuse

00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,480
not to show this thing to their legal

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,799
departments

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,799
which so there's a sort of culture of

00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,559
sort of you know ask for forgiveness

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,440
rather than permission just go ahead and

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,960
do something

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,480
and then and then if you if somebody

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,960
tells you off then you say i'm sorry i

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,279
really

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,760
shouldn't have done that uh so this was

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:11,279
the idea was that uh

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,880
this this really was the sort of most

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:16,159
most lightweight um

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:18,720
possible uh way of of arranging

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,279
this relationship um and so the the

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,640
final

00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,720
um i'm not going to go through these

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,919
categories the last one is finance i

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,760
mean there's nothing in there about

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,480
finance nobody has to make any financial

00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,919
commitment

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,200
and as soon as you've got a situation

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,960
where you don't have to have any budget

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,320
sign off then suddenly it becomes a lot

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,799
more straightforward

00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,520
um so it was sort of semi-done under the

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,520
radar

00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,279
um and the more successful the project

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,720
became the more that people admitted

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:41,600
that they were actually being involved

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,520
in it

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,120
so it was based on a set of values this

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,559
is actually part of the mou but it's

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,080
also based on something called the local

00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:51,279
digital declaration

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,360
which is um something that has been uh

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,960
that a lot of um local authorities and

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:56,000
and um other government entities have

00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,559
signed up to

00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,480
um it it's it's very much a sort of open

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,080
source methodology list of list of the

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,279
sort of values that that you would

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,559
um apply um and some

00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,760
you know people said very nice things

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:13,039
about the memorandum of understanding

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:15,279
um so where are we with this now um well

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,520
it was deployed in december

00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,320
we reckon that all of the councils

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,760
involved

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,960
on the average of five microsites are

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,000
going to save something like you know

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,200
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,320
000 pounds um for the development costs

00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,720
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,080
000 euros so across england you know we

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,679
could save millions of pounds

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,919
really by using using this sort of

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,320
structure um

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:38,320
and uh and this is an example of the

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,600
just one of the websites that's using it

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,960
at the moment so the sort of thing that

00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,520
you need to do if you interact with your

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,000
council

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,720
you need to pay for things um you you

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,120
know like

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,000
uh you might have to pay your taxes um

00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,200
you might have to find

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,799
things like where you can find a

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,159
recycling bank or where you can find a

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,600
library or something

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,679
uh you might have to apply for various

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,279
permits and things and then if there are

00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,080
problems like potholes in the road you

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:01,919
need

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,520
a mechanism for um for reporting them

00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,320
um so i'm very conscious that we're

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,000
running very very short of time here

00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,159
um so malcolm i don't know if there's

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,760
anything you want to talk about yeah

00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,799
one final point five final points i

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,520
think we've only got we've only got a

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,760
couple of minutes

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,960
um i think i think there's been there's

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,159
a major difference between what you've

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,480
you've talked about and what i've talked

00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,240
about

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,320
in terms of you're very much bottom up

00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,640
build the team uh and and they just say

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,039
us

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,640
ask for forgiveness um mine's top down

00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,720
because it's been driven from the top

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,799
uh and in fact i haven't you know kind

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,279
of it's a pity that we couldn't also do

00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,720
both

00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,880
and get the developers together and have

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,240
some you know pizza parties and

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,840
and get people interested through the

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,960
bottom i think that would definitely the

00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,000
root next time

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:45,679
um i think the pros and cons of both but

00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,559
both methods um and and as is from our

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,200
side i think

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,320
the the the formal justification of of

00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,159
getting

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,080
freeing this is is is important that's

00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:57,120
why i think we formalized it a bit more

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:59,520
than what you're saying um but again

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,720
it's embedded in our culture here and

00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,840
that's that'll be very different in

00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,960
france german italy

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,240
whatever i imagine so and and regionally

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,840
so and the other thing is we do have the

00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,640
benefit of barcelona i mean barcelona is

00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,600
really a driving

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,080
force for open source in in the area and

00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,480
and and

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,919
having a big sister doing all that it's

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,799
really it's fantastic because it's a me

00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,159
too type thing well

00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:21,760
the positive me too um and things

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,679
anyway that's i think the final comment

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:25,039
is is and and if there is a leader that

00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,640
let's follow the way and

00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,159
and take advantage of those you know

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,600
piggybacking a little on that

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,240
yeah exactly um excellent and there's

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,919
some links

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,360
um and we also have a nice mission patch

00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,000
as well this is for the beta plan

00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,240
so okay i'll be recommending i'll be

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,760
recommending your drupal for for uh for

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,360
you as well we can remember your

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,159
community you have to have a catalan

00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,440
version

00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:50,320
yeah definitely right

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,440
fantastic i think we have time for i

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,159
don't know

00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:55,919
how we get questions yeah hi there um

thank you for that that was uh wonderful

00:30:55,919 --> 00:31:00,320
some really interesting points up there

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,960
um so we have had a lot of people in the

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,200
chat

00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,000
um talking it seems like you've sparked

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,279
some good discussion

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,320
there and um i have a question um

understandings public

00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,000
