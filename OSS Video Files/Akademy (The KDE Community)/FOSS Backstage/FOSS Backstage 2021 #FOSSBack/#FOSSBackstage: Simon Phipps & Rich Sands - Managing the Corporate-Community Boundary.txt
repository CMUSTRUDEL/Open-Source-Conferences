Title: #FOSSBackstage: Simon Phipps & Rich Sands - Managing the Corporate-Community Boundary
Publication date: 2021-02-25
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	So you work for a corporation but are part of a community. Doing something controversial? Have lots of internal stakeholders with conflicting needs? Changing course in a way that makes people suspicious or concerned? Write an FAQ! No, really!

Do it not just for the FAQ itself, but for the process of aligning everyone behind a single, open strategy. If you can answer the hard questions publicly, honestly, and confidently, you’ll foster trust and build good will even when your audience does not hear the exact answers they want. What’s more, the feedback will give you the input you need to correct any errors you have in fact made.

In this talk, we’ll look at how to use an FAQ as tool and an excuse to:

- Organize the effort.
- Force decision makers and leaders to decide on goals, craft a coherent strategy, and understand and accept the tradeoffs.

 - Internally sell transparency and scrupulous honesty as essential to success.

 - Help the legal team be a partner, instead of just saying “no”.

 - Simplify and accelerate communications and make the Marketing Department an ally.


Learning from history

I’ll be using a bit of FLOSS history to illustrate these points – Sun’s Open Source Java Initiative.

Java wasn’t always Free Software. By 2005, Sun was making a lot of money with its staunchly proprietary Java platform. Richard Stallman called it a seductive “trap”. Under pressure from FLOSS community leaders to open source Java and turn it into a compelling example of the new model, Sun listened.

Those of us on the Java team were just as surprised as the rest of the software world by the announcement. Immediately, the questions started pouring in: Which license? How to encourage and manage contributions? What happens to the brand, and to Java’s “Write Once, Run Anywhere” compatibility promise? How does Sun continue to make money with Java, when the code is out there for anyone to use without paying a fee?

Sun didn’t know the answers. And these questions were in the minds of Sun’s customers, competitors, and knowledgeable FLOSS leaders. We needed a way to:



 - Answer the hard questions consistently and in one place so everyone would know.

 - Get the whole company on board, including management, lawyers, salespeople, engineers, and marketing personnel.

 - Communicate the answers successfully to diverse internal and external audiences.
 - Convince skeptics on both sides that this initiative would succeed in future-proofing Java’s business while keeping the platform relevant and exciting.



Thus was born the “Open Source Java FAQ”, which was inspired by an earlier FAQ done for the Debian community, and grew to 200 questions. It would prove to be a key tool in solving these problems.

	00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,960
uh welcome everybody

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:12,799
um so this talk is um

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,120
uh by way of experience sharing um

00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,039
uh rich and i used to work at some

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,880
microsystems

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,640
which is getting to the point now where

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,920
some of the younger viewers

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,439
may not even know it ever existed um

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:30,160
but sun was a dynamic and

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,880
controversial corporation um that

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,880
expired

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:38,239
in 2010 when oracle bought it

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:41,520
and while rich and i

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,920
worked for some microsystems we were

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,480
both

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,079
involved in making the java platform

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,120
open source

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,600
and that was a controversial thing

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,559
at the time and we're going to explain a

00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,760
little bit about why it was

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:55,840
controversial

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,280
and we're going to explain a little bit

00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,760
about what we did

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,520
to try and make java go open source

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,640
smoothly

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:07,520
in that process my role was

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,520
as the the chief open source officer at

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,000
sun i was the head of open source

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,119
i was running one of the industry's

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,520
first open source

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,880
program offices and the task that we're

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,200
going to be talking about

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,799
is very much an open source program

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,119
office task

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,880
uh and the tool that we're going to be

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,000
talking about is one that i have not

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,479
noticed

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,840
very many modern ospos actually thinking

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,400
about or using

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,439
so i'd very much encourage you to

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,320
consider

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,159
uh using this particular approach if

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,200
you're working in an open source program

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,960
office

00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:46,320
uh ricky's role at the time was to be

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,439
the um the the marketing guru for the

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,479
java team

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,079
and uh this uh the

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,159
technique that we're using was very much

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,920
his brainchild that he pioneered

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,280
perfected and uh used to to great effect

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,439
and so we're gonna we're gonna talk you

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,840
a little bit through that and uh

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,079
on the slides you see that there's um

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,280
two avatars there's a little rich and a

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,080
little simon

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,959
and that will give you some hint who is

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,480
uh

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,520
going to take the lead on each of those

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,160
slides if you come back to this talk

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,520
later and you want to ask questions you

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,560
can use those avatars

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,200
as your your guide to know which of us

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,280
to email to ask the question to

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,800
um so uh rich is gonna take it from here

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,599
it turns out that i'd never realized

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,560
this rich is

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,840
um a a competitor with randall monroe of

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,879
xkcd because he

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,080
he drew these so over to you rick

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,519
well thanks simon um so so why does why

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,560
is it so difficult for

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,959
companies to uh communicate with

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,760
uh communities well it's it really comes

00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,879
very

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,280
unnaturally to companies because

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,959
marketing departments are used to

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,080
adjusting the message for different

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,319
audiences

00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,360
that doesn't really work very well for

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,840
uh for

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,720
developer audiences so we're gonna talk

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,480
about

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,560
uh what happens when you've got some

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,599
explaining to do and we we had some

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,480
explaining to do

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,920
and we used the really uh boring

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,280
old-school

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:19,200
technique uh of the faq to solve that

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,840
problem uh next slide

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,519
so companies really don't always get it

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,319
a lot of companies uh

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,360
nowadays get it much better than uh 15

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,080
years ago

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,799
when we were at sun but a lot of

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,799
companies

00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,560
just don't really understand the open

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,680
source uh ethos

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,560
how the way how communities work uh and

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,080
um even companies that do understand it

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,120
have a tough time sometimes

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,480
matching their uh expectations and

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,720
corporate interests

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,080
with uh the community's interests when

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,480
they don't whine

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,480
next

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,840
so um how many of you have run into this

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,879
problem you

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,480
you roll out some terrific uh

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,120
program that you think everyone's going

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:08,319
to love and out come the pitchforks

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,560
and the torches uh while this is a

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,120
problem that that many of us have run

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,680
into

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,120
uh and uh you know simon why don't you

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,400
tell talk a little about

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,600
um what uh some of our experiences were

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,160
at sun with the

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,199
the four the pitchforks and the uh the

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,680
torches

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,440
okay so uh in many ways some

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,000
microsystems was one of the first

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,000
companies

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,680
to use open source as a strategic uh

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,639
approach the founding of the company

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,280
used bsd

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,800
unix and used it as the operating system

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,320
on workstations

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,520
and um the one of the founders of the

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,600
open source movement

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,199
uh was one of the founders of some micro

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,800
systems that's bill joy

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,280
and he was doing that around about the

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,160
same time that uh richard stallman was

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,360
working on the east coast so uh sun's

00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,960
history is very much

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,800
intertwined with the history of the free

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,600
and open source software movement

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,720
and um one of the problems with being a

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,680
pioneer

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,400
is that although you do things that are

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,080
that are

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,639
very effective and successful as a

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,120
pioneer when you succeed

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,560
a town gets built in the place where you

00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,320
used to be the pioneer

00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,600
and you don't fit in too well as one of

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,880
the towns people

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,840
and that was what happened with some

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,880
microsystems some

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,000
uh watched the uh open source movement

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,080
emerge

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,240
uh it always had a tense relationship

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,000
with the east wing of the free and open

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,199
source software movement

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,560
and um by the time we got to

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:43,840
the end of the 1990s um

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:47,360
sun was uh it fairly routinely

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,680
in conflict with the the the

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,600
free software movement led by richard

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,000
stillman

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:59,680
java was released in

00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,360
1995 sun tried very hard to do it in a

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,160
way that was

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,560
very open and fitted with its ethos and

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,120
the licensing around java in 1995 was

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,840
quite

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,680
revolutionary it gave anybody the

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,720
freedom to do anything they wanted to

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,240
with the software

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,000
as long as they weren't going to make

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,560
money with it um

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
they i don't that sounds familiar today

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,639
so the the licensing

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,600
that java had was this pioneering

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,919
completely

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,600
uh do what you want with this code

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,880
license and i know that was the case

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,000
because i worked at ibm

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,960
in 1995 and i started the java lab at

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,080
ibm

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,319
using exactly those freedoms and the

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,360
the whole fact that ibm came on board

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,160
and popularized

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,560
java in the enterprise was all down to

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,199
sun's use of open licensing

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,880
now sun assumed that everybody saw the

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,639
worthiness and goodness of this

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,800
but it turned out that that wasn't the

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,319
case that lots of people were very upset

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,840
about the strong field of use

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,800
protections that were in the java

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,319
licensing

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,479
arrangement they were there for an

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,720
excellent reason as was shown when

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,599
microsoft tried to do a hostile fork of

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,520
java at the end of the 1990s

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,360
and the licensing proved that it worked

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,639
well when microsoft had to pay something

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,759
like a billion dollars

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:17,280
as damages for uh their uh

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:20,400
attempt to embrace extend and extinguish

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,560
java in the late 90s so

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,440
when we got to the turn of the century a

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,520
lot of people

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,520
had by that point um missed the openness

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,560
and the loveliness of sun

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,319
and uh really were um out with the

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,520
pitchforks and the scythes

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,840
uh trying to deal with us uh sun one

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,680
one of the sun's great flaws is it it

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,800
failed to notice

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:48,319
the growing power of linux and of

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,280
the free software movement and uh it

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,560
it failed to fight that by making

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,319
solaris

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,000
open source free software early in its

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,360
life cycle and

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,319
uh some said many bad things about

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,280
um uh linux unfortunately and in fact

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,319
its founder

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,800
uh scott mcneely was known to do exactly

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,160
that

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:14,639
off the cuff during interviews and so um

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:18,639
by the time we got to uh the early 2000s

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,360
um we had been fairly soundly denounced

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,800
by

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,479
grok law the discussion forum and we

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,080
had also had the delight of having

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,759
richard stallman

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:33,120
write this uh article where he declared

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:37,440
that java was not

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,320
just a trap by its licensing taking away

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,599
your freedoms

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:44,240
but also it created a whole class

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,600
of evil that would forever be called the

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,200
java trap

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,680
and so uh well in 2004 the java team was

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,440
um by then it had already been

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,000
discussing making java open source for

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,160
about three

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,600
years and it was an unwelcome

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,640
development shall we say

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:04,080
that richard decided in 2004

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,080
to write this article and so one of my

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,120
jobs as chief open source officer

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,920
was to go and try and uh

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,680
solve these problems and so uh i spent

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,160
quite a lot of time

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,959
talking with the uh with pamela jones

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,120
who

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,120
ran grock law talking with the people in

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,320
the free java community to understand

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,959
their problems

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,959
and we we fairly quickly came to the

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,959
conclusion that although

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,279
internally we knew we were heading in

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,519
the direction of open source for java

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,560
no one outside was ever going to believe

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,880
us

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,959
they had lots of questions and they had

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,000
internally in their minds answered those

00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:45,360
questions in the worst possible way and

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,399
consequently we could come out uh

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,519
tomorrow back in 2004 and say that java

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,800
was open source

00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:55,680
and people would never trust us and so

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,200
um as part of the opening process we

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,399
learned about meeting people

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,320
talking with the community engaging the

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,079
leaders of the community

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,680
that we were working with we also

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,320
learned about not

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,399
um trying to compete with the community

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,720
and create a competing community

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,760
and so when we did our initial openings

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,560
of java

00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,240
um that was done by putting java under a

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,880
free-to-use license

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,560
a non-free but free to use license and

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,680
putting it into debian's non-free

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,720
repository

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:30,480
and we did that in uh in 2004

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,399
and we implanted a member of our staff

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,279
in the debian community tom marble

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,760
who is still there uh he he he went

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,680
native

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:42,160
uh fairly readily and did a fine job

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,200
working on java in the the debian

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,000
community

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,279
and also one of the things we did while

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,920
we were there was we

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,880
we wrote an faq explaining this

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,640
complicated

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,000
license that we used for java in the

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,959
world of debian

00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,399
and and that's why when we came to

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:02,720
actually open source java in 2005

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,760
rich decided that this was exactly the

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,839
tool to use

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,880
to solve all the presenting problems

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:13,040
that we had in open sourcing java

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:16,480
rich back to you thanks simon so

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,480
so uh next slide so

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,519
so we're gonna do this in the form of an

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,120
faq so

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:25,920
question why write an faq well

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,120
the number one reason to write an faq

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,040
like this i mean

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,160
you might have a community that has a

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,959
very simple

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,480
licensing there's no controversy

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,880
developers love you

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,120
they're using it they're adopting it you

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,959
probably don't need this kind of faq

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,560
but if you've got any sort of

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,600
controversy or things that

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,720
aren't aren't completely the way that

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,720
the community

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,760
would want to see it this can really

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,839
help you out

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,120
but the number one reason why you want

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,279
to write an faq

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,880
is to learn the answers to these

00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,240
questions yourself

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:03,600
so writing an faq that really

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,680
peels back the onion and goes deep on

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,880
the strategy and what you're trying to

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,160
accomplish

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,360
forces you the company and your

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,079
executives

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,440
and across the whole company all of the

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:19,200
different departments and

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:21,040
uh stakeholders to test and refine this

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,480
strategy and really figure out what it

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,200
is you're going to do

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,639
get everyone on the same page so that

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,480
there's no disagreement

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:32,800
and no uh no cross purposes and then

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,920
teach all of the people who have to talk

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,040
about this

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:40,560
what are the messages and um

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:43,680
how to explain this strategy

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,720
to the community and what this allows

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,680
you to then do

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,360
is establish trust because you're being

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,360
completely transparent

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,480
you're putting everything out there on

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,880
the table so that

00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,760
everyone can figure it out if you can

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,760
answer

00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,839
the difficult questions about your

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,480
strategy intelligently

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,320
then you've got a coherent strategy if

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,079
you can't answer those questions you

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,959
probably need to go back to the drawing

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:11,279
board

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:13,600
next slide so who's the audience

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,399
well in a nutshell the audience is

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,880
developers

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,519
marketing people are comfortable with

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,959
having

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:23,839
this message for sale for the uh

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,200
customers this message for the engineers

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,519
different messages for different

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,320
audiences but that really doesn't work

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:32,240
for developer initiatives and it turns

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:36,079
out that developers are actually

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,839
the most difficult audience to please

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,240
and so that makes them the most

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:43,120
important audience because if you can

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,320
make your developer uh audience the

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,959
people you're trying

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,760
to get to adopt your platform if you can

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,320
get them

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,800
to be satisfied pretty much everyone

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,360
else is going to come along for the ride

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,920
and that's because everyone knows that

00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,040
in an

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,680
adoption-led strategy the developers

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,440
really

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,040
hold all the cards they're the ones that

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,120
are going to make the decision

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,120
are we going to adopt this technology or

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,440
are we going to go use something else

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,279
so if you're a customer for technology

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,440
you're going to ask your engineers

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,120
how is this thing is it good is it bad

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,880
what what should we do

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,720
if if you're uh if you're

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,560
whoever if you're the press if you're

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,160
the analyst you're going to ask

00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,920
independent developers

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,440
what do you guys think of this community

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,160
what do you guys think of

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,160
of how this company is engaging so

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,360
really the developers are the are the

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,079
key audience

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,079
next slide

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,680
what's most important to developers well

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,639
in a nutshell

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,240
transparency developers want to know

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,720
everything there is to know

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,360
about your strategy the truth the whole

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,000
tooth

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,959
and nothing but the truth it's difficult

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,760
to do this

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:56,639
but that's why this is such a powerful

00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,399
technique

00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,839
so they want to know the motivations

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,199
what are your goals what are your

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,079
objectives what are you trying to

00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,160
accomplish

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,720
by doing what you're doing so in sun's

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:10,240
example uh you know why open source

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:13,040
java what are you trying to do uh

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,600
you know whether the developer community

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,720
likes

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,040
your answers or not it's very very

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,839
important to put it all out there on the

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,720
table to explain what it is you're doing

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,079
because the one thing that developers

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:31,279
won't forgive

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:31,279
is uh lies

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,120
spin all the things that marketing

00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,839
people often will

00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,360
will do to try to adjust how people

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,839
perceive a company

00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,880
developers really just push back at that

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,440
and say forget it

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,360
we're just we're just not into that so

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,519
if developers see that you're on their

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,639
side that you're really trying to put it

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,040
all out there

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,320
they can sometimes cut you some slack

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,480
even if they don't like

00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:00,639
your strategy completely next slide

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,959
okay so here's a few more questions do i

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,680
have to answer the hard questions too

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:08,399
absolutely you must answer in fact

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:11,600
that's the most important thing because

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,680
adoption-led strategies are not new

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,959
developers know where the traps are

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,600
developers know

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:20,079
where the problems can crop up and they

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,680
expect you to answer those questions

00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,079
if you don't answer the questions it's

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,880
like a red flag they're trying to hide

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,639
something

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,160
if you do answer the questions and you

00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,560
answer them intelligently

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,079
and with depth then developers know that

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,480
you know even if they don't agree with

00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,120
you

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,000
that you you know what you're doing well

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,839
what if we don't know

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,120
the answers well how about that

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,240
transparency thing

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,800
just say we don't know that works very

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,800
well

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,040
and especially if you then come back and

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,279
and uh answer the questions later

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,720
when you do know well what if they don't

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:54,000
like the answers

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,320
well the truth is what's going to earn

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,519
you

00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:00,079
the respect and trust to allow you

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,880
to have a strategy that may not

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,360
completely

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,079
solve all of the uh the problems that

00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,559
the community

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,480
is looking to solve you may have some

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,919
goals and objectives that the community

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,199
just isn't interested in

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:16,839
or doesn't even agree with but if your

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:20,160
method for doing this uh this uh

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:23,520
uh initiative matches up

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,880
with their uh uh needs and objectives

00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,039
sometimes you can

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,240
uh live together in the same community

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,280
go ahead simon

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,799
uh one thing to to emphasize here

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,640
is uh well actually there's two things

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,080
to emphasize first of all the faq

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,640
isn't a static document it's not

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,799
something you write once and forget

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,919
it's a document that you constantly

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,280
update as you learn

00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,720
more and that where it's the way you

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,120
communicate

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,600
uh to the whole community but also to

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,880
your whole internal team

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,520
second thing to point out is that the

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,440
faq is not necessarily about

00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,039
you the great source of wisdom and

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,760
knowledge telling the poor

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,039
uneducated and unwashed outsiders what

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,039
the truth is

00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:07,039
this process is very much about you

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:09,440
discovering how others see you

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:11,760
it's very much about you discovering

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,039
what the flaws of your strategy are once

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,799
you've embarked on it

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,440
it's about you discovering the truth

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,240
yourself not just you telling truth to

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,840
others

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:23,360
and as a consequence the faq

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,080
used in the way that we're describing

00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,320
here can prove to be very challenging it

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,080
can lead you into places in discussion

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,360
with your internal staff where you have

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,559
big arguments

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,919
as you discover that that you're doing

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,039
things wrong and you've got to change

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,720
things because that

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:41,200
question that you're answering

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,679
demonstrates that no you can't

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,600
um you know we can't use the gpl in that

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,440
way with that licensing exception

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,600
because it will disrupt our business

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,200
model and you only discover that in the

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,320
discussion that arises from

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:56,320
talking through the faq it

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,640
it's very much a learning journey that

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,320
you're on as you do an faq

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,240
rick yeah and one of one of the things

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,000
that can happen is you actually

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,520
uh go through the process and you

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,799
discover that

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,520
um that developers just aren't going to

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,000
adopt your

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,919
your technology if you follow the

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,919
strategy that you have in mind

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,960
so then you have a choice change the

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,440
strategy

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:23,120
or don't change the strategy and don't

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:26,799
use an adoption-led developer-led

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,960
a model for for uh for success

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,320
so you've got choices but at least you

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,720
won't be surprised

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,200
and the community won't be surprised

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,600
next slide

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,240
so let's look at an example so this is

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:43,840
from the open source java faq

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:47,039
and so uh the question is why didn't you

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,039
choose a license like bsd or apache

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,240
well guess what that's actually a really

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:53,039
hard question

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,400
and the reason why it's hard uh is is

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,240
kind of involved but

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,600
there were at the time there were

00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,960
actually there were two

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,679
there were actually three different

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,320
editions of java micro edition

00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,960
standard edition and enterprise edition

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,440
and

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,080
the micro edition is what ran on phones

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,200
and uh

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,400
and uh small devices and the standard

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,520
edition is what

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,120
underlie the uh server stuff as well as

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:20,799
the desktop stuff

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,559
and so um uh we actually did two

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,360
different licenses we did the

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:27,039
straight gpl for the micro edition and

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,360
we did the gpl with

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:31,039
the class pap exception which is kind of

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,360
like lgpl

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,159
for standard edition well why did we do

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,280
that

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:40,000
well we wanted to drive more adoption

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,799
of java standard edition especially

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,919
within

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:46,320
linux distributions and so how did we

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,799
do that we picked the license that

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,080
matched up with linux's license

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:56,320
and um we uh we offered that

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:59,760
uh out to uh to uh linux distributions

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:02,559
uh this um a lot

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,919
but with with the straight gpl for the

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,159
micro edition

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,200
it minimized the likelihood that we were

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,679
going to have

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,440
incompatible forks so the the value

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,640
proposition for java

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:18,000
right once run anywhere uh really

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,600
relied on api level compatibility across

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,320
all the different implementations of

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,880
java

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,679
and we were really trying to stop uh

00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,880
things from

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,559
uh from forking we wanted to get a lot

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,000
of different uh

00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:35,120
uh elements of the open source world uh

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,000
uh engaged and involved and contributing

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,559
and we want but you know the the final

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,720
the

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,720
thing that was probably most important

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,240
to sons executives

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:49,520
was to protect and uh enhance the

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,559
uh binary licensing uh business

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,000
so some made a ton of money on java

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,080
and they made it primarily through

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,200
binary licensing so

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:02,400
we had this this very difficult

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,600
uh uh push and pull between wanting to

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,720
engage the community

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,080
and wanting to maintain a binary oem

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:11,039
licensing model

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,320
and so we saw we solved it with this

00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,919
sort of hybrid

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,159
licensing strategy that really didn't

00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:19,840
please anybody in fact when you look at

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:22,240
android android uh came out with uh

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,000
uh class libraries that were licensed

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,840
under uh

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,360
what what did they license it with was

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,840
it apache yeah

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,640
yeah it was apache and so and that was

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,120
because

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:34,880
they knew that that um you know all

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,919
those phone manufacturers

00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:41,280
they all wanted to be able to uh

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:43,840
mix their proprietary

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,280
cellular modems and everything else with

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,600
the open stuff

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,840
and not have to publish the source code

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,400
for it and it was kind of a non-starter

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,720
for

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,480
for them unless they bought a binary

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,440
license from sun

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,400
and that's why sun did did what they did

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,440
you want to

00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,159
add anything to that simon no no go go

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,480
carry on

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:09,280
okay okay so next slide

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,039
uh what goes into an faq so on the left

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,960
side we already talked about some of the

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,919
characteristics the transparency the

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,000
completeness

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,679
the hard questions but what topics do

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
you actually address

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,559
well think about all of the people who

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,600
are going to engage with your technology

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,440
what could possibly make things blow up

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,039
what's going to upset people what are

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,880
people going to look for

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,640
what are your goals and objectives how

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,880
is it licensed

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,400
what are the terms of participation how

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,640
does the contribution

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,240
agreements work what are the road maps

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,400
and the schedules and how

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,240
how will it be released how will the

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,120
community come together

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:49,279
uh what so what how does this play in

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,080
the overall ecosystem with competitors

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,880
etc

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,480
where do you get more information well

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,600
the faq needs to cover

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,840
all of that stuff and needs to unwrap

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,039
all of these questions to the point

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,360
where you have

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,120
really solid answers to all of this

00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,080
stuff and it all hangs together as a

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,559
sensible

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,320
overall strategy you can have a separate

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:14,159
faq for your technical

00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:16,480
usage questions but um the general faq

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,360
it doesn't replace the documentation but

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,039
it answers

00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:24,000
all these questions next slide

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:25,840
so how do you get started well this is

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,559
not an easy process you have to start

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,200
early

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,799
you build a cross-functional team where

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:33,679
everybody has the

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,200
his decision making capacity and then

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,279
you divide and conquer you take the

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,919
different pieces of the faq

00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:41,840
you uh give it to the people who are the

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:45,360
experts in your company and then

00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:49,039
you continue to meet and

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:51,600
resolve conflicts and planning issues

00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:52,640
and you engage your leadership and force

00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,039
decisions

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,520
through this process to get to a

00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:02,240
sensible strategy that's going to work

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:04,480
next slide so who should write this faq

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,440
simon what do you think well it's got to

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,799
be somebody

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:12,159
who uh is bridging the worlds of

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:15,200
technical and business uh so it can't

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,679
just be your uh your project lead it

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,200
can't

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,799
just be your uh a product owner in the

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,880
business it needs to be somebody who

00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,720
is able to sit between those two worlds

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,919
uh someone who's really good with words

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,120
and can craft

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:31,440
very carefully sprung text that that

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,799
tells the truth in a concise and

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,080
compelling way

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,880
you've got to have somebody who can

00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,640
resolve conflicts and to

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,720
bring people together and you've got to

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,440
have somebody who understands developers

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,080
and can

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,880
engage the developer community and and

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,360
uh

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,039
get trust from them and the obvious

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,640
person to do that is the person that

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:51,440
you've employed to be the community

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,600
manager

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,600
for the project that's involved you

00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,159
could do it with a centralized person

00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,120
from an

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,159
ospo the the only challenge with doing

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,440
that is that person

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,279
won't be completely uh

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,600
aware of all of the issues with the

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,720
product strategy direction and business

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,559
plan

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,080
in our case it was rick rich was the

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:15,279
perfect guy to do this

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,679
um he's he's uh uh

00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,760
aware of all the issues he is a

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:22,880
conciliator and a brick builder

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,400
uh he uh it sees conflict as an

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,640
opportunity to build

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,880
agreement and move on to the next step

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,400
and uh so he did a great job and

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,919
congratulations rich

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,760
it was really i think we got java

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,400
launched basically because you were on

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,159
board

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,000
although everybody else on the team

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,440
thought it was them as well so um

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,600
there's you know that's

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:46,320
a that's a small benefit for you

00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,320
um the other thing to to recognize is

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,000
that it's really important to have

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:53,760
the leadership of the company or at very

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,919
least the overall leadership responsible

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,720
for your product on board for this

00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,880
strategy

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,240
because this strategy is going to create

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,799
conflict in the company

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:05,039
it is going to force you to face uh the

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,960
way your community sees you honestly

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:09,360
it is going to force you to admit what

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,159
your true motivations and objectives are

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,760
openly to your team as well as probably

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,760
to the public

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,600
though that your your leadership team is

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,159
going to have to be willing to make

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,679
compromises to handle hard questions

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:23,279
otherwise you're just going to raise all

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,600
the questions from the community

00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:28,240
and you will craft for yourself the

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:31,679
weapons that are used to kill you

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:34,799
if you if you embrace this process then

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,559
you will probably need to agree to

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:39,600
surrender a little of your control of

00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:42,000
the product to the process itself

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,880
this is really hard if you're a c-level

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,720
executive

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,240
you expect to call the shots you don't

00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,679
expect to have the community or your

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,080
staff call the shots

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,720
but if you want to succeed with uh

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,039
getting your

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,159
open source software adopted for your

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,240
business benefit

00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:59,039
you're going to have to get on board and

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,600
agree with all of these things

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,640
um the other channel oh rich carry on

00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,919
yeah i just wanted to

00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,399
to mention uh changing incentives it's

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:07,919
that

00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,440
little bullet in the middle that's one

00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,120
of the toughest ones

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,120
because if you've got a product that

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,039
you've been making a ton of money on

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,200
and all of a sudden the source code to

00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,919
that product is out there for anyone to

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,360
use

00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:24,399
to fork to do whatever they want with um

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,120
well what's what are the oem sales reps

00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,760
going to do

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:28,320
when they can't buy their next mercedes

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,440
because

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:34,720
uh the uh the the uh

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,360
the oem sales business is drying up uh

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,919
well

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,000
you you need to figure out how you're

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:41,440
going to deal with that in your company

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,120
you need to figure out how you're going

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,720
to tell your investors

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,480
how you're going to continue to make

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,200
money uh with

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,399
uh an entirely new strategy i think

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,679
incentives are a really

00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:55,120
crucial uh element okay

00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,039
we're gonna need to skip on because

00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,279
we're we're almost out of time here so

00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,360
we might actually skip over some slides

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,440
um one big challenge you're going to

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,120
face is that your legal department will

00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,120
tell you that speaking openly and

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,760
honestly about your motivations your

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,080
product

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,440
is too risky and i just want to confirm

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,320
for you that it is really

00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,640
really risky um i had to appear in court

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,919
as a witness in the google oracle trial

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:22,880
and i found that uh that oracle

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:25,120
um made me do a video deposition and

00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,480
brought up our email correspondence from

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:30,320
the process of doing this

00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:32,480
faq as questions during that deposition

00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,640
that was 10 years later

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:37,279
and also the decisions we made about

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,919
open sourcing java during this process

00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,320
became key elements in the java oracle

00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,960
trial

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,799
10 years later and all of the the

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,840
materials we used in discussing it were

00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,480
produced

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,360
by both parties by google and oracle as

00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,240
evidenced during

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,799
that trial so it legal are right this is

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,039
a risky thing to do and

00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:59,600
it may well be that that risk is too big

00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:02,080
for your team to be willing to take on

00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,360
there's no sense in which writing an faq

00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,919
explaining your project

00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,039
is a trivial casual thing to set about

00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:10,399
doing

00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:11,679
um uh rich

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,640
do you want to talk about this we've got

00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,000
about two more so so at the 11th hour

00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,559
just before we uh

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,600
open sourced did the code drop for open

00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:21,440
jdk

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,279
one of the senior executives at sun

00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,240
tried to stage a coup

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:28,000
uh basically said you know i've never

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,200
really been on board with this whole

00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:33,840
uh transparency thing let's just get rid

00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,559
of that faq and do a really simple small

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,919
one

00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:39,760
uh and uh this i think illustrates why

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,320
having your leadership on board is so

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,080
important uh because uh you know there

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,039
were some people who agreed with that

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,600
executive

00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:50,559
but by then the engineering executives

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:54,000
who really uh ran the show at sun

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:56,399
were pretty well sold on uh transparency

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,760
and uh they pushed back but it took a

00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,799
few of us um

00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,320
having to threaten to quit in protest in

00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,640
order to get

00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,840
that faq published so you've got to

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,360
really be sure

00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:09,360
your leadership has your back

00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,159
next slide

00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,440
[Music]

00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,519
okay where are we oh i

00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,640
could probably skip over that rich yeah

00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,640
let's skip over this one

00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,519
so other marketing and communications um

00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,159
so

00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:33,279
uh this is one of the the side benefits

00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,640
of the faq

00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:37,279
you've actually done most of the

00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:40,559
marketing work with that faq it's a

00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:43,120
source material for all the rest of your

00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:45,440
your marketing materials uh speakers

00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,679
guides keynotes etc

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,880
so when all of the questions have clear

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,880
and true answers

00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,159
and you can just point people at them

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:58,559
you save a lot of time and effort

00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,559
next okay so um

00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,399
oh that's another one of yours uh you're

00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,559
going backwards

00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,840
well i went backwards i'm that's getting

00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:08,399
getting spooked here

00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,039
so did it all work well uh you'll

00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,519
remember

00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,159
back at the beginning of this process um

00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,919
the

00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,080
one of the challenges we faced was that

00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:19,200
richard stallman had written an article

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,960
uh that uh called the java trap that

00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,760
utterly condemned us in the

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,000
most corrupt skating and a plain way

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:29,440
which only richard is able to master

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:32,720
and at the end of that process um we got

00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,720
to uh to this

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,840
the gnu general public license is the

00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,039
most popular most widely used free

00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,519
software license

00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:47,600
the special thing about this license is

00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:50,159
that it's a copyleft license

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:53,120
that is to say all versions of the

00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:56,080
program must carry the same license

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,840
so the freedoms that the new gpl gives

00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,720
to the users

00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,720
must reach all the users of the program

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,039
and that's the purpose for which i wrote

00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,120
it

00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:07,200
it'll be very good that the java trap

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,320
won't exist anymore it'll be a thing of

00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:11,360
the past

00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,679
that kind of problem can still exist in

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,240
other areas but it won't exist for java

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,279
anymore

00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,760
i think sun has will

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:21,600
with this contribution have contributed

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,480
more than any other company

00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,159
to the free software community in the

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,760
form of software

00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:32,960
and it shows leadership it's an example

00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,960
i hope others will follow

00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:44,799
[Music]

00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:46,559
um so the output of this was uh we

00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:47,360
actually did persuade richard stallman

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,720
to write to

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:54,399
record a promotional video for sun um

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:57,679
promoting uh open source java um which

00:33:54,399 --> 00:34:00,960
um really was beyond our expectations at

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:04,720
the time i think it's fair to say rich

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:07,760
yeah it's pretty remarkable uh you know

00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,159
richard stallman uh uh

00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:11,200
didn't change his mind all that often

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,720
yeah uh

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,919
we we uh we solved uh we got him to

00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:19,040
change his mind

00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:20,960
by being completely transparent

00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,800
about what we were doing and why we were

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,599
doing it all right

00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,760
so we're pretty much out of time here uh

00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:31,280
if you look at the rest of the slides

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:34,639
um uh you'll find a how-to

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:37,919
in how to do the faq and

00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:40,960
both rich and i will be very pleased to

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:43,040
work with you on preparing this strategy

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,359
if you wish

00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:48,000
it is a big undertaking and you need to

00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:50,320
have your management lined up carefully

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,159
and you need to make sure that you are

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,639
as authentic as possible

00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:56,879
because ultimately authenticity is the

00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,720
key to using an faq to manage that

00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:01,040
corporate community boundary

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,079
uh telling the truth and making it clear

00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,520
that you are indeed

00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,760
telling the truth and taking the

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,320
questions seriously is ultimately the

00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,040
key

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,680
to your being successfully accepted rich

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,400
has written

00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,280
uh as you would expect the mother of all

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,160
faqs

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,520
about writing the mother of all faqs and

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:20,480
there's a link

00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,560
to his resources just there and a number

00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,599
of other resources are available

00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,040
and apart from that please do feel free

00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,280
to email us

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,599
if you've got any further questions do

00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:45,839
you have any final words rich

00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:45,839
nope that's it

00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,880
