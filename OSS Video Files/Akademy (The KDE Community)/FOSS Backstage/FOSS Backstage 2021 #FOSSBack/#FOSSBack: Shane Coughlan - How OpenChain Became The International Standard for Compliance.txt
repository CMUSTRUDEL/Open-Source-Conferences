Title: #FOSSBack: Shane Coughlan - How OpenChain Became The International Standard for Compliance
Publication date: 2021-02-25
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	This talk will explore the process of building and deploying the first Linux Foundation ISO standard in fourteen years in collaboration with the Joint Development Foundation. It will explain why the evolution from de facto industry standard to formal standardization was important for open source compliance in the context of areas like sale, procurement and M&A. An equal amount of time will be spent providing a guide to the journey itself, as the lessons learned are applicable to all projects building out specifications or code that seek worldwide, lasting adoption across multiple industries. The standardization process will be framed in the context of timely engagement, with SPDX queued to be the second Joint Development Foundation PAS submission behind OpenChain, and everyone involved ready to support more projects undertaking a similar journey in the months and years ahead. In practical terms, this talk will allow the audience to come away with a clear understanding of how we will take open source and standards to the next level.

	00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,120
when i started

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,040
things like license compliance was still

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,599
a little bit uncertain

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,400
uh there was some ambiguity around

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,800
whether

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,680
actual litigation in court would be

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,880
effective with licenses

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:26,240
and of course thanks to

00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:30,560
time from individuals like harold velter

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,920
thanks to law firms like jbb led by till

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,640
yeager

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,640
those issues were ironed out and open

00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,160
source licensing became a lot

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:43,040
clearer a lot easier to understand

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,960
now in recent years a lot of the

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,160
discussion around open source license

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,239
compliance

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,440
has been about how to make it as

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,760
consistent

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,199
as effective and as efficient as

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,440
possible

00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,760
so of course when we're dealing with say

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,239
commercial use of open source

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,840
we do have to try to make sure that very

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,159
long supply chains

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,760
can have effective open source license

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,439
compliance

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,600
and that is not as simple as telling

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,560
people they should know the terms of the

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,000
license and they should use it

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,080
it requires a great deal of education

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,600
and it requires effective process

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,880
management

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,520
so in some ways in 15 years we've swung

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,640
from the

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,119
advocacy and basic proof phase

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,960
into the process management phase of

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,479
open source license compliance

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,479
and more generally open source

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:37,280
governance

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,520
and that introduces some complexity but

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,520
it also introduces clarity

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,759
and today i want to talk about how we

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,560
actually have created an iso standard

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,240
for open source license compliance

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,680
where it comes from where it's going and

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,920
what that means for you

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,520
whether you're an individual developer

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,159
you're a small company or a

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,759
multinational

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,880
so to get started around 2015

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:06,000
a discussion kicked off between

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,879
various lawyers mostly at the time

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,080
about what would be the key requirements

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,640
of an open source

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,160
compliance program you know what are the

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,319
absolute must-haves

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,239
and various approaches to outlining

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,360
those key requirements were

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,239
noodled people thought what if we had

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,599
checklists explaining everything and

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,680
then people

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,520
reanalyzed it and said a checklist will

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,120
be inherently suitable for a certain

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,519
company size

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,360
and market sector how do we make this

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,560
universal

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,239
so by 2016 the open chain project was

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,760
formally created

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:46,720
and designed to do this to create a

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,840
clear short specification that outlined

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,160
the key requirements of open source

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,360
compliance

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,680
without making it burdensome without

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,480
making it market specific

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,480
and without making it company size

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,720
specific

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,159
now people are very familiar often with

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,760
things like open source

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:10,560
tooling for instance fossology

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,599
turn we have things like reuse software

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,239
as an approach to managing software

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,879
a little higher than that up in the

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,280
stack

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,080
more abstract you've got software bill

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,560
of materials like spdx

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,760
now open chain decided to take the very

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,799
top level

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,959
the high level process management and to

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,680
focus the energy there

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,959
in other words open chain is designed to

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,040
set the foundation

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,280
and the framework where people apply

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,760
software of materials

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,239
tooling and so on so the idea

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,239
that was implemented is to define

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,959
inflection points

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,840
and in the particular case of open chain

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,959
to define

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,439
in a company at what inflection point

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,560
do you need to put a process so you know

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,560
inbound

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,159
understand what software is coming in

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,239
under what license

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,159
internally have training policy and

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,159
processes and outbound

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,519
understand what's going out under what

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,000
license

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,159
these are very foundational things but

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,479
it's very important to clearly

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,120
describe them so that companies can

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,560
implement in process management

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,960
and whether they're doing it through

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,960
pre-existing

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,199
software management processes or they're

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,199
implementing it for the first time

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,280
this frames what they do at open source

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,600
licensing

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,440
and the goal for open chain is to make

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,280
the supply chain

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,280
more conformant to make sure that

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,600
mistakes don't occur

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,639
so company by company as people adopt

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,479
open chain

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,960
the chance of errors is dramatically

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,400
reduced and just as important

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,800
because everyone's using the same

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,320
process management if something happens

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,600
you can go very quickly through the

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,479
supply chain

00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,080
and find out where there's a broken link

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,120
and fix it

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,400
so this essentially dramatically reduces

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,800
complexity

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,280
and increases efficiency two of the

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,840
major things we needed to get done

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,520
to really get this solved and just as a

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,479
side note

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,479
the supply chain is enormously complex

00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,520
it's quite rare to have a product come

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,680
to market

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,120
that isn't touched by 20 or more

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,039
companies

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,560
so it's really vital that we have a

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:30,080
methodology for doing this

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:33,840
now open chain went to market in uh

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:37,120
october 2016. and

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,880
by april 2019

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,039
we'd had a few iterations of the

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,520
standard we had enormous

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,840
growth in terms of community engagement

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,199
from companies and also multiple sector

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,960
growth

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,600
so it was very clear the standard was

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:54,160
working the current iteration was solid

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,840
and it was time to think about how we

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,759
turn it from a de facto industry

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:02,880
standard into a formal

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:05,840
international standard so in april 2020

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,360
we submitted it into a special process

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,400
in iso

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:13,680
where you literally convert an indus

00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,919
uh de facto industry standard into a

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,600
formal standard so it's not a re-editing

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,680
process or anything like that it's a

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,240
conversion process

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,560
submitted in april last year we

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,600
graduated in december

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,600
and therefore we now have an iso

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,919
standard for open source license

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,680
compliance

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,280
now let's talk about what that really

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,720
means

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,759
so at the very basic level if people

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,800
are conforming to iso 5230

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,720
or open chain 2.1 you know that they

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,400
have the key requirements of a quality

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,680
open source compliance program

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:54,400
in place that ranges from training

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,360
the appropriate people through to having

00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:01,599
internal and external touch points for

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:04,400
compliance questions these

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,400
facts are very useful to know both for

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,360
anyone who wants to ask the company a

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,360
question

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,560
or internally for the company's staff

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,560
who need to respond

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,160
the type of entities supporting this

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,759
international

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,520
standard are very diverse so here's

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,440
the platinum members of the project

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,960
these are the board companies

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,039
and as you can see it's everyone from

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,360
silicon with arm and qualcomm

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,680
through to cloud where companies like

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,680
google and microsoft

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,599
and the diversity of these companies in

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,440
market sector

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,759
is only the beginning of the

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,160
illustration of how diverse the actual

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,199
project is there's many hundreds of

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,240
companies involved plenty of individuals

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,240
involved

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,919
and when it comes to market sectors when

00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,319
it comes to industry areas it's

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:55,280
remarkable

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,919
i'll give you two examples just for fun

00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,280
one

00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:02,560
is that a few months ago an ethical bank

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:05,840
in myanmar became open chain conformant

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,759
uh another major major engagement with

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,000
open chain and contributor

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,919
has been philip morris international in

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,280
switzerland because of their work on the

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,759
ikios electric

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,680
cigarette you know we're talking about a

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,479
massive diversity of companies all

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,440
around the world

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:24,080
being touched by the international

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,440
standard for open source compliance

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,120
of course the platinum members are the

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,240
key driver of this

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:33,279
uh but the community as a whole has

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,919
terrific local activity terrific subject

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,880
matter

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:39,120
groups and uh the outreach is

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,800
exceptional

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,959
so when it comes to companies that are

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,080
adopting the open chain standard

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:48,560
um it varies it moves really quickly

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,360
and not all companies get listed on our

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,760
website

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,440
uh it's an optional thing but here are

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,560
some examples of people

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,800
using iso right now

00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,600
or equivalent so it's companies like

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,680
toyota

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,279
it's companies like cisco it's microsoft

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,160
and so on

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,920
and these companies of course are

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,360
influencing their supply chains and

00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,120
accelerating the adoption

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,560
and that helps clean up everything for

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,080
everyone

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,959
now there's also companies who are

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,120
conforment with previous versions

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,399
of the specification before it was ready

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,880
for iso

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,839
and some of them are converting so one

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,120
company that

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,519
just converted on this slide is hitachi

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,320
which just announced a couple of days

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,399
ago

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,360
that they've moved to the iso conformant

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,680
program

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,959
and we've got a bunch more announcements

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,519
in the pipeline

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,399
it's exciting it's great and we're very

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,480
glad

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,519
uh to see companies not only adopting

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,320
open chain

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:48,560
but gradually coalescing around the iso

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,080
standard itself

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,000
now i mentioned the community is

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,080
incredible and it is

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,800
so we have a global mailing list with

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,720
almost 4 000 subscribers

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,399
uh we've got global automotive and

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,839
reference tooling work groups

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,760
the reference tooling work group

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,760
actually meets every two weeks which is

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,160
exceptionally frequent

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,440
we've got china japan korea taiwan

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,720
germany and u.s

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,760
work groups and we have

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,640
just recently added first of all an

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,640
education

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,760
work group for the globe and also an

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,320
indian work group

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,240
for a local region a significant local

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,800
region

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,560
and these these communities aren't just

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:31,360
talking they're creating stuff like

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:35,680
supplier education leaflets

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:40,160
new types of checklists and so on

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:43,360
so let's explain what i meant by that

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:46,959
the standard is a specification

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,079
it's basically seven relatively widely

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,040
spaced

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:53,760
uh pages of text saying you should do

00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,000
this to accomplish this

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,800
and you can read the standard to adopt

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,880
it

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,000
or you can use something like our online

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,440
self-certification

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,560
questionnaire which is free and private

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,480
people use it actually for

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,399
self-certification but more generally

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,519
for health checks and anyone can go

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,800
there and

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:15,440
join in but when it comes to actually

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,680
doing that adopting a standard whether

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,440
you choose to read the specification or

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,279
to use our self-certification

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:24,720
questionnaire

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:26,800
people often have a lot of questions

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,120
we aren't prescriptive we don't say you

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,720
have to have this training program

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,600
or that open source policy like i said

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,399
any company

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:40,399
any size any market any culture

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,240
but we do try to provide reference

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,079
material to help people answer the

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,880
questions and answer yes

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,640
and if they can't answer yes today they

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,800
can pick up some reference material and

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,760
build from there

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,440
the material is extremely comprehensive

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,079
from case studies with companies like

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,320
toyota

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,560
to reference training slides built out

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:04,560
of information from qualcomm

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:07,680
samsung philips arm and others

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,720
to translations in multiple languages

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,560
we keep a bunch of it on the website for

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,720
example the curriculum and supplier

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,959
education is first touch once you get to

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,040
our website

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,440
but it's really on github where you'll

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,880
find just the epic amount of material

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:27,600
contributed from all over the world as

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,959
companies and individuals and law firms

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,200
share the information

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,639
so that anyone can get references about

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,160
pretty much anything

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,480
when it comes to open source compliance

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,600
it's it's well worth a look at that um

00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,440
and it's in

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,360
multiple languages not everything is

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,200
translated by everyone it tends to be

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,320
communities translate their stuff of

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,680
interest

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:52,720
but it's certainly significant and uh

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,560
apart from the specification itself

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,760
and apart from the case studies where

00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:00,000
it's like toyota did

00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:03,040
this everything else

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,480
is public domain it's

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:09,200
cc0 this is a purposeful

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,040
step on our poor part because we want

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,399
people to incorporate all the knowledge

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,600
anywhere they want

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,120
without any restrictions uh and that's

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,720
been tremendously successful

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,760
tremendously successful now

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,279
the project is companies solving their

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,279
own problem

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,440
but part of that discussion is also

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:32,240
being how do we get support

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,160
how do we make sure that let's say a

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,320
small company in germany

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,320
who is working on open source licensed

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,800
compliance now they're adopting open

00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,680
chain

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,560
but they have a question who do they ask

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,639
it to

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,600
and we've worked to build out a partner

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,560
program

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,839
with entities that have information

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,160
about open source

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,079
have information about open chain and

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,720
have made a clear commitment

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,320
to explaining open chain to their

00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,040
customer base and the people who come

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,240
along

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,720
so here's an example of law firms

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,600
i mentioned till in his law firm jbb in

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,800
germany it's

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,320
an exceptional exceptional law firm id

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,560
law partners in spain

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,760
is another example gtc in the united

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:18,160
states

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:20,399
osborne clark uk array law italy

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,000
all over the world law firms with a lot

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,800
of experience in this field and some

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,920
great people are available to help

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,360
we also now work with a lot of service

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,399
providers

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:35,680
each of the service providers here has

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,720
engaged with the project they've come to

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,880
understand it

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,560
and they've reached agreements with us

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:43,279
regarding how they will

00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,399
both explain and advocate open chain and

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:48,000
the

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,600
the optics the way they'll do that

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,519
and of course we have some vendors and

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,880
so on most of the tooling vendors are

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,600
relatively recent

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,720
to the open chain program and just like

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,120
everyone else

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,399
they've committed to both understanding

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,240
clearly what we do

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,839
and also understanding things like the

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,720
open chain project

00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,000
doesn't recommend anything in particular

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,639
of course

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,639
but you know by and large are user

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,560
companies when they talk about tooling

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,959
are mostly talking about open source

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,600
tooling for open source compliance

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,040
and our tooling vendors are fully aware

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,519
of that

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:26,000
and they know that when it comes to

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,760
let's say talking about tooling

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,079
what we really want to do is make sure

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:32,560
there's perfect interoperability

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,920
it should be perfectly possible to scan

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,000
with phostology

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,519
in one place in your company scan with

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,600
white source in another

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,440
use foss id elsewhere and all the

00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,000
information just to flow perfectly

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,720
through

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,279
all of that stuff using something like

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,639
ingest

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:50,639
and export up spdx and we've got third

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,920
party certifiers

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,079
so i'm not going to go into too much

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,959
detail on that but basically

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,000
you can self-certify to the standard or

00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,839
you can get help

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,639
or you can literally get someone to do

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:06,160
it for you like pricewaterhousecooper or

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:07,440
said it's been really cool on the third

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,320
party certification

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,199
we honestly don't expect that to be by

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,720
any measure

00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:15,600
the majority of what happens in the

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,920
project self-certification we believe

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,920
will always be the majority and then

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,480
independent

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,240
assessment support and then much smaller

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,560
third-party certification

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,279
but in areas like automotive aviation

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,120
defense

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,880
it's very important to have third-party

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,680
certification and we already have it

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,639
we're really

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,000
glad that before we became an iso

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,519
standard we had all of this

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,959
in place so when it comes to adopting a

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,800
standard like this

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,240
i mentioned different ways

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,399
self-certification is

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,920
where you literally do it yourself and

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,360
that's what a lot of people do

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,199
a lot of companies do that like i'll

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,839
give you an example microsoft did that

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:59,199
they self-certified so did google

00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,680
um so did qualcomm so did arm

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,240
but some companies want to have someone

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,160
come in

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,600
and double check the self-certification

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,919
maybe offer some advice

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,160
it could be a law firm it could be a

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,919
service provider like wipro

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,640
and that's independent compliance

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:17,520
assessment where someone just drops in

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,600
helps you out or in some cases maybe

00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,880
your customer company said oh

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,679
thank you supplier it's great that

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,720
you're self-certified but i want to have

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,799
jbb just check you out and then there's

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,840
third party certification where

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,480
someone does it for you and naturally

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,080
you can

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,240
see that self-certification is the

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,200
cheapest and then it gets more expensive

00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,960
from there

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,559
but those people who are investing in

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,400
third party certification

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,559
it's a significant part of their market

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,640
requirements

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,480
now i do have details about what each of

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,400
these things is but

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,080
i'm going to skim over that just to say

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,280
that self-certification is

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:58,480
the heart of open chain you know this is

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,200
vitally important it works and it's

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,400
available

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:05,200
at this url anytime for anyone company

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:08,080
individual whatever go play

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,919
and when we were starting 2016 there

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,360
were some concerns

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:15,760
will people misuse self-certification

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,120
will they say that they are certified

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,559
when they're not

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,760
and after now amazingly about five years

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,200
in market

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,960
uh the answer is no in fact the problem

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,080
if any that we've had is that people

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,640
tend to overshoot

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,080
rather than undershoot so people tend to

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,440
go process heavy

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:38,000
rather than process light and we began

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,520
to have anyone

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,120
misrepresent what they're doing in

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,960
self-certification

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,640
i think it's probably because one of the

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,799
parts of our self-certification the

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,200
final part basically says

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:50,960
uh document how you did it and that

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,160
means any customer company can just be

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,440
like okay show me that

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,039
show me that documentation independent

00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,799
assessment like i said

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:02,240
someone comes in law firm consultancy

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,080
accounting firm

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,160
and they just see what you did and they

00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,880
might have some suggestions

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,760
uh this is very popular in some areas we

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,840
actually

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,600
to be honest borrowed this from

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,720
functional safety

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,520
where the iso 26262

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,160
functional safety standard explicitly

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,320
has

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:26,160
uh independent compliances while

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:29,120
independent security assessment for them

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,160
and uh yeah it's it's actually pretty

00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,679
popular

00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,240
i think a lot of companies like the

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:37,280
sanity check of having someone

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,039
saying what they think and it's cost

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,360
efficient as well you know you can pay

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:44,000
for as much as you want

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,799
the third-party certification i'll just

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,160
give an example

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:50,160
pwc has a whole software um asset

00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,600
management platform

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,960
and they can implement the processes for

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,760
you

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,360
so that you'll be open chain conformant

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,600
and third party certified

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,840
and whether it's pwc or tip said they're

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,400
going to give you a literal certificate

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,280
saying that they certified you uh you

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,640
know

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,400
like i said i think that's really

00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,080
something for automotive aviation

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,679
defense those kind of people it's not

00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,440
something that would be super common in

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,480
consumer electronics

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:22,240
probably let's see let's see

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:26,080
but the big point is this

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:28,240
we have built a standard that identifies

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,200
the actual inflection points where

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,559
things can go wrong where we know things

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,280
have gone wrong

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,320
and we know that if people put processes

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,039
here

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,360
things are much less likely to go wrong

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,880
and

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,000
much more likely to be fixed so it's a

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:47,120
very

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,600
simple elegant idea and

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,080
after all these years in market we know

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,760
that self-certification is working well

00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,159
and having enormous companies like

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:59,039
toyota self-certify

00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:02,000
is proof of scaling and it inspires the

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:06,000
rest of the automotive industry

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:08,080
we have built support for this project

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,919
all of that reference material all of

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,200
the stuff like the partners

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:15,280
who explicitly work with us on this

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,960
and we seek to make sure everyone's got

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,159
freedom of choice to get license

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,960
compliance right

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,400
but there's no ambiguity in the process

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,360
process management

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,280
that people need and if there's one

00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:29,440
thing i'd like you to take away

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,720
it's that open chain project is run by

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,640
user companies for

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,200
user companies and these are the people

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,240
with the problem solving the problem

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,720
and this means an extremely clear

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,159
extremely effective vision for getting

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,720
this right

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,520
as few problems as possible likely to

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,799
occur

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,159
as quick remediation as possible likely

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:53,919
to occur

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,559
and of course clarity so so much less is

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:57,600
spent on

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,679
digging through uncertainty and bespoke

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,000
approaches

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,600
we'd love for you to be part of this

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,520
individual or company

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,440
every mind counts you can join our

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,880
community by going to the open chain

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,480
project website

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,000
and like i said you can go to the self

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,520
certification or health check

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,280
and just play around with it and see

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,360
what the standard's like

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:20,000
what the questions are go have a look at

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:23,440
our reference material

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,880
and there i wrap it up i think sam gave

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,000
me a

00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,159
a 10 minute warning there uh so

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,840
we've got about five left i suppose for

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,840
any questions if you have them

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,120
thank you so much shane we do have a

00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,280
little extra time for questions and this

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,880
is a broad and potentially

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,640
technical topic which affects many of

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,520
the audience members directly i

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,400
imagine i'm not seeing questions just

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,080
yet

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,679
please go ahead and add them in the chat

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,679
or in the questions tab

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,440
and in the meantime i have a question

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,400
for you shane which is about the number

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,679
of firms

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,760
which i've seen increasingly selling uh

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,320
compliance services for open source

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,880
firms like white source fossa sneak

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,320
uh i'm sure you're aware of these and

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,039
some of their marketing and i wonder

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,360
whether you

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,799
feel that they're solving genuine

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,320
important legal issues these companies

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,559
are helping with compliance of different

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,919
kinds including potentially open chain

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,840
or if you feel that they're adding

00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,360
unnecessary doubt to the to the sector

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,799
like do they complement your work with

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,000
open chain or how does the commercial

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,720
ecosystem fit

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,840
i like that question i think uh the

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:36,880
history of the commercial ecosystem

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,720
has been relatively negative so 10 years

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,960
ago a lot of the service providers were

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,039
using extremely negative language about

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,559
open source compliance

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:47,520
so my perspective is that started in a

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,480
bad place

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,919
um and i i certainly wasn't happy with

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,840
the marketing i saw

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,679
15 years ago 10 years ago it was

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,320
basically open source is dangerous we'll

00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,159
help constrain it for you

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,559
i think that the messaging has gone like

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,120
a lot better i think user companies got

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,360
tired

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,720
of the endless negativity and they just

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,400
didn't believe it i mean

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,640
it's very hard to tell a major

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,159
corporation using open source

00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,159
that it's a terrible thing if they've

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,760
spent a decade knowing it's not

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,400
and i think that has helped change the

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,000
market message in the context of open

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,080
chain

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,240
our strategy with working with vendors

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,480
is to bring them in

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,320
with our partner agreement and

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,559
essentially

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,679
frame their services in the context of

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,400
open chain

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,200
in the way that we talk about open chain

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,279
so

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,240
we're trying to encourage the companies

00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:41,520
to have

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,200
a non-negative messaging to focus on

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,520
actually solving the problems like let's

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,760
say can we have discoverability

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,320
not that open source is dangerous but do

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:52,720
we have adequate discoverability

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,760
and to be honest i think that is a

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,360
pretty

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,720
good long-term strategy i mean the

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,000
companies have been moving away from

00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,159
negativity and talking about

00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,840
optimization for a while

00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,200
but i think things like open chain will

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,840
boost

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,440
positive discussion particularly because

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,159
if there's one thing open chain

00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,039
is prescriptive about is that people

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,799
should have choice

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,240
interoperability should just work and if

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,600
people aren't doing that there's

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,640
something wrong

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,039
and you know i've said it to all our

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,000
tooling vendors in the ecosystem

00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:22,400
companies like

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,600
synopsis with black duck or white source

00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,320
foss id

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,440
you know ultimately they're going to

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,279
have to have

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,520
transparent interoperability between

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:33,679
each other and the open source tools

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,200
in the future because that's where we're

00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,840
going i mean we've got

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,039
over 160 companies in the tooling work

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,400
group

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,600
those companies are working on open

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,960
source tooling for open source

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,360
compliance and whether it's

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,240
you know ort or its fossology or scan

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,600
code

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,080
they want it perfectly interoperable so

00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,919
yeah i do think that vendors were in a

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,600
pretty bad place a decade ago

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,440
i think it's getting a lot better i

00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,360
think i think things like the open chain

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,200
partner program

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,760
will align the vendors around the

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:07,120
interoperability and positive messaging

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:08,480
because well

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,159
i mean these are the user companies

00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,279
coalesced we've literally made the

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,159
standard

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,360
uh kind of it's like people have to work

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,440
with that now

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:20,159
and i want to give credit i mean

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:23,520
companies like blackduck

00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:25,200
synopsis jumped in to open chain very

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,440
enthusiastically they've hauled

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,640
multiple webinars actively promoting

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,799
open chain

00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,320
uh not in the sense of you must use

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,320
black duck but more in the sense of this

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:36,159
is where the industry's going okay

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,440
and that's great i think that's exactly

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,200
what we want to see

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,960
white source is new we're just about to

00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,200
kick off some webinars with them and i

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,480
expect exactly the same

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,480
but anyway the big picture is open chain

00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,360
is agnostic regarding what you do in

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,320
automation

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,919
but we're going to make sure that it

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,520
suits the user companies

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,440
that means interoperability it means

00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,240
realistic uh

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,400
risk assessment it means not pretending

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,159
that this is terribly dangerous

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,480
but at the same time not pretending that

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:10,159
we can ignore licenses

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:12,960
so yeah the message is getting better

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,720
that's encouraging thanks and we have a

00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,279
question also from lawrence

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,200
about the self-certification process he

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,200
asks if there's any approval given

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,120
by the open chain project itself at the

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,279
end of that self-serve process

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,960
nope nothing i mean you just tell us

00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,720
you're self-certified and that's it and

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,039
there is actually a reason for that

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,640
we purposefully decided to use economics

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,480
to police the standard

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,039
okay so ultimately it's a supply chain

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,520
standard if you are a company in the

00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:41,200
supply chain and you self-certify

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,880
now your customer companies know they

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:45,440
can ask you for the section six

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,720
materials to see what you did

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,480
so the fact is that if you're

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,360
self-certified if you're talking about

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,960
it

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,520
at some point in the commercial

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,360
agreements your customers will say

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,360
okay show me the what we call the

00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,039
compliance artifacts

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,279
so this is how we use the economics to

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,720
do it we don't spend a lot of money our

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,720
budget is

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,080
at the moment it's 20 members 20 000

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,880
each 400 000

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,240
a year and that means there's no way we

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,559
could do something like

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,600
audit companies on our own but the

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,679
economic

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,799
uh audit has been super effective you

00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,640
know suppliers

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,480
are very happy to be open chain

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,720
conformant but

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,320
i've never met a supplier which was

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,200
blase about it

00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,880
uh that you know was not aware that at

00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,000
any minute a customer could say

00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,000
show me the artifacts

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,000
and so you've just been discussing there

00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,880
like suppliers and

00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,919
contract law which mandates the use of

00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,399
open chain

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,720
is that the primary or only use case

00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,399
because i'm thinking of startups or

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,720
smaller organizations or maybe even open

00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:50,399
source projects who are

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,440
compliant but they may not have

00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:55,200
contracts to enforce this either

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,240
their compliance or the compliance of

00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,320
other organizations they may have

00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,080
partnerships with yes

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,840
uh so i think when it comes to the

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,840
supply chain you basically have

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,760
the sales cycle which is more of your

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,760
advertising copy so companies like wind

00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,520
river saying we're open chain conformant

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,960
you've procurement cycle which is likely

00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,360
to go into contracts

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,480
but we see open chain used in merger and

00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,320
acquisitions

00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,159
so both in terms of let's see what this

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,679
company has in process and

00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,440
also i've noticed in terms of let's

00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,399
negotiate down their price if they made

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,720
mistakes

00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:26,640
which is again good because it's in the

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,679
economics once it gets there it doesn't

00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,679
go away

00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,919
but it can also apply to projects and

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,000
actually we're noodling on

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,000
uh digging further into open chain for

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,399
projects it's perfectly viable it's just

00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,600
a series of process points

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:43,279
and uh we there are standards like cii

00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,320
best practices badge which

00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:48,080
is security biased and quite detailed

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,080
uh but we think there might be value for

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:53,440
projects in having the

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:55,600
process inflection points and ultimately

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,240
final upstream is probably where we

00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,240
should land

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,720
so speaking to your previous answer

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,640
jamie clark asks for

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,320
uh yeah he's asking about the general

00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,600
negativity in the corporate realm

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,039
towards open source which is quite

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,320
historical and i'm sure open chain has

00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,240
already done a lot to

00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,080
to help with because of providing these

00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,960
clear standards and getting them

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,880
certified

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,640
uh by iso do you have anything to say

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,440
about that from your own perspective

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,159
about uh

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,039
turning around negativity and fear i

00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,279
actually do

00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,039
i have not encountered any significant

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,799
amount of corporate negativity towards

00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,880
open source

00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:33,120
and this is ideal with many hundreds of

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,880
companies uh what i find

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,640
is that there's often a disconnect where

00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,320
open source developers fear that

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,919
companies are up to something

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,600
and for the most part companies are up

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,120
to trying to work out how to use this

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,279
fast and cheap

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,840
so it's i i have not encountered

00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:50,000
corporate negativity towards open source

00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,360
with the exception of 10 or 15 years ago

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,440
dealing with banks or

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,640
you know telcos which had no idea what

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,480
this was

00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,559
but i i can't think of a single company

00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,799
i've bumped into in the last five years

00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,480
that's negative i have met companies

00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,159
that are confused

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,760
but that's a different story so i think

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,679
we need to get rid of that we need to

00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,919
get rid of the idea of this

00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,120
war between developers and companies

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,519
it's not real

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,640
um if it is i would have seen it in

00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:16,240
action

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,360
i'm confident of saying that because i

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:22,000
deal with so many companies

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:23,360
but i get it developers don't have great

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,159
channels into companies

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,559
and without that misunderstandings occur

00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,440
and

00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:31,279
the blame is that we don't have the

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,000
perfect meeting place between companies

00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,240
and developers

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,880
yet i mean linux foundation has events

00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:39,039
we've got events like fosdem

00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,080
but we don't have a great bridge between

00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,200
corporate management

00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,960
and high-level independent developers i

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,399
would love to work on that in the future

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,640
that would have to be outside of open

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:50,399
chain though

00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,399
what might that bridge look like would

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:55,679
it be technical tooling processes

00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:57,200
or or what how do you imagine that

00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,200
there was a wonderful comment from an

00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,720
elderly japanese man who was asked how

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,840
do we

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,679
stop war and he said we have our

00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,919
children play together

00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,039
i think if we had conferences with high

00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,120
level developers

00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:13,360
independent developers and high level

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,440
management executives

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,440
i think that would work i don't think it

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,120
would work just everyone gets together

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,640
and there's 10 000 people

00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,960
but if we brought together the right

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,080
minds i think that would fix it because

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,760
people would suddenly realize that

00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,840
there's no

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,840
real barrier except they don't meet

00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,760
