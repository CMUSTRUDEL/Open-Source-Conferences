uh

00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,440
as richard mentioned my name is tracy

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,920
evans and i'm

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,040
a partner and co-founder of open

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,920
strategy partners

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,480
and i'd like to talk to you today about

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,279
trust

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,880
the 10 ways to build better connections

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,760
and also build better businesses and

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,760
better communities

00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:26,800
[Music]

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,519
osp was born out of some conversations

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,679
and strong ideas about communication

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,880
that has now become our communication

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,960
model which underpins everything we do

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,920
and it's called authentic communication

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,800
and it's based on

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,520
three elements that we see here empathy

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,520
clarity

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,600
and trust um and so

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,760
based on that i naturally gravitate

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,239
towards any material written

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,280
on these topics and i got the

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,360
inspiration

00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,360
for this talk from a book written by

00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,160
canada's former governor general

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,719
david johnston uh the book was called uh

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,239
trust

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:08,240
20 20 ways to build a better country

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:10,400
and in this book he uh he implores us

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,080
to see that trust is gained through our

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,720
actions and decisions

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,400
on our doing and not merely saying on

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,080
the basis that can be observed and

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,400
measured rationally

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,200
as a quote from the book and he really

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,439
wants us to

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,439
explore the attitudes habits and

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,880
approaches that people

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,640
that make people businesses

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,799
organizations and countries

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,920
uh trustworthy and it was really

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,360
interesting and

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,680
i highly recommend the book um

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,240
so in this talk i'd like to share with

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,159
you ten very practical tips um to

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,880
mindfully build stress

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,840
trust not stress uh trust into your

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,640
communications

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,920
and also to make the argument that if we

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,880
put actions like these

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,079
at the core of how we communicate that

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,320
we can build better

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,320
connections businesses and communities

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,960
um so let's step back for a second

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,000
and think about why trust actually

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,800
matters

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,400
and my theory or philosophy is that

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,040
more and more people are making

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,239
values-based decisions

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,200
including but especially around where

00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,440
they work

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,360
where they contribute and definitely

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,560
what tools and services

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,400
they use or support um

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,239
and i would argue that trust is one of

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,680
the most important underlying values

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,800
that influence peop

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,720
people's choices and for people to

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,840
engage with your company your project

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,599
your product

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,640
they need to connect with you and to do

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,640
that they need trust

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:53,360
so what is trust um of course we

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,319
uh need the oxford definition of trust

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,280
and that's

00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:00,480
um the firm belief in the reliability

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,560
truth or ability of someone or something

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,640
um but actually it's far more

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,120
complicated than that um that's a really

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,480
simplistic view

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,720
trust is an often overlooked phenomenon

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,400
but it's an important one that's worth

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,280
deeper consideration

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,879
in my opinion trust is especially

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,360
important in how we communicate the

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,680
value

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,519
of open source technology products and

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,080
services

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,360
the value of which is highly complex and

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,080
often abstract

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,000
and where the story around a given set

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,519
of features and benefits can be told

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:40,879
in a multitude of ways um

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:40,879
that's a really important view to have

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,720
um so i really like stephen covey's

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,640
model of trust

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,920
to me it stands the test of time and it

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,239
fits very well

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,760
with open source technology products and

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,599
services

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,040
when we look at his model we can see

00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,480
that it breaks down into

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:03,680
two main categories competence and

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,439
character and

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,439
on the competent side it solves the

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,840
questions uh things like

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,760
can you solve my problem can you solve

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,480
it better than any alternative

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,160
and can i expect a high level of

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,320
knowledge and experience to be baked

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,680
into your product or service

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,720
um and then over on the character side

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,759
um it looks more at things like you know

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,120
do your values

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,400
align with mine and

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,000
this question i'd like to break this

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,520
down into three different types of

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,720
values

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,600
those being moral technical and

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,520
business values so for example with

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,840
moral values

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,720
the question can be do they source their

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,880
materials in a sustainable way

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,360
do they pay fair wages do they have a

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,360
diverse recruiting culture

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,800
on technical values it could be things

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,960
like

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,800
do they and how do they use open source

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,160
and open standards does it align with

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,199
the way that we use it

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,759
um do they treat users data with respect

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,759
uh did they use devops practices um to

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:12,000
get highly technical

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,680
um uh on the third type of value the

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,400
business values it can answer things

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,400
like

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,400
is your business model competitive is it

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,919
transparent is it fair

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:25,520
um and do you communicate in an open

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,479
and authentic way um this sort of

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,400
structured

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,160
catalog of questions is something that

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,120
you should be visiting at both the

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,080
strategic level

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,800
as well as the content production level

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,240
um

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,840
this should really come through in both

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,840
of those practices

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,240
um so the domains where trust matters

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,160
most

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,160
might be domains that you happen to

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,000
overlook um

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,080
we need to bring trust into our

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,960
communication in all of these domains up

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,440
here so

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,039
support and interaction training

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,639
technical documentation

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,680
product communication things like

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,919
product pages data sheets demos

00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:09,440
and of course editorial communication

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,440
like blogs social pr

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,000
so getting down to business let's dive

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,120
into

00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:23,600
the 10 ways so way number one

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,680
is be technically accurate always

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,960
a simple straightforward way to ensure

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,520
technical accuracy

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,000
is to interview the expert and if needed

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,280
ask them to review your work

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,199
this is especially important for

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,520
marketers and technical writers who may

00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,000
not

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,960
have the depth of knowledge um that the

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,520
developers do

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,520
for example

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,680
way number two um be precise in your

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:52,479
language

00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:55,840
and use zero hyperbole avoid things like

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:58,880
best in class only solution that

00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,560
or overusing the word innovation happens

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,520
a lot

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,000
never say it's the only uh x you'll ever

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,599
need

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,319
or or uh claiming that one technology

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,880
will solve

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,240
all of your problems um so avoid things

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:16,160
like that

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:18,560
and it's not only that these statements

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,160
are inaccurate they're also not helpful

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,960
uh they're so broad that it doesn't give

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,639
the reader

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,840
a clear picture of the value that you

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,840
can actually deliver them

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,039
way number three keep your writing tight

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,880
too much noise around what really needs

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,160
to be communicated dampens the trust

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,639
that we can build

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,400
crisp sharp focused communication

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:45,680
however gives us the clarity that we

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:47,919
spoke of earlier

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,960
way number four um a clear narrative

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,039
structure

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,479
um and this is similar to tight writing

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,240
in that it provides clarity

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,400
but it does so by taking the reader in

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,840
hand and essentially leading them down

00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,840
a clear path

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,199
way number five so an easy to navigate

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,120
informational structure

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,560
makes the journey easy and flexible for

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,240
your reader it

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,840
allows them to choose their own

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,639
adventure and consume the bits of

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,759
information that's

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,840
most relevant to them we do this

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,960
with things like descriptive headlines

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,400
breaking down

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,560
breaking the text down to smaller

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,479
paragraphs that are easy to scan

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,720
using bullet points and other formatting

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,759
to call out the important bits

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,719
and this is uh this is really

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,719
important for trust

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:42,640
and way number six is

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,680
always use uh logical rigor

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,839
and of course avoiding logical fallacies

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,800
and um i'd like to take just a minute

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,399
here

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:55,839
to uh to provide a few examples

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,839
um of logical fallacies

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:03,760
first one being over generalization

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,800
so the writer bases the argument on

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,360
insufficient evidence the writer

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,800
draws a larger conclusion than the

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,080
evidence supports

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:18,560
and so if you are claiming that cms

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:20,640
a is better than cms is a better cms

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,000
you would need to do fairly exhaustive

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,480
research and comparison

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,519
with object objective standards and

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,680
unbiased results to warrant that claim

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,040
you can however talk about a specific

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,120
set of functionality that

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,519
supports a particular use case that you

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,720
haven't seen anywhere else

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,720
that's perfectly valid

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,560
the second logical fallacy that i want

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,760
to share is

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,160
a non-sequitur or it doesn't follow

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,279
meaning so this is where the writer's

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,839
conclusion is not

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:53,040
necessarily a logical result of the

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,000
facts

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,040
for example super simple example stating

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,240
that because cms

00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:03,040
a has more functions it's a better cms

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,839
than cmsb obviously more doesn't equal

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,839
better

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,640
a third one that we have is begging the

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,360
question

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,200
so the writer presents as truth what is

00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,279
not yet proven by the argument

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,120
so before an argument on a topic can be

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,640
made or a solution offered

00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,279
the reader must be convinced that there

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,279
is a problem

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:31,360
and the last example that i'll share

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:33,360
with you is called the red herring

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,519
this is where the writer introduces a

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,440
completely irrelevant point

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,000
simply to divert the reader's attention

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:43,279
from the main issue

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,279
and you may do this unconsciously so

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,800
in reviewing your writing and reasoning

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,640
make sure that you examine

00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,720
the suppositions and the conclusions

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,200
you've made and make sure that you are

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,440
not

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,600
making diversionary or non-relevant

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,399
points to support your argument

00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,480
and a concrete example would be citing

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,480
sales figures to show that one cmsa

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:09,040
so to showing that cmsa has a higher

00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,240
has higher sales than cmsb this doesn't

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,760
prove that cms

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,880
a is a better platform than cmsb

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,880
for a given set of needs

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:26,160
way way number seven so

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,600
making so make mindful claims by

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,720
avoiding things like

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:34,240
binary claims which is you know stating

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,720
that something is good or bad um or

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,519
absolute claims meaning best worst and

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,120
things like that

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:44,720
um and certainly avoid negativity

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,399
um it's it's better to respect the

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,120
the nuance and the situations where your

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:52,320
product may not actually be the best fit

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,880
um and using fud or fear uncertainty and

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,720
doubt

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,320
um in our communication um

00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,639
and diminishing the value of the

00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:03,600
competitor doesn't help us build trust

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,639
um it's quite the opposite so focus on

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,560
what value you

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,959
deliver and not what the competition

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,800
doesn't

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,000
this doesn't mean that you shouldn't do

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,560
comparisons

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,680
um just don't do don't use it to paint

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:25,839
the competition in

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:29,279
into an especially bad light

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:33,120
so um way number eight

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:36,959
is backing up your claims with evidence

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:39,839
and so uh we have a couple of different

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,839
different types of

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,040
different types of evidence so we have

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,800
quantitative evidence which is things

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,320
like statistics

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:53,200
industry reports other research

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,920
we have case studies with quantifiable

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,639
outcomes

00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,839
and if we want to look at qualitative

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,120
evidence which is

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,120
um something that we see a lot of

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,959
that's things like expert claims

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:12,160
testimonials

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,160
anecdotal stories for examples

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:19,680
and case studies with qualitative

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,000
outcomes

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,040
and backing up a benefit claim by

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,480
explaining

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,079
how the product is actually built to

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,360
support that benefit

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,880
um our product provides xbenefit because

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,079
it's built containing

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,880
yz features that also helps back up your

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,440
claim

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:40,240
um and following on that is also

00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,240
documentation

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,199
so the other thing that we want to do

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,560
when we think about

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:51,519
um claims uh or

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,639
backing up our claims with evidence um

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,519
is looking at the

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,519
quality of the evidence and so it's

00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,480
important to ask ourselves

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,680
is each piece of evidence in the in the

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,040
content piece is it

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:08,800
valid is it relevant is it unique

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,959
um and is the evidence

00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,240
um is the evidence directly connected

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:16,240
with a cause and effect

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:18,720
relationship to the claim so um

00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,600
and we can absolutely make emotional

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,519
claims without

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,199
evidence when appropriate especially

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,800
when quoting somebody else

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:27,360
um for example uh making a statement

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,199
like

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,519
by working together we make something

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:35,040
greater than the sum of its parts

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:37,279
um that's perfectly valid

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,279
uh

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,959
way number nine um

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,839
speak from or reference an authoritative

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,040
voice

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,440
um the if the authoritative voice might

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,839
be

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,480
your internal technical expert it might

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,880
be a community-based expert

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,720
you can also reference research from a

00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:03,040
trusted source

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,040
to have that authoritative voice

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,920
so and uh last but not least way number

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,480
ten

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,600
uh recognize and acknowledge others for

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,160
their expertise

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,959
and knowledge uh contributions and

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,800
competitive

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,800
offerings this is something that open

00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,320
source communities tend to do quite well

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:31,920
actually and and it's a very important

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,920
factor in building trust

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:44,560
oh there we go

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:47,120
um so um i believe that these actions

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,880
and ways of communicate of communicating

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,440
lead to more trust

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,560
and more trust equals more connection

00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,880
and more connection

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,680
equals happier people stronger

00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,680
communities and better businesses

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,759
my hope is that trust infused

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,880
communication becomes more and more

00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,759
the norm and i also believe that

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,240
this will make the world a better place

00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,759
and

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,360
i believe that the open source

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,240
communities can play a leading role in

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,399
this

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,399
so

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,079
i think that was the next one so

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,959
sources for all the beautiful images of

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,800
course came from

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:29,279
unsplash and

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,639
that's everything so thank you so much

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,839
for your time and i'm ready

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,839
for your questions

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:41,680
thank you so much that was great um

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,680
really excellent to hear how you view

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,279
trust and how you do it for open source

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,720
for anyone who's listening if you have

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,399
any questions feel free to drop them in

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,440
the chat or put them in the questions

00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,440
bar

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,800
um i thought this was a great talk i

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,160
have some questions

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,759
if you're ready tracy i am i'm trying to

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,040
click over to the stream yard

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,560
tab but uh it's okay i'm i'm watching

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,240
that so i'll let you know you're getting

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,919
a few hearts right now

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,679
so great people okay there's no

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:11,120
questions as of yet okay um

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:13,520
okay cool thank you yeah

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,600
so one question i had was you talk about

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,199
speaking from an authoritative voice

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,839
yeah and in open source i increasingly

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,760
see

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,959
with small projects this is really easy

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,480
you know if it's a small module and

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,919
there's one person then all the docs

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,360
come from them

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,480
yeah but with larger projects i often

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,080
find that

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,000
things tend to devolve until you have

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,960
this sort of vanilla

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,559
marketing normal technical documentation

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,320
speak where there's no real person

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,120
behind it and so the authoritative voice

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,679
becomes

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,720
the voice of the project itself in a way

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,320
yeah

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:50,960
how do you do uh do you

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,480
advise people to try to put more quotes

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,120
from maintainers or something

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,760
how do you try to make it not so vanilla

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,559
but also

00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,440
more authoritative and and more relevant

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,559
to people and more

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,960
personal for larger docs yeah

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,960
um and i think part of the answer was

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,799
actually formulated in your question

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,919
um it i started begging the question

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,480
shouldn't have done that you mentioned

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,679
that in number five

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:21,039
um uh no i think that it's

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,679
um i think it is important to not just

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,799
have

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,720
um sort of a vanilla project voice of

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:31,200
course you want some consistency

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:34,720
um and you want some sort of uh

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:37,600
consistent style of voice um but

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,919
it's also really important to highlight

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,440
uh the people behind the technology

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,160
and so the contributors and the

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,640
maintainers um it's important that they

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,200
have

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,919
a voice and that they're represented um

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,200
in

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,120
all of the different types of

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,480
communication um

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:58,480
in any open source technology um and

00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,000
including documentation um and

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,919
you know it's i think it's really

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,720
helpful for people when they come

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,919
to consume any of that content if they

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,720
start to see

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,400
um some names and get to know who are

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,200
the main players

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,000
in the community that can also be quite

00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,280
motivating

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,919
for um for them to make their own

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,400
contribution as well and to participate

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,160
and

00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:27,200
so i think um i think we should

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:30,400
encourage uh highlighting

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:34,080
um the the community's voice

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,080
contributors and maintainers yeah

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,360
i like that answer thank you so much um

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,320
one question another question i have is

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:45,280
for readmes for again for small projects

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,559
um because for much larger ones there's

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,000
often someone who thinks about these

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:52,000
things but for

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,840
maintainers out there how do you

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,679
expect people to build a narrative when

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,400
really it's just description install

00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,360
usage license contribute and how do you

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
build a narrative through your

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,159
documentation do you have any

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,400
suggestions

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,159
oh that's a that's a very good question

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,679
and a very tricky one to

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:13,280
to answer um i

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:16,320
think that you can build a narrative um

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:19,600
across your documentation by

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:23,039
um tying all of the the

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,320
feature and benefit stories um together

00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,600
and weaving those throughout your

00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,280
documentation

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:29,679
and for any given piece like the readme

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,840
file

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,200
of course there's like you know the the

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,480
specific elements that people are

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,000
expecting

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,679
but there's no reason why you can't put

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,120
a little bit of context or a little bit

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,240
of backstory

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,799
at the beginning or the end of the

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:46,640
document to help

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,640
tie that narrative across the whole

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,720
all of the technical documentation

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,159
that's a good answer thank you by the

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,440
way we've lost your video i don't know

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:59,360
if that was intentional

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,840
but no um okay i just want to let you

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,520
know

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,960
again if anyone has any questions feel

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,120
free to drop them in the chat

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,440
i'm very happy to talk about this topic

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:10,640
because i i really love it so i have

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,360
some more going on um

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,559
how would you like to speak to

00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,080
policymakers with the ability to provide

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,440
funding yes

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,120
this was an interesting question i had

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,400
from the very beginning so you say

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,159
things like don't use the word

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,360
innovative too much you know avoid

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,960
buzzwords

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,520
right what happens when an open source

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,600
project

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,840
needs to talk to people who use those

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,799
languages to speak to their constituents

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:35,919
i'd say if you need funders or you need

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,919
policy makers they want those words

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,960
yeah they really do they really really

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,880
do

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,159
oh and there is no perfect answer to

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,080
this um

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,280
so just to set that up from the

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,640
beginning

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:51,600
um i

00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,679
i think there are some careful language

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:58,159
choices that you can make

00:21:53,679 --> 00:22:00,640
um where you you can get around

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,640
um not using those buzzwords or not

00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:06,480
using them so often

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:09,039
um or um

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,520
explaining them in a little bit more

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,039
depth

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,679
and um you know a little bit more of a

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,720
concrete

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:18,880
background um so if you're gonna use

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,720
a word like innovative of course it's

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,919
not you know we don't have to completely

00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:27,039
eliminate that um from our vocabulary

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,400
um but we should explain how we're

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,280
innovative how are you actually

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,520
different

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,880
um because the point about not using

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,840
buzzwords is not

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,240
is to eliminate the expectation that

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:41,440
just using these words at a high level

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,640
is going to solve um you know it's gonna

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,159
give them the understanding and the

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,039
impression that that will have what they

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,559
need

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:51,600
um and so as long as we

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:54,880
back up those specific claims

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:58,159
um or back up using those words with

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,559
um a concrete explanation um i think

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,840
that's

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,840
that might be the happy path

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,840
so that brings me to my next question

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,360
and again if you have any other

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,039
questions feel free to drop them in the

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,039
chat or the questions bar for those who

00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:14,880
miss me saying that the first two times

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:16,559
um you talk about backing it up so a lot

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,600
of trust isn't just using language but

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,720
being able to actually

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,760
embody the language that you use

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:27,360
how do you publicly in the open

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,720
manage expectations with people who

00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,640
now have the explanation that you will

00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,480
back it up where do you do you have any

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,159
tools you suggest for

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,559
for keeping a list of things that you've

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:38,960
promised or for making sure that

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,480
everyone knows like that that you're

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,679
that's more of a project management

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,400
project management question i just

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,760
wonder like

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,840
on the back end how do you make sure

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,400
that you always fulfill everything that

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:51,360
you say in your docs

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,080
um actually we have a very specific tool

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,279
for this

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,480
and we call it the value map um i don't

00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,880
know that anybody else

00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,840
um uses something like this but

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,240
essentially

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:06,960
it's um a tool where we collect

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,480
an inventory of every single feature and

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,520
benefit

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,480
that a particular piece of software has

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,440
and we make sure that we that the

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,400
inventory is

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,360
complete and we make sure that it's in

00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,360
the language

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,960
um following the principles that we

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,159
believe in and what we've just

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:29,039
discussed and all of

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,480
the um marketing communications or

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,919
technical communications

00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,799
that are built they're built upon that

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,840
value map

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:41,279
so it comes from like this concrete

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:44,000
structure um so

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,039
that's essentially how we really um

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,320
approach that

00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:49,440
issue that's really fascinating i would

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,679
love to see one of those

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,480
in action um what sort of people's open

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,159
strategy partner

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,240
normally work with what sort of

00:24:54,159 --> 00:25:00,080
organizations what size

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:02,799
um size ranges um we work with

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,400
um small and medium-sized technical

00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:07,840
agencies but we also work

00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:11,120
with um large associations

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:14,159
and companies we operate

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,039
almost exclusively in in the open source

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,679
space

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,240
and we have um so for example we work

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,520
with

00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:24,240
a type of three the association as well

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:26,960
as the commercial arm the gmbh

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,760
and an agency within uh within that

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,320
community

00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,039
we also are quite active in the uh

00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,559
drupal

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:37,200
community um and uh

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,240
and yeah essentially we love uh

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,400
technology and

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,840
especially open source is our home base

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,000
so you work with with large communities

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:49,360
i mean drupal's huge and that's great

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,880
um yeah how do you get values from large

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,360
communities you use questionnaires you

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,400
use surveys what do you do

00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:59,360
um that that is a

00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,200
fascinating question and um the drupal

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,080
community is actually a really great

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,360
um example where they've gone through um

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,840
several

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,799
iterations and effort around building

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,679
their

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,240
values and something that we do actually

00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,120
with our

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,960
clients at a smaller level is help them

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,720
identify their values so that they can

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,480
bring out the right character and tone

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:24,240
in their communication

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:27,520
um and there's several different

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:30,080
schools of thought um about how to build

00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,039
build values so there's um there's an

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,520
inclusive approach

00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,960
where you might survey the community

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,919
find out their feedback

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,640
collect that aggregate it sort it out

00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,159
and then

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,919
articulate them based on that and

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:44,559
there's another school

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,360
of thought which is that the leadership

00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:49,279
alone

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:52,400
um should try to develop these um

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:55,600
these values and um

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,159
the drupal community actually did a

00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,880
hybrid

00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,679
of these two solutions so it was

00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,080
essentially the

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,080
the leadership team in the association

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,000
with an external consultant

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,520
that worked on their latest version of

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,840
their values um

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,840
which are very they're the best

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:15,279
articulated values i've seen so i'd

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:17,279
encourage people to check them out um

00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,720
and the way that they went about doing

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,279
this in a hybrid way

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,080
is that they uh i believe they did

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,640
interview

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,200
some key people within the community and

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:27,919
got their

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:30,320
input um and then i believe they went

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,000
away on an executive retreat and

00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,440
you know worked through them and

00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,120
articulated them

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:39,279
from there which is a great approach

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,200
yeah that sounds excellent um and i

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,640
think given the 10 steps that you have

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,960
that would also really really help

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,760
starting with the value chain then going

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,520
forward and saying does this

00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,080
documentation match these things are we

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,120
being

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,720
honest forthright using the right words

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,799
putting our money where a mouse is this

00:27:52,720 --> 00:28:03,840
is this is great stuff thank you so much

00:27:54,799 --> 00:28:03,840
i really appreciate it

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,600
