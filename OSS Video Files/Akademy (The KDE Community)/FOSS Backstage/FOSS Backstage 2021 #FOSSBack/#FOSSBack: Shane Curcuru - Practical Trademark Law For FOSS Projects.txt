Title: #FOSSBack: Shane Curcuru - Practical Trademark Law For FOSS Projects
Publication date: 2021-02-24
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Are you trying to build the brand of your community-led project? Is your community struggling to keep vendor marketing teams out of your project's governance? Do you need a lawyer before you can "trademark" something, or can you do it yourself? (Tip: you can do it yourself!)

This AMA is here to help answer basic trademark law questions in practical, everyday terms for FOSS projects and the companies that contribute to them. Legal advice can only come from your own lawyer - but most community questions have practical answers that can get you started without a lawyer. Trademarks are all about the public's association of a brand with a product - and most of that happens in the real world, not a lawyer's office.

Bring your simple community questions about how trademarks work, and we'll try to get you some practical advice on what to do. Similarly, corporate questions are welcome - for how you can effectively partner with a Foundation or community-led project without stepping on toes.

Trademark education for engineers and community members.
