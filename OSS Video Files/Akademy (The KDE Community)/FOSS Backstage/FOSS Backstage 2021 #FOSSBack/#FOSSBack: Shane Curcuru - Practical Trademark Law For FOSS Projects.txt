Title: #FOSSBack: Shane Curcuru - Practical Trademark Law For FOSS Projects
Publication date: 2021-02-24
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Are you trying to build the brand of your community-led project? Is your community struggling to keep vendor marketing teams out of your project's governance? Do you need a lawyer before you can "trademark" something, or can you do it yourself? (Tip: you can do it yourself!)

This AMA is here to help answer basic trademark law questions in practical, everyday terms for FOSS projects and the companies that contribute to them. Legal advice can only come from your own lawyer - but most community questions have practical answers that can get you started without a lawyer. Trademarks are all about the public's association of a brand with a product - and most of that happens in the real world, not a lawyer's office.

Bring your simple community questions about how trademarks work, and we'll try to get you some practical advice on what to do. Similarly, corporate questions are welcome - for how you can effectively partner with a Foundation or community-led project without stepping on toes.

Trademark education for engineers and community members.

	00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:08,000
today

00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,679
i'll just take 10 seconds to thank um

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,599
all of our wonderful hosts and the

00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,840
organization that's running all of this

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,200
um foss backstage is such an amazingly

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,560
well-run conference not only not of

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,720
course the people are great but

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,160
but having everything done the streaming

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,560
situation the chats

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,160
it's super awesome to be here uh to be

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,680
here today with all of you

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,359
so today now we're gonna talk about um

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,199
putting our mouse on the right right

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,840
slide practical trademark

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,920
law for your project uh since most of us

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,280
here are either leaders or participants

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,360
in open source projects

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,719
this is really about how we on the

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,160
project side not as much

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:47,120
on the corporate side um think about our

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,640
our trademarks and our brands and how

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,520
what we can do about it some practical

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,960
advice

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,719
so typically we we usually

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,280
would have a talk about trademark law

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,280
topics and what the law says

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,800
but i'm going to turn around if you

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,480
notice the bullet points here

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,239
are a number of practical advice is

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,799
actually more important

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,080
so if you're in the corporate world or

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,600
maybe if you're part of a linux

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,920
foundation major project

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,600
the trade the law is is important and

00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,840
you need to do all sorts of things about

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,200
it

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,520
but for most of us we don't have those

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,600
resources and we have

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,080
also different skills and different

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,840
abilities so really the practical side

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,040
is what i think is most important for us

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,080
and there are some things that

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,119
you probably haven't thought about

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,320
so this is also an ask me anything so

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,960
i'm going to have time for questions

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,280
later

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,320
but i really want to go through some big

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,240
picture

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,159
things that we as project leaders or

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,200
participants should think about

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,720
in terms of better managing and

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,560
promoting our own trademarks and

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,720
especially defending them from

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,240
you know the little vc uh startup

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,799
commercial companies that come along and

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,119
try and

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,320
seal your reputation so these are the

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,240
practical bits

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,159
once i get through these uh i'll start

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,079
opening up for questions i have

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,759
individual sections on different parts

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,360
of trademark law in terms of how it

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,640
actually applies

00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,000
to open source projects which is

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,560
different than commercial projects in

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,679
many places

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,239
in some cases but i want to go to the

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,360
there's way too much content for that um

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,040
so i want to go into the places that

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,160
people here are interested in we can go

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,000
into specific sections

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,200
to answer questions or take general

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,440
questions

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,959
so here's some practical advice

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,840
practical trademark advice for your

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,400
project

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,520
the first one is use consistent

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,520
trademarks

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,440
so many of us know what our software

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,360
does and we're so excited about it

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,120
and we we call it different names we

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,959
might use the old logo

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,120
the first thing and the simplest thing

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,920
to do to help protect your marks

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,400
is use them consistently use the name of

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,040
your

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,120
product the thing that people download

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,040
in a consistent way capitalize it

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,120
using a special font whatever your your

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,360
particular brand is

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,879
always use it as an adjective so the

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,239
best way to say it is

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,599
download apache couchdb software here

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,000
because from the trademark law

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:05,040
perspective trademarks

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,360
are marking a product with a name with a

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,760
symbol that people recognize

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,560
so a lot of us are pretty sloppy with

00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,800
that

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,920
which is fine in normal use but doing

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,720
these kind of things including the

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,000
little tm

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,879
and the r symbol if you have a

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,360
registration um those ways

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,159
are part of at least in in many

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,879
countries in first to use countries

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,599
showing displaying your trademarks with

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,040
um

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,640
the appropriate symbols and doing them

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,000
the way that the law intends which is a

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,480
little bit clunky sometimes but

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,440
okay um is a way to build up common law

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,680
rights

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,120
uh so even if you haven't registered or

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,799
you haven't done anything else

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,799
in many countries you will still have

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,840
rights to your marks as long as

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,080
someone looking at them could recognize

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,720
them

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,840
another easy thing here is essentially

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,640
this is treat your trademarks with

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,280
respect

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,560
so we have licenses and we have codes of

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,200
conduct that tell us

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,080
and tell participants how they can use

00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,680
our software

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,159
how they can participate in our

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,920
communities well do you have a trademark

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,599
use policy

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,200
it's not that hard there's there's one

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,360
online that you can simply copy that's

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,040
written for open source projects but

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,080
treating your trademarks

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,200
as an important part of your project and

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,120
your community

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,359
is the first step show everybody else

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,840
that you treat take it seriously

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,759
and that helps other people see that as

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,880
an important asset to your project and

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,880
something they should respect

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,320
here's the this is the hardest question

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,800
really at the root of it for

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,800
open source projects is how strong is

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,919
your organization's reputation

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,600
in the larger world so most trademark

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,120
issues are really solved either through

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,759
private negotiation

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,280
or through public shaming there's a lot

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,000
of private negotiation that goes on that

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,479
you never see

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,600
unless you're in that organization we've

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,880
all seen a few

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,880
places where public shaming has been

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,960
used

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,639
and sure you know there have been a

00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,919
handful of trademark cases in open

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,479
source but

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,600
really most of the work is done by

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,000
making the right

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,440
business case to some potential

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,759
infringer

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,360
uh who's infringing on your marks and

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,080
the way you do that is by showing that

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,600
your space

00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,520
in the open source ecosystem in the

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,199
technology ecosystem

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,960
is important and that it's your

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,400
trademark and they need to stop

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,479
infringing on it so

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,440
this is the really two parts to this one

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,360
is

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,639
how well-known is your organization as

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,560
your reputation overall

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,320
just either your project or the whole

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,880
you know umbrella organization you're

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,720
with

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,919
how well known is it in corporate

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,320
circles right will

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,919
corporations and people leading large

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,840
projects who might be

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,600
taking your code and then reselling it

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,680
and using your name

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,199
how will they know you or not the other

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,600
side of the question is

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,639
how well do key developers in your

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,240
technology area

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,240
know your project because a huge way to

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,919
make sure that large companies respect

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,680
your trademarks

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,759
is if there are contributors to your

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,720
project get to also work at those

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,600
companies

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,520
or work at partner companies get them to

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,880
do internal advocacy

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,560
um the point is that most

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,560
the most ways we successfully defend

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,560
open source trademarks from misuse

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,400
are through these social and business

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,120
case aspects it's not not really about

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,960
the law

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,520
from our perspective and this i i admit

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,160
this is

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,240
a difficult thing for smaller projects

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,039
because they don't have the reputation

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,800
so at the apache software foundation i

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,479
created the position of vp

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,400
vice president brand management and

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,080
wrote our trademark policy

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,319
and after i worked with it for a while i

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,440
realized i was never concerned about

00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,520
going to court

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,280
because apache and a few other

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,639
organizations have this the breadth to

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,400
simply say

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,479
if we have to we can publicly shame

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,400
someone we can remove them

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,840
from our contributors to a project that

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,759
someone if if

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,199
they are egregiously infringing our

00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,840
trademark let me be clear

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,240
this is only a final step we can remove

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,639
them

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,479
from participating in a project that for

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,160
me is far more powerful

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,599
at apache at this project with that

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,560
skill than any

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,360
lawsuit and it's also from our

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,919
perspective is

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,440
open source group much more practical to

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,800
do because it doesn't require the

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:22,160
legal expertise and the money

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,199
so of course um a main issue we

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,759
we think about when we think about

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,319
trademarks is uh what happens when

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,080
somebody

00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,479
misuses our mark how do we go about

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,520
fixing it they actually the first

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,120
question is

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,800
how are you going to discover those

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,039
things so

00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,240
once some company and the typical case

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,560
here that i've seen

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,240
dozens of times is that either a big

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,280
company sometimes are usually smaller

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,199
companies

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,879
ones that are looking to grow quickly

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,319
will either purposefully

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,560
or unknowingly co-opt

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,919
an open source project's reputation

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,240
their trademarks their brand

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,520
whatever in their own products and then

00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,199
trying to sell them effectively

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,520
competing with you by

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,280
using your software which is okay and

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,479
also effectively using your

00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,680
trademarks which is not okay the trick

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,840
is

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,120
correcting these things both in the

00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,319
overall perspective

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,400
and in the perspective from the

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,039
infringer becomes

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,039
geometrically or exponentially harder

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,319
the longer a potential infringement goes

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,599
on

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:26,000
so is your community around your project

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,280
are they active would they notice if

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,680
some new company

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,479
were trying to capitalize on your brand

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,959
and particularly

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,839
in particular would they know who to

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:35,919
report it to

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,279
and if they do report it that you know

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,479
this new vc company that

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:40,880
never even talking about them and all of

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,719
a sudden they're now running the cloud

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:47,120
service that uses your software

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:49,040
and uses your name to drive their sales

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,360
we might have heard that recently in the

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,360
news

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,000
how would you find out about that and

00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,600
when you do with the community which is

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,720
what we really can rely on

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,959
let the right people in your

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,360
organization know so you can say okay

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,320
yes this is a problem yes we need to

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,279
address it

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,160
and we need to go uh you know get an

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,440
officer from our

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,839
organization to start talking with the

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,200
company right uh do you have the

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,440
processes around

00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,720
do you have a trademark policy that's

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,080
back a couple slides

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,000
do you have the process to how to

00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,040
address infringements so

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,880
at the asf we have a clear process we

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,399
have a volunteer right vp of brand

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,080
management who is responsible for this

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,760
and some volunteers that help them

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,680
we have an expert council and retainer

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,760
who we really don't use very often for

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,760
this

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,480
but even in that case it's still an

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,480
issue for all of apache's 200 projects

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,320
to be effective at collecting these

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:45,040
things and bringing them up

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,240
so an important structural thing is to

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,519
think about

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,440
how was your com how would your

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,320
organization how would your project

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,880
whatever you have address misuses of

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,279
your

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,279
brands

00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,920
um so one of the things we always people

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,600
always ask about are trademark

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,519
registrations are they important can i

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,200
just go trademark something

00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,880
uh the lawyers are now twitching because

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,600
i said trademark is a verb

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,680
it's not a verb registrations are like

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,720
an insurance policy

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,640
the issue is that it takes a long time

00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,959
to get your policy actually written

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,320
so you you have a trademark and you can

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,640
go apply

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,920
to various national registries and of

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,680
course it's different in every country

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,920
or across the eu

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:32,000
um but it takes the uspto

00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,680
which does trademarks uh at least six

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,680
months if not longer to even sort of

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,040
get around to your application and if

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,000
there are questions then

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,640
much longer so you you can't you can't

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,160
i've seen

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,560
a number of projects where oh my

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,839
goodness somebody's misusing our brand

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,760
and it's hard to deal with oh let's go

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,839
make it a registry registration well

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:53,040
it's kind of too late at that point

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,480
um the trick here is

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,720
if you're a commercial company you could

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,640
just go register in a bunch of countries

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,240
as open source projects we don't have

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,079
those resources

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,760
so the trick will be to figure out which

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,760
countries are really important for your

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,360
contributor base i.e which countries do

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,720
you want to make sure that you can

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,000
really protect your trademark

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,440
for people who are going to come to

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,560
contribute to your project because

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,160
that's really the most important thing

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,760
for open source projects is bringing in

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,640
new contributors

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,640
um the good thing about registrations is

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,600
once you have a registration granted

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,399
that is actually

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,279
issued by some country's authority it's

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,000
very hard

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,279
to take it away from you very very hard

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,040
so

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,320
in the small scale that gives you a

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,519
really strong defense

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:42,240
in the countries you get registered in

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,360
that unfortunately does not necessarily

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,600
legally

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,200
protect you in other countries there

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,680
certainly are some legal aspects to it

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,880
but

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,800
those really aren't very important what

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,360
really is important is that you can

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:57,519
continue to use your brand in your key

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:59,519
countries and then that your reputation

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,279
can uh ensure that people still come

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,839
find you instead of somebody else

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,639
although again usually business is uh

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,920
another

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,680
good thing about registrations that's

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,519
that's you don't think about is

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,680
um businesses usually have lawyers who

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,600
who will check registered marks

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,120
before naming products so that they'll

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,079
avoid you to start with right it's a

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,200
it's a sort of a

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:21,600
a big moat in a number of ways

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:25,200
that prevent people from starting to

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:28,399
misuse your brand or your trademarks

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,399
um and

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,279
so don't go to court uh as the the

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,160
lesson but so everybody out there

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,440
raise your hand if you're yeah pretend

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,560
pretend we're all in a room together

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,000
again that'd be awesome

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,240
raise your hand if your organization

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,720
your open source project has a trademark

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,120
lawyer

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,480
on retainer right so you actually could

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,519
call them and they would just

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,320
talk to you right it might take a little

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,560
while but okay now keep your hand raised

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,279
if you have the budget to pay

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,160
that lawyer for a week's worth of work

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,399
do you have you actually

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,760
got that cash and you have it budgeted

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,000
for legal work

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,279
okay now keep your hand up you can put

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,079
your hand down if you don't have that

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:08,720
keep your hand up if you also have the

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:12,160
leadership capacity in your organization

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,160
uh to manage a lawsuit

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,720
right to work with that lawyer to gather

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,399
evidence from your website from

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,920
whatever and whoever's infringing on you

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,800
that you want to sue gather from their

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,800
website

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,000
uh to address legal questions right the

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,920
lawyer's gonna say

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,519
can we claim this or not can you show us

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,000
proof

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,120
for most of us if if you think you have

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,200
to go to court

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,320
um most open source organizations

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,959
non-profits

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,000
you've already lost because it's far too

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:42,160
expensive

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,480
um and far too much of a drain on your

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,240
organizational leadership to be

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,240
effective at a trademark

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,519
lawsuit um so i guess that the point is

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,920
i really hope it never comes to this

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,959
point um the good question is

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:59,600
it usually doesn't um if you

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,320
if you do the practical steps here uh in

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,199
this talk

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,680
then it takes certainly takes time and

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,040
there are

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,800
a number of cases where we've had

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,680
private negotiations going on for quite

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,279
a while with

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,199
a commercial company that's infringing

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,240
on one of our marks um

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:16,000
but they have all worked out in in

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,240
admittedly a small case there right this

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:23,199
is not covering everybody in open source

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:26,240
um but that does work because

00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:28,560
for any any of us who have a reasonable

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,000
uh reputation a reasonable scope of the

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,959
technologies that our project

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,040
participates in uh if we find the right

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:38,000
people in some infringing company

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,720
to show sure you're making money off of

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,839
this

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,079
um you know co-opting some open source

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,959
project's name right to go sell

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,519
something

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:50,079
uh but the bigger technical question is

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,680
that's great for your quarterly sales

00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,600
but how's the rest of the open source

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,040
community seeing you are other

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,000
foundations going to want to accept your

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,920
projects

00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,199
are you going to draw in new open source

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,120
talent well

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,040
if you're a company that's that's shown

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,600
to be abusing of other open source

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,800
either

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,880
licenses or trademarks um

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,800
open source talent is a huge huge

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,920
question and people pay attention to

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,240
that

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:15,360
obviously everybody coming to fosback's

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,600
age probably already

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,279
knows that intuitively but that's an

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,839
important part

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,120
in large companies thinking about their

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,639
internal operations

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,399
you just need to find the right person

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,040
inside the company who can

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,639
tie together that the technology aspect

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,800
the talent aspect

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,920
and then the public image aspect of sure

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,480
you might be making money

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,800
from some sales stream but you're also

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,480
attracting a lot of negative publicity

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,399
if your open if an open source project

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,120
is complaining publicly

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,320
um so that's a long one invite way to

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,839
say

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,000
for all the times we sort of start

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,120
talking about tiny details about

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,959
trademark law

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,959
and you know should we sue after we send

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,120
a cease and desist all that

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,480
you don't want to go to court uh you

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,120
know unless

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,079
maybe your well-funded linux foundation

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,560
project

00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,839
that's not a place that an open source

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,519
non-profit

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,959
community-led group wants to be because

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,639
you know large corporations and large

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:19,120
budgets are what will overwhelm them

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,120
so those are practical

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,880
things that we can do many of which

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,399
don't involve a lawyer right you

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,839
probably want to get a lawyer to

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,680
actually file your registration to make

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,639
the process simpler but you don't need

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:32,639
one you actually can

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,639
file yourself in many countries

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,800
thinking about how your organization

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,680
uses your own marks right show that you

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,759
respect them and

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,680
ask other people with a policy to

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,480
respect your trademarks respect your

00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,480
brand

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,160
you're free to take our code but don't

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,600
capitalize on our

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,920
social and technical capital um

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,839
making sure your organization has a way

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,560
to address these things and to detect

00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,199
these things

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,639
right having an intake form just like a

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,800
bug report

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,480
for hey somebody's missed using our

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,480
project brand somewhere

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,160
those are all things that a lot of

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,240
projects haven't really thought about

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,160
but those are practical things we can do

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,079
with limited budget without having to do

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,640
lawyer use lawyers

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,120
that will make a difference later on

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,919
when

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:22,160
an issue comes up because the the other

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,760
two truisms are

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,679
once you find out about something it's

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,720
usually kind of late and it's much

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,799
harder to

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,480
it's much harder to fix something if you

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,160
find out about it later

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,760
and the other one is a lot of times we

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,880
we don't find out about things

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,080
um until it's way way too late but i

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,200
want to take a break from

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,640
the big practical aspects and here is a

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,640
list i actually don't have the right

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,679
chat but here's a list of the other

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,320
topics

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,200
that i have that are about trademark law

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,240
in terms of

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,760
defining legally more specifically what

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,039
trademarks are

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,799
uh top tips tips on displaying your own

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,480
marks being consistent all those things

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,720
there there are a few simple things that

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,440
you can do uh just with your existing

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,880
website

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,960
and you're considering existing

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,600
marketing materials that will get you a

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,720
good way

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,440
forward um others using your marks how

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,679
to detect

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,440
and what to do if somebody's infringing

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,960
we have a topic on registrations and

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,720
what they actually mean

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,559
a little bit right that's a that's a

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,000
huge topic and it's of course

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,840
worldwide and uh little blurbs on

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,360
misunderstood trademark topics there are

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,880
a couple of questions that come up all

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,120
the time where people are like

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,160
i'm like no that that's has nothing to

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,400
do with trademarks

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,679
um but here's a question where i'd like

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,799
to say

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:41,840
where would we like to go next so if my

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,280
moderator back there um has has either a

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,840
specific question

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,039
or has one of these topics that people

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,640
have asked about

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,480
um i can just go through i have three or

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,160
four slides for each of the topics

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,320
that you know there's a question on

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,160
registrations i'll just go through the

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:58,160
registration section and hopefully

00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,840
they'll answer the question

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,840
thank you so much jane that's great uh

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,200
very clear high level introduction to

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,559
the topic

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,600
and uh yeah i don't see questions yet in

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,520
the chat

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,039
i'll keep monitoring that but as this is

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,520
a topic close to my heart

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,200
i haven't okay good started i'm going to

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,919
kick off with um

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,640
with elastic because uh you know it's

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,960
been a big

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,559
trending topic and i was also tweeting

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,440
about it in relation to this talk

00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,280
yesterday

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,559
so that my question specifically is

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,600
about um

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,760
shay bannon and elastic's uh opinion on

00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,880
trademark enforceability in their case

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,120
um because

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,720
basically what elastic have said in the

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,760
last two weeks is that

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,200
they've had to abandon an open source uh

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,400
compatible license according to the open

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,160
source definition

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,840
because their trademarks were not

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,240
enforceable against

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,000
uh amazon at least not yet and they

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,640
didn't go into detail with that

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,480
but um that that's against conventional

00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,919
wisdom as far as i'm aware so i wondered

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,760
what your view was on this on this

00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,120
debate okay i will i don't

00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,799
i don't know that there is a shared

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,480
conventional wisdom at least

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:08,000
among us who aren't counsel um

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:11,280
so i think the the biggest

00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,640
question is um trademarks are about

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,360
perception

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,880
so literally trademarks the the the

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,840
purpose of trademarks is to protect

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,840
consumers

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,880
in in a re a lot of ways they're not

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,880
really protect us

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,880
as producers it's to make sure that

00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,360
consumers when they're going to buy

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:29,360
a ford car that they expect to be

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,159
reliable or a coca-cola that they expect

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,679
to be

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,280
sharp that when they buy a bottle like

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,559
that they'll get that flavor

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:40,400
and not the sweet flavor of pepsi um

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,039
correspondingly a lot of trademark

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,840
issues in in non-famous brands

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,880
and certainly in our area aren't done

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,039
aren't solved

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,200
by going to court they're solved by

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:54,480
bringing up the business pressure

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,360
um or by being serious enough about

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,600
appearing to

00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,880
get ready to sue somebody that the other

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,559
person says you know it's not worth my

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,799
it's not worth my time and my expense to

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,200
defend from that so one thing i have not

00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,600
looked

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,480
in detail about the elasticsearch thing

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,200
um

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,280
but i would certainly question what was

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,120
elasticsearch doing for the first

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,400
how many years was it certainly three

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:22,000
plus years where amazon was effectively

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:24,159
using elasticsearch on an amazon product

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,840
right what was elasticsearch happy that

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,360
they were getting extra

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:28,720
sales referrals were they happy that

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,919
they got an amazon discount was there

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,360
some actual agreement or did they just

00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,480
let it happen

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,320
because the trick is if you let it

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,360
happen that long then of course the

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,039
other company's going to say we have

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,400
tons of sunk costs

00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,400
they're going to fight back until they

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,280
see a serious

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,039
lawsuit about it from my perspective

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,880
elasticsearch should have

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:48,400
you know done something about it within

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,440
the first year right away and i think

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,240
that would have made a big difference

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,679
right

00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:56,720
whether or not um legally

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,280
amazon they almost amazon certainly

00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,480
almost

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,400
would have been in the wrong if it had

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,159
been addressed early but more to the

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,960
point a business decision on amazon's

00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,799
part is

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,240
this company's going to make a stink

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,480
then amazon would have

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,600
said early on great we'll go make our

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,200
own thing

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,960
we'll we'll call it our own thing that

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,280
uses all your software

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,720
right so they would have forked the code

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,039
and not the name

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,760
and of course elastic would still have

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,679
ended up complaining about this

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,200
right i mean that's a lot of the big

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,720
point of people who are

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,640
having a hard time with with cloud

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,440
providers is there whether or not you're

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,720
using the name

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,799
they still want to prevent you from

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,159
actually using the software so that's

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,559
actually a separate question it would

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,559
help

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:41,760
anyways um but in terms of the

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:43,440
like the legal aspects of the uh

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,960
trademark appropriateness of either

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,240
amazon or elastic

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:49,840
there's a simple answer for that

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,520
question it depends

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,200
uh you know so if you if you go to a

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,480
trademark lawyer that's that's a common

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,679
joke is

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,360
great okay what what was actually on

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,720
amazon's website three years ago

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,200
how was it specific how was

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,400
elasticsearch specifically tied

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,200
to a product offered in commerce yes or

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,960
no

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,799
did elasticsearch have registrations at

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,039
the time right

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,720
um had elasticsearch been treating their

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:17,760
mark and had they been

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,320
actually going out and issuing c d

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,240
letters

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,600
or at least complaining to other

00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,000
companies had they been attempting to

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,000
defend

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,480
it right all those things would factors

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,840
would end up going into any lawsuit and

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:32,400
they're all complicated uh does that

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,039
it does thank you thank you my next

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,440
question

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,240
which is um yeah a bit more practical

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,280
then and

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,279
perhaps uh uh more applicable about the

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,600
use of the symbols so you referred to

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,200
these symbols earlier in your talk with

00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,840
them i wonder

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,760
uh when is a good time to start using uh

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,919
the tm symbol for example

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,960
because you might only be registering a

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,960
trademark in

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,400
one region for your open source project

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,120
because it's expensive and slow as you

00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,640
mentioned

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,960
or you might not have started using the

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,240
symbols at all because you might not

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,840
for example have joined the sflc or you

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,760
might not have a legal entity

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,159
established is there a limit on when you

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,880
can start using tm and would you advise

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,600
to use it

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,159
early or later so let's be clear i am

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,919
not

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,600
your lawyer i'm not anybody's lawyer

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,520
here um

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,120
i only play a lawyer on the trade i only

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,679
play a trademark lawyer on the internet

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,039
so

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,480
um if you have start using the tm as

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,360
soon as you have enough of a web

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,240
presence

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,799
to have a consistent name for a specific

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,240
product

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:36,480
you are offering you can slap tm on

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,760
anything you want there's no real legal

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,840
penalty

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,200
it won't have won't have much meaning

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,720
until you are being consistent

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,520
right saying apache couchdb tm

00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,960
software download that here right

00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,279
because you're using couchdb

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,400
as a as a symbol that means this is the

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:56,159
product we're offering

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:59,440
to people right um but you can do that

00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:02,320
as soon as you want and obviously in

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,039
in most first to use countries once you

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,520
start doing that

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,559
you can then use that as an intent to

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:09,679
use application or

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:11,679
you can you can just start showing

00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,919
in common law that you have some rights

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,520
to it um first to file countries

00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,400
probably won't really care

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,000
but it's still worth doing because in a

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,440
practical sense

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,520
that shows people looking at your

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,360
website oh they have a real product

00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,279
right they're thinking about

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,880
this right company even companies will

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,480
say oh if they're claiming it as a

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,360
trademark we probably should be careful

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,799
about it

00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,039
right whether or not they make a

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:37,360
business business decision to try and

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:39,360
infringe later is separate but they will

00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:43,360
probably not

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:46,240
um and so one thing i

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,600
i thought of earlier is um in terms of

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,000
registrations

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,520
one value again trademarks are a lot

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,919
about perception

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,440
so one value of getting an issued

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,480
registration

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,120
in uh most countries i think almost

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,679
every country

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,880
allows this is once you have that

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,720
registration

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,159
issued right they have to formally give

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:10,559
you the number and all that stuff

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:12,080
you can then stick the r on your website

00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,240
because it is registered and now it

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,279
might just be registered in australia

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,679
right but it's still registered so the

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:22,080
perception there is when when you

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,880
say hey you can't use our our logo like

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,480
that right you're

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,080
using it with somebody else's product

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,520
you can say hey this is our registered

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,559
trademark

00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:34,240
right when another company or

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:36,080
an abuser gets that email as soon

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,000
most managers would forward it up to

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,559
legal and as soon as legal sees there's

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,520
a little r in it they'll say yeah don't

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,279
do that

00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,520
right because the risk to them is so

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:47,039
much bigger uh than

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,720
not having registration a registration

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,400
is sort of like a legal proof

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,240
that you can pass around saying yes you

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,640
have some rights in this now

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,080
how strong those rights are in you know

00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,919
russia or india if you're only

00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,400
registered in australia

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,480
i don't really know but they will

00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,520
probably make a business decision

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,840
to not infringe

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,799
so getting one registration actually is

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,120
a big win

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:13,200
in terms of you can then use the r i

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,400
don't use the r beforehand because

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,279
you know people actually could complain

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,960
about that i mean you wouldn't get in

00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:19,039
trouble but if there were

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,159
a future lawsuit about it they would use

00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:23,840
that as a

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,799
complaint thank you this one comes from

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,840
the audience it

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:29,520
speaks to elastic and mongodb it's going

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,080
to ask you to speculate

00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,640
i warn you in advance the question is

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,720
what's

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,240
what's your opinion on whether the

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:39,600
strategy of these companies

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,960
was right from the first to change their

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:44,080
licenses later on

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:46,480
uh and presumably blame trademarks

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,080
as a result i i dare say you don't have

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,679
uh consulting relationships with those

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,480
firms and if you did it would be

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,840
confidential anyway but uh play it again

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,520
no i do not

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,279
have a relationship with either firm i

00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:01,840
do not have stock in either firm either

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:02,480
um uh well from a community perspective

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,520
they both

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,240
screwed up period right when you when

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,600
you

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:11,039
community reputation is all about um

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,240
portraying who you are and then staying

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,120
true to that and they clearly were

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,720
trying to be

00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,919
hey we're we're running this great thing

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,880
but we also want to be open source and

00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,399
have community

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,960
oh sorry we're actually changing our

00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,799
license no uh

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,720
that's just a bad decision and in terms

00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,960
of the developer

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,559
uh feedback and the feedback from other

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,320
open source organizations

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:32,159
no we're not going to trust them and

00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:34,720
that's going to certainly affect

00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,200
who contributes um who's interested in

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,279
you know

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,559
in the next couple years of hey i want

00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,840
to build my next search technology

00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:41,600
should i

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,880
add this or should i add lucine or

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,480
whatever

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,080
developers are going to choose somebody

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:52,159
else partly because of that mistrust

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:55,200
in terms of blaming it on trademarks

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:58,000
that's kind of a bold

00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,080
answer i think i suppose it might be

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,919
smart in a way because a lot of

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,480
people are gonna be kind of confused

00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:07,360
trying to actually analyze

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,799
what that means um but it's not a not a

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,480
very good excuse

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,600
um in any case right if they were really

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,240
thinking about that then they should

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,720
have had

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,159
both better legal and better you know

00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,360
brand planning

00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:22,240
expertise ahead of time um so

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,799
no in terms of business decision i'm not

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,880
gonna

00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,240
speculate on that but um i'm certainly

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,200
not going to be

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,720
working with them from my perspective so

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,600
yeah

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,480
thanks and uh i just want to sneak one

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,520
additional question

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,399
here um you mentioned public image that

00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,000
aspect

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:42,159
for example how to communicate the

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,279
decision to enforce trademarks in an

00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,200
open source project

00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:48,000
i wonder if any really good examples

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:51,520
come to mind that we might learn from

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,760
uh i'm sure there are a couple

00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,720
um i guess two things is one is if

00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,360
anybody follows

00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:00,000
you know legal people on twitter every

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:02,240
now and then they post a really funny

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,520
cease and desist letter right or really

00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,840
interestingly written

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,559
decision from a judge right that says

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,320
you know

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,760
fulfills the legal requirement of stop

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,320
doing this or else

00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,760
but is done in a humorous and thoughtful

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,000
way

00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,679
those are are great both because you

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,360
know then if it gets public it can

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,799
go viral but also because the person

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,919
reading it right the people reading

00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,880
these things when you're complaining

00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,919
about them

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:28,960
they're people too and they also

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:34,159
think about the business part of it

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,159
um and something else i completely

00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:40,559
forgot um

00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:43,120
i guess the only other point is uh

00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,000
when you're addressing uh an

00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,440
infringement you're trying to get

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,320
somebody else to change their behavior

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,679
around your

00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:52,480
brand your trademarks always start

00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,520
in private right give them a chance to

00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,360
save face

00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,640
that that solved a ton of things

00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,480
certainly apache and i imagine in

00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,399
smaller cases smaller companies too

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,840
you say no really this is our trademark

00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:04,880
here's how we'd like you to use it or

00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,919
we would like you to not use it a lot of

00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,440
companies will

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,600
respect that after it takes them a

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,159
little while right but they will respect

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,440
it

00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,559
another key point is have an officer in

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,960
your organization

00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,000
send the letter right some random

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,760
developer sending a letter

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,279
if it goes to some manager in the

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,000
company you know whoever the company

00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,480
goes to

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,679
they're gonna be like who is this person

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,679
i don't really care

00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:28,960
if you sign it as vice president brand

00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,320
management the apache software

00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,200
foundation with the big signature and

00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,960
your logo

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,399
then they're like oh this is somebody

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,000
serious right

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,840
little things like that actually do make

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
a difference in terms of

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,360
especially how quickly they'll respond

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,039
and to a degree whether or not they will

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,440
respond right i mean

00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,799
technically some random person doesn't

00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,960
have rights to

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,640
do this for apache or for your company

00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,640
or your organization

00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,919
um but you know at apache we have an

00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,760
officer for this

00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,279
and they're the ones who send these

00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,159
notices that actually makes a difference

00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:01,120
right

00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,640
we try not we try to have our hats of of

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,399
what we're representing

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,399
we don't have titles we're not a

00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:08,159
hierarchy but

00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:11,679
certainly big companies do have

00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,679
hierarchies and they notice them

00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:29,840
that's great thank you so shane thank

00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:29,840
you again for the whole session

00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,039
