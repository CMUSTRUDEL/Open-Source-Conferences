Title: #FOSSBack: Bertrand Delacretaz - The Moving House Model, adhocracy and remote collaboration
Publication date: 2021-02-25
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Moving house with the help of a group of friends is an interesting exercise in collective improvisation and coordination. Everybody can help with most of the jobs at hand, so the challenge is to keep people busy in a meaningful way, to make the best use of the physical and intellectual resources available, while keeping people happy and engaged.

Sounds familiar? The Moving House model does apply to other types of group projects, including software development. Adhocracy, Asynchronous Collaboration and a can-do attitude, as practiced in Open Source communities, are key elements that enable groups that have no formal structure to collaborate efficiently and smoothly - like when helping friends moving house.

In times where remote collaboration is more important than ever, we'll dig into the analogies between a simple group activity, such as moving lots of stuff from one place to another, and more complex projects. This will help us discover how to turn team members into "autonomous agents" with just the right amount of group coordination to make things happen.


This talk will help both managers and group members better understand how to collaborate remotely, and how to avoid the trap of "reproducing office life remotely" that is too common with remote collaboration in Covid-19 times.

	00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,560
so yeah yeah

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,400
might be surprised to see me in black

00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,599
and white and slice on black and white

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,719
as well i thought

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,799
you know it's a it's a low tech uh thing

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:15,759
that i'm taking as an example so why not

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,000
look low tech and

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,760
it you know shows my age as well so i

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,119
think it's probably useful

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,400
um so yeah i'm i work for adobe in

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,080
attached administratively attached to

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,519
the basel office nobody's going to the

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,000
basel office currently as you can

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,800
imagine

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,520
so but i've been working remotely

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:39,040
forever i would say for a very long time

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,079
at least um almost i would say 30 years

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,600
probably

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,760
so and i've been studying these things

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,600
you might have seen some of my other

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,360
talks on the topic so this one is a

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,719
brand new one you're being treated to

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,920
the beta version

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,840
of this of this talk about moving house

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,440
um i don't know how it works it's

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,079
probably different in different cultures

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,160
but in

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,239
in switzerland where i live it's very

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,840
common when you move house to ask

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,280
friends to come and help you know you

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,400
gather a team of friends

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,880
and you improvise the thing and and it

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,799
tends to work pretty well and i i've

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,960
done that a number of times obviously

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,280
and um i thought

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,240
there's many parallels between

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,159
successfully

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,280
organizing a moving day usually we do

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,520
that on one day you know

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,119
we prepare then the friends come for

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,119
just one day and then you make a big

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,439
effort and you move the whole stuff

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,320
and i realized that organizing this

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,240
successfully

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,159
that there's lots of parallels between

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,600
that and the asynchronous collaboration

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,680
that we need to do now

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:40,159
especially with these times of covid

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,759
if i can switch my slides yes so there i

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,439
think there are many parallels between

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,159
these activities and that's what we're

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,840
going to

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,320
to discuss in this talk

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,280
first obviously you need to make the

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,200
decision to move

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,880
and it's a big decision you know any

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,200
change that you take

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,799
you have to you make implies some risk

00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,119
way where you are is

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,719
often you're okay you think okay maybe

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,799
the new thing is better

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,719
but there's going to be things that are

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,000
not as good or initially not as good and

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,959
you need to work on them

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
so it's uh you know first you d you make

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,879
need to

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,200
make the decision and the parallel with

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,200
our

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,800
collaboration or software projects is

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,520
that you need to define the project's

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,080
vision

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,840
where is it that we're going in the

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,520
moving house case if people bring your

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,720
furniture to the wrong place it's not

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,080
very useful

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,319
so this is with moving is pretty useful

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,120
it's pretty easy you know you define

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,360
where you go

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,120
but still you need to to have a very

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,120
clear vision of your project

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,800
when is it going to happen how are you

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,000
going to set it up so this is the

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,319
equivalent of

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,840
clearly defining the project's vision

00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,879
and then um

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,000
you might be a bit afraid this is this

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,560
looks a bit like one

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,360
of our moves so i have a family with uh

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,200
three kids

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,640
and i've been because i've been working

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,280
home we had the office

00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,080
i had the office at home and stuff and

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:05,599
on one of our moves we had 160

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,360
of these boxes to move our stuff

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,519
and that that's a bit scary when you

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,000
think about it it's a lot of work so you

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,959
know

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,440
but no guts no glory you have to go go

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,920
for it

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,879
and take some risks and make some effort

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,400
and uh

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,000
you know and you hope you'll be

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,920
successful and you

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,120
you do what it takes to be successful

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,120
you don't just hope

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,159
so there's also lots of similarities

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,959
here between

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,680
embracing projects that might be might

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,080
seem a bit

00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,760
too big or too complicated or just you

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,000
know just above the level

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,519
where you're comfortable and that's

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,360
there's lots of rewards

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,440
associated to that so then once you have

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,840
decided that you want to move once you

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,480
have

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,360
overcome the fear of doing it you need

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,040
to prepare

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,760
and the anticipation preparation

00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,760
preparation is a

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,840
is a big part of being successful

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,920
exactly as in the software project

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,319
need to think you know how are things

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,560
going to happen maybe mentally go

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,239
through the steps and you know are we

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,319
going to have the right things when we

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,799
arrive at the new place and stuff

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,720
so before your team starts working you

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,000
need to to be serious about the the

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,360
preparation that

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,079
that you'll be doing so for

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,120
for your move you will invite friends

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,199
and actually

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,960
you invite the right friends you know

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,000
you know you know you folks know your

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,000
friends you know

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,440
some people talk a lot and they don't do

00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,440
much

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,880
others might not be in a good shape to

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,560
do a move you know if

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,720
they have a you know back problems or

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,000
yeah it might maybe they would they want

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,000
to come and help you

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,520
in a different way come clean up the old

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,759
flat after you move or

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,040
there's many other things you can do but

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,040
for this big day

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,240
you need the right team and assembling

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,800
the right team is very

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,840
important exactly as in a software

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,000
project you know

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,240
in open source it's cool because there's

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,560
this self selection usually

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,160
people start being useful and then you

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,880
realize that they are adding value to

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,479
the project

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,320
and you you integrate them in your

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,960
project in this case you have to in

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,800
advance

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,720
select the right people but because they

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,880
are your friends you know them so

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,000
you can you know you can assemble

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,080
hopefully the right team

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,840
being careful to have the right mix of

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,880
people in your on your team

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,199
right number as well

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,080
another part of the preparation that we

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,919
all love

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,919
when we're moving is to put things in

00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:26,880
boxes hopefully your boxes are a bit

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,600
smaller than these

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,440
than the ones we see here on the picture

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,840
and it's actually very important to have

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,160
the right size of boxes you know

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,120
if your boxes has two are too big or too

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,039
heavy

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,800
that the one person cannot carry them

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,680
it's much less convenient to organize

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,680
the stuff so we

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,600
will have some big things to move maybe

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,680
some larger furniture

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,440
but for the most part you want ideally

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,199
you want to have standardized

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,360
uh you know boxes in switzerland we

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,000
often use the banana

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,160
cardboard boxes that that the that the

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,919
stores use when received bananas and

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,520
sometimes they give them away so you can

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,319
get get them for free it's very

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,240
convenient

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,319
and if you have all boxes of the same

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,400
size or similar size

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,000
you know same size is very easy to put

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,960
in the in the truck when you're moving

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,280
your stuff

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,360
and the same weight or not going over a

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,560
certain weight is important so you don't

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,280
hurt your friends and they are

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,560
comfortable carrying them so it's a very

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,840
also very important planning

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,240
planning uh step in your in your move

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,000
and in the equivalent in software is

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,720
breaking your problem in smaller parts

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,039
you want to create a big software thing

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,360
or complicated complex software thing

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,440
we need to break that into smaller parts

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,440
of the right size and we usually use

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,360
tickets to do that in software

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,199
but the it's very much the same thing

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:48,880
you know breaking down your program

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,479
into small manageable parts

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,160
and you don't forget to label these

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,919
things if you

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,160
if you have ever ever done a move where

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,319
people didn't label the the boxes

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,960
it's a mess you know then you have to

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,800
ask maybe open the box to see what's in

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,400
it to find out where it goes in the new

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,479
flat that's not convenient at

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,240
all so you have to be very careful about

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,199
labeling thing here we have a great

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,720
example

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,800
where you know it's very obvious

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,199
sometimes you you have old cardboard

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,680
boxes from previous moves which have all

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,560
labor

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,479
so it's it's quickly messy so here i

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,560
think we have a good example

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,319
and the goal of this is to foster lose

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,560
coordination to foster

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,680
a kind of asynchronous coordination you

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,680
know on the day

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,520
everybody will be there but you want

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,800
your people to act as autonomous

00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,759
autonomous agents

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,599
to be look at the box oh this is glasses

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,479
it's fragile it goes in the kitchen i

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,800
know what to do

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:42,639
you don't have to go and ask the who's

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,400
who you know the leader of the move

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,720
exactly what to do with this box it's

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,599
obvious and it's the same thing software

00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,199
you want to

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,599
when you create your tickets for your

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,840
project or wiki pages that define

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,199
what to do you have to be careful about

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,000
how you label things

00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,919
so that they can be people can be as

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,319
autonomous as possible in working on

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,759
that

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,759
that step of the project

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,039
okay so you have done your preparation

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,759
you think you're good

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,280
and then comes the big day you're up

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,080
early in the morning waiting for your

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,400
friends to show

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,400
up and you know enough planning now you

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,759
need to start doing that's that's when

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,000
it happens

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,360
still you have to be careful about

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,199
having the right elements

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,960
so that you you'll be successful um

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,639
i have the right tools you need some

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,840
tools maybe to disassemble some

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,320
furniture

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,320
there's always been some unknowns in the

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,240
new flat maybe something was not

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,599
set up properly and you need to fix

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,080
things to put your

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,279
your new furniture in place so you be

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,880
you're careful to

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,399
you know have the right set of tools

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,640
exactly as in software

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,760
uh my math teacher back in school used

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,240
to say

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,160
good craftsmen have good tools you know

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,040
to do a good job you need good tools and

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,640
that's important

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,160
and before your friends show up you

00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,560
clean up all the sharp things you know

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,880
you

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,040
you've been preparing things in the flat

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,680
maybe disassembling some things already

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,360
there might be

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,760
loose nails on the floor you don't want

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,320
people to get hurt so you create a safe

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,800
space

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,480
for your team to operate exactly as we

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,800
as you do in software

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,640
you know in terms of uh people having

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,160
good workstations being

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:22,000
economic way to work

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,480
and you know being having friendly

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,040
atmosphere a positive atmosphere on the

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,959
team

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,720
exactly the same thing so the the

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,279
analogy with that is cleaning up the

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,680
floors

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,440
and making sure there's no dangerous

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,519
things around when your friend

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,240
when your friends come and uh and start

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,240
doing their work

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,160
and you provide food and beverages of

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,320
course this team will need to

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,480
to drink something to to have something

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:49,440
to eat during the day so they can stay

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,959
productive you know and efficient and

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,880
there's many different tastes

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,720
if you have a diverse group you need a

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,959
diverse set of food

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,240
so that everybody everybody can stay

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,640
happy and healthy

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,279
during your your big moving day the

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,040
analogy

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,440
in software is to create a productive

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,680
and sustainable environment to make sure

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,920
you know your co-workers are fed

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,440
intellectually and practically and you

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,320
know physically and everything

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,800
so it's uh that's the analogies i see

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
here

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,800
in the food that you provide for your

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,800
friends compared to providing a

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,200
productive sustainable environment for

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,480
your

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,480
for your software team

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,800
and you share the plan when your friends

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,279
arrive it's very important to orient

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,279
them

00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,200
to explain them how the thing is going

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,000
to work you know how you have organized

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,000
things how you have labeled the boxes

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,680
what you shouldn't do or what you should

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
be careful of you know these

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,920
these are the boxes which are fragile

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,680
they have red labels be careful with

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,760
these or don't put them in a big truck

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,519
we'll put them in a small car

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,959
to to be more careful about them and so

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,800
on there's many things

00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,480
that for you might be obvious but for

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,079
your friends maybe they

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,839
they did different moves with different

00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,320
people and they have different ideas of

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,640
how

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,440
how this should go so you have to to

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,360
explain

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,560
you know what's your vision of how

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,279
things are going to go

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:09,680
how to find information and make sure

00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,519
everybody has the same information

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,720
that's a problem that i see often in

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,720
software projects

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,079
where everybody has a different piece of

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,920
the information

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,839
and and they don't have the overview and

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,120
it can be very hard then to coordinate

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,320
especially if you have to do this

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,800
asynchronously

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,399
so sharing the plan here we do it you

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,920
know speaking to your friends

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,760
but it can also be in written form

00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:33,040
there's many many ways of

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,519
doing that and then it starts

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,320
people start moving things you know you

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,160
can uh

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,360
at some point you have to stop talking

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,120
and start doing

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,120
and maybe when your friends arrive

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,640
someone has a great idea yeah i think we

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,360
should do it like that or maybe we

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,519
should think about a better way to go

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,200
to the other place you know better road

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,360
or something

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,279
it's good but at some point you okay now

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,160
it's 9 00 a.m or it's 10 am we have to

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,720
to get going

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,720
so yeah same thing in software if you

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,720
talk for too long you will go nowhere so

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,639
at some point you have to decide okay

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,800
we think we have enough information to

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,519
get started so let's actually get

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,000
starting and get started and start

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,600
carrying

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,120
stuff and

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,399
you probably have some specialists in

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,600
your friends maybe you have someone

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,600
who's a carpenter

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,279
who's you know used to assembling

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,200
furniture disassembling

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,760
being careful about that here we see

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,519
this uh these folks with white gloves

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,440
they're very careful about how they do

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,720
it so if you are someone who is

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,399
especially good at

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,040
doing something you want to put them in

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,320
that slot you know in that that task

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,399
that's where they'll be efficient

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,839
they'll be happy others might be happy

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,760
because they don't have to do that thing

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,000
that they don't really know how to do

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,360
it's the same thing sometimes there's a

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,880
illusion in software

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,519
and you know among software engineers

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,079
that people are interchangeable

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,360
that can be the case up to a point but

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,440
you know it's like or

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,120
if you do soccer you want to put people

00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,200
on the right spot in the field

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,800
it's exactly the same thing try to take

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,920
advantage of everybody's

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,440
uh specific uh capabilities and and

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,680
skills

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,639
um on the other hand you still need to

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,800
be you know

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,800
somewhat interchangeable if one of these

00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,959
guys is is sick on the day

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,480
someone will need to to sub for them and

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:20,000
you know take on their work

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,560
so you shouldn't be too um you know too

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,320
too

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,320
particular about okay this is my

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,040
specialty only do disassembling

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,920
assembling

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,040
uh furniture it's not good you have to

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,440
be flexible

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,720
while recognizing the special special

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,320
skills of people is

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:40,160
exactly the same in software once again

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,399
okay so you know you reach destination

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,480
i'm not saying anything on the the big

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,279
truck and driving it there's there'll

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,519
probably be a number of a number of

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:52,480
interesting things to say but let's

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,600
skip that and you know you reach the

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,480
destination

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,399
uh now you're ready to start putting

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,839
actually stuff in the new flat and

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,399
arranging everything so it's so it's

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,120
fine

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,800
and i think again you probably welcome

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,959
an orient people there so you'll

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,959
if you're leading the the move you'll be

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,880
there first and then you'll show people

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,279
around maybe we have them visit

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,959
the the flat the new flat quickly and

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,519
you explain them again how it's

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,440
things are set up here for example maybe

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,600
you put sheets on the doors to explain

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,839
what goes in this room or even what

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,160
what the name of this room is so that

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,720
people can match it to the labels

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,240
maybe in the rooms you have signs that

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,480
say here you should put

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,240
cardboard boxes which are still full

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,199
here's where the bed goes or maybe you

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,240
have a plan

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:41,839
you know you have your your vision of

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,040
how the flat should end up

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,160
and and uh and maybe you even did some

00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,920
plans i don't know

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,279
but you have to communicate this vision

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,440
to the people and

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,720
here if you have a big team this is a

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,199
pretty big flat so may

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,120
you might have a big team to move uh you

00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:57,680
probably need some written explanations

00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,680
you know

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,519
if people have to come to you every time

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,720
they have a question oh where does this

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,360
box go

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,880
how do we put the couch you will waste a

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,160
lot of time communicating

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,160
and not actually doing work so

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,360
it can be very useful to have written

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,120
instructions that you

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,800
you will put in the right places in the

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,079
flat and it's exactly the same in

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,199
software you know

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,480
sometimes uh especially in large

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,120
organizations people

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,079
who do lots of meetings and they talk a

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,160
lot

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,360
it's good i mean i'm not saying you

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,440
shouldn't talk but

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,880
you the written form is extremely

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,800
efficient when you need to

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,920
help people to coordinate loosely or

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,839
asynchronously

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,519
and it's the same here in your flat

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,399
maybe some written instructions will

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,160
help people

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,920
figure out things without having to come

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,759
to you all the time and ask you

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,759
and then waste time in communicating

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,040
and you will check the food and

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,040
beverages again you know people

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,720
they have started to eat some stuff

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,480
there some things are missing

00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,800
you will make sure that there's again

00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,959
enough to keep people productive

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,320
and engaged and it's the same thing

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,120
again in software

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,519
uh you know creating a big software

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,000
project is more like a marathon it's

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,920
okay we work sometimes in sprints but i

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,560
think the whole project is a marathon so

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,800
you need

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,160
energy you need uh you know food for the

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,880
people be it in

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,440
intellectual food or you know physical

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,199
food

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,040
but in this case you need to make sure

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,040
there's enough enough

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,480
fuel i would say to keep the people

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,079
productive and engaged so we

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,880
you will do that several times during

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:33,040
the day probably

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,320
and you are here to help even if you

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,480
have written instructions

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,759
which is great uh there are some

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,079
detailed questions

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,160
that that people need to rely you know

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,000
they need to count on you for

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,199
so you'll be here you'll be available to

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,720
answer questions

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,880
but you want to restrict that to the

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,680
specific questions which are not covered

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,519
by the the

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,959
no the written instructions that that

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,880
you wrote and that's

00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,720
it's an it's a you need to find the

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,199
right balance you don't want to spend

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,759
too much time doing tons of complicated

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:03,279
written instructions but you want to be

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,160
available for the

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,439
the harder or things that are harder to

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,600
explain or where you have a very

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,319
specific idea i want this thing exactly

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,559
here

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,679
and so you need to be around and you

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,839
need to be

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,360
to free up your time to be available to

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:20,000
help your team

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,640
it's the same way uh in a software team

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,199
you know this

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,679
serve service information is needed and

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,559
and

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,240
very useful but it it doesn't cannot do

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,960
everything you need to find

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,640
when do you switch to spoken one to one

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,640
or smaller team conversation

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,919
to make sure the information and the

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,760
vision is clearly

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,000
communicated so it's it's a difficult

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:43,520
balance to find in there especially

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,280
in a larger software project

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,799
okay so it's getting you know you're

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,919
getting there uh

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:52,559
you have moved most of the furniture but

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,360
then you know the end is very long

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,919
usually

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,799
uh that's you know things goes start to

00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,880
slow down

00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:00,880
and there's still a lot of small things

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,720
to do which are not maybe obvious

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,880
but need to be done for the for the job

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,600
to be finished it's not finished until

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,640
it is and

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,640
how do you decide that

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,760
one very important thing that i realized

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,240
when i when i go and help friends move

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,120
is that you have to be to to be doing

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,160
useful work

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,840
all the time often uh when you're

00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,240
helping people move there's many things

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,000
you can do yes i can carry a box i can

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,720
maybe paint this door if it needs to be

00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,200
painted or

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,160
i can reassemble this cupboard or things

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,559
like that

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,080
the trick if you want the team to be

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,480
efficient is that everybody

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,080
should always be doing something useful

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,440
maybe it's they're not what they thought

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,440
they would do

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,520
maybe they'll get a bit messy by by

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,080
doing you know the painting

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,720
um maybe they'll be tidy in the evening

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,039
but

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,280
you try to be useful all the time find a

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,960
slot where you can do something useful

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,280
it's the same in a software project if

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,440
especially if when you're in a crisis

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,960
uh you know that there's many things to

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,320
do and then you might need to

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,400
autonomously find

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,840
find something that you can do grab a

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,880
ticket work on it

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,039
implement it and and help you know do

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,120
provide concrete help to the project

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,799
that's like like the bees here which are

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,440
very autonomous

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,200
and they each do very small things but

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:21,919
together it creates something

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:24,400
much better or much larger i would say

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,039
and uh yeah i mentioned i don't had her

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,440
crassy

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,880
in the in the abstract of this talk and

00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,720
i think it fits very well

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,919
in this context you know if you look in

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,320
wikipedia

00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,559
uh this is the definite uh an excerpt of

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:38,160
the definition from wikipedia

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,000
it's defined by a lack of formal

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,320
structure of course when you're

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,679
moving house with with friends we don't

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,840
define a

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,000
you know a master of the cupboards on a

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,919
master of the boxes

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,440
it's all very loose and and there's no

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,520
no formal structure

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,720
and people have to be adaptive creative

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,640
and flexible

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,320
so so you know so it's efficient so

00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,280
you're not arguing about who should do

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,280
what just do it

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,400
you know go i can do that i do it okay

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,559
done fine

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,720
and that's that's very similar to uh the

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,880
hawker a democracy

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,400
and the one thing that's if you look at

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,600
the adequacy definition

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,640
they say the cost of communication can

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,640
be very high

00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,720
because you need to coordinate you need

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,559
you know you need all these

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,039
semi-autonomous agents they need to

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:25,360
coordinate for it to be to be efficient

00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,720
and that's i think with what we defined

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,039
having a clear vision

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,960
having written form explanations that

00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:33,600
people can use in search service

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,080
i think you can read drastically reduce

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,919
the cost

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,200
and that's what we see in open source

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:39,200
projects where

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,320
uh you know the cost of communications

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,520
it's uh

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:46,320
it's you know it's not a problem because

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,120
we're used to asynchronous communication

00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,799
written communication and and i think

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,799
there's again many parallels here

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,799
okay so uh now it's really you know it's

00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,360
really getting down your flat looks like

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,320
how you imagine it would more or less

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,840
you think you have

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,919
good enough conditions to spend the

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,880
night here and eat in the morning

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,880
so it's it's you know it's getting good

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,480
and it's important to decide

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,720
when to stop you know when is good

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,720
enough i'm not sure if this picture

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,720
would be good enough for all of us

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,720
but maybe you know if your flat still

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,120
looks like that but your bedroom is

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,360
ready

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,880
you can sleep the kitchen is good enough

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,840
so you can eat in the morning

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,360
you can take care of that later and good

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,240
enough might be different from one

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,480
person to the

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,919
to the other but it's very important to

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,559
define when it's good enough and you

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,640
don't want to

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:39,120
this to drag on and your friends to get

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,159
you know tired and angry oh this is

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,440
you know this is really uh lasting too

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,120
long it doesn't work

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,720
so you will have to define what is good

00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,200
enough and

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,880
as in software nothing's ever 100

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,000
finished at some point you need to let

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:54,159
go and say okay

00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,360
this good enough it it fulfills the

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,080
criteria

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,480
uh even if it's not perfect everywhere

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,360
and

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,760
we we can go on so again a strong

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,280
parallel here

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,120
and then you will have to invite people

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,640
to stop and some of them will not be

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,320
willing to stop they say no you know i

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,799
can still arrange this carpet

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,720
okay the painting here the you know the

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,799
painted door i can do another layer

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,039
or he said no no it's good enough we

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:21,200
stopped and now we have to celebrate

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:22,320
you know it's important as well when

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,440
you're finished

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,120
um you want you know you did

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,039
great things with your friends and you

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,720
have to celebrate and enjoy it maybe

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,440
someone's bringing pizza or some other

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,640
food

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,320
and and you have a good time you know

00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,679
after all this hard work you need a

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,720
reward you need to

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,400
to rejoice together it's the same thing

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,080
in software teams you know when you

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,520
reach good milestones it's great to have

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,080
a celebration

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,520
uh whatever you can do in these days of

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,679
of covid and

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,880
physical distance but there's many cool

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:53,679
things that you can do and it's

00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,320
important to

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,320
to do them

00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,760
and in the end of you know at the end of

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,000
the day you are probably very tired

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,480
about all this preparation all this

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,720
coordination all this this work

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,320
and but you're very happy you know we

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,080
made it uh

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,480
it doesn't come for free it was a big

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,360
effort and you you put the effort in

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,720
you you did your best and you find ways

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,799
to make things work

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,840
and then you can be can be very happy

00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,840
about it

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,320
and that's it you know it worked we

00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,240
moved it's sometimes

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,360
if you looked at the pile of stuff that

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,600
you had to move

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,799
and you said by by myself it would be

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,559
impossible

00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,000
but your friends showed up and you made

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,039
it and you organized it and you

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,799
coordinated

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:43,200
and if you do it in a way that people

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,520
can be autonomous agents more or less

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,120
it will be much more enjoyable and much

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,279
more efficient

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,159
so i think there are many parallels

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,320
between

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,840
moving house and creating software

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,320
projects hope these

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,520
simple principles can help you remember

00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,279
what we can do

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,520
to make our software projects better and

00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:02,799
more efficient and we see a lot of that

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,600
in the open source

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,799
communities you know that's uh many of

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,080
these techniques

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:11,600
and principles are in in everyday

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,600
you know they are applied in in open

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,200
source communities and

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,279
you know it also works in large

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,760
organizations companies whatever

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,720
you can really use the same principles

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,360
so i hope this

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,880
analogy has been interesting to you and

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,120
it you know it will

00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,080
hopefully help you remember how to

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,000
structure

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,000
and organize your projects to be to be

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,480
more efficient

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,360
we have four minutes i think left for

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,760
questions

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:42,559
so uh um alexander if you have any

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:44,080
i'm happy to take them hey bertrand so

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,520
it's josh here i'm gonna

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,360
field any questions we're just waiting

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,840
for our job to come in

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,880
uh and uh kevin from the chat just

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,640
mentions uh

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,480
it's like minimum viable product as

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,640
applied to moving house

00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,640
uh which seems yeah the analogy seems to

00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,480
work it works for me as i'm listening to

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,000
this i can totally see it

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,679
um while we're waiting for questions

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,360
come in i actually have a quick

00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:09,200
question myself where um i

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,279
i joined a distributed company so i work

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,400
for elastic i joined a distributed

00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,360
company and what i noticed

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,720
coming from a normal company um was that

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,840
there really was a lot of

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,880
uh optimizing for uh these autonomous

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,480
agents

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,760
and you talk a lot about the balance

00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,200
between you know making sure that

00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,080
there's there's still a team and there's

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,480
team support

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,080
i'm wondering if you have any tips for

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,960
what's a good way to find that balance

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,279
to not have

00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,200
you know people working at home or in

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,640
their corner alone completely alone and

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,400
isolated from the team

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,840
versus what you may find in a more

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,320
traditional

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,840
in in situ team where everything is

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,840
actually optimized for

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,679
team function and and kind of group

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,480
think what are some ways that you found

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,159
that can

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,320
you can strike a good balance between

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:56,000
these two

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:59,120
so i think a nice way of of you know

00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,039
i think the way we we like to work when

00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,799
we're doing creative work is as a team

00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,080
you know i love the brainstorming

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:05,679
sessions when you're all

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,320
in the same room and you have white

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:11,440
boards and you you collaborate with that

00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,480
uh it's very hard to do in a in a purely

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,159
remote setting

00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,760
i think the nice way is to alternate

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,080
between periods where okay

00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,039
okay you're at home you're you know you

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,360
can organize as

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:23,039
uh how however you want you're working

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,279
alone or maybe in teams of

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,159
two or three on your stuff and then a

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,559
phase is when you

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,080
get together with a larger team and

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,080
there's many ways to organize like

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,559
virtual hackathons today

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,159
we did that in my my team in my company

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,480
a few few weeks ago

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,159
where we everybody would work would work

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,720
in their corner but we had

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,840
two short meetings morning and afternoon

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,240
and so beginning

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,760
and end of the day to come together and

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,400
one someone will explain what they've

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,720
been doing

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,559
demonstrate and that so i think it made

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,640
for a good balance of

00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,720
being quiet on your own and efficient

00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,000
and then having some social interaction

00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:01,120
some social aspect

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,279
one fun thing that we did was um

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,320
each team had to find a name for their

00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:07,279
team on

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,240
on one of the days in these daily uh

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,080
short meetings

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,159
we had to wear something that that

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,640
matches that matches the name of your

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,880
team

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,279
so we were my team we were the mad

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,559
hatters so we were wearing crazy hats

00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,640
for this meeting and it

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:22,159
you know it reproduce a bit of the of

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,679
the social interaction but i think

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,240
alternating between

00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,039
alone time and group time as much as we

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,440
can uh

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:31,120
can help for that yeah that makes a lot

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,559
of sense that really strikes a chord

00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,640
with me being an introvert as i think

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,880
many distributed workers are

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,679
it's nice to have that mix of the two of

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,880
them

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:43,600
so somebody uh on the chat asks um

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,440
this question from malvika uh what

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,080
happens when this group of friends do

00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,960
this kind of move on a regular basis can

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,120
they build a

00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,720
government governance structure of

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,440
decision making

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,520
well that's an interesting question so i

00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,600
never had the same groups of friends

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,919
twice so they are they're always

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,919
different and i think that that's that's

00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,159
a big advantage of that and maybe we

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,080
need to reproduce that in our teams

00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,399
if you if you have always the same team

00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,480
things tend to solidify and then

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,320
you know exactly how the other one is

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,799
going to react and make things sometimes

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,000
harder

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,159
so i think it's good to have some

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
rotation on maybe or maybe if you do

00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,679
these workshops that we're discussing

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,840
if i invite someone who's totally

00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,279
strange you know you know who's a total

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,600
stranger to your team

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,559
and and i think they can bring some

00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,360
fresh ideas

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:32,159
that's what i see when moving houses yes

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,919
no

00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,200
some even someone who can be active you

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,159
know help okay

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,679
they have to know a bit of the

00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,520
techniques but maybe from different

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,640
group or different culture

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:45,840
so so no mixed thing up mix things up i

00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,840
would say

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,240
