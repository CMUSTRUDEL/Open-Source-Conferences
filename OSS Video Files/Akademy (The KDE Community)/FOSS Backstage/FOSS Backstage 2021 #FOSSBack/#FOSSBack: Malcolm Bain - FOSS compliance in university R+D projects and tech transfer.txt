Title: #FOSSBack: Malcolm Bain - FOSS compliance in university R+D projects and tech transfer
Publication date: 2021-02-25
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	University based hackers are some of the most prolific and participative open source contributors. Many University and other public R+D centres have little idea how much FOSS they are producing, nor how much they are using. This has two implications: inbound compliance with third party open source, particularly on subsequent tech transfer (distribution); and outbound license choice and the impacts in terms of licensing, confidentiality, community building, and university processes. R+D proyects have certain characteristics (how they are developed, university rights, ownership, etc,) that make governance and compliance "interesting" to say the least. I, open source lawyer for nigh on 20 years, will tell you some horror (and success) stories.

thank you again to the organizers for

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,160
inviting me this is the second talk

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,320
i had a great talk yesterday with andy

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,360
katz another open source lawyer

00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,240
on um open source public open source law

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,039
uh

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,760
projects um today i'm want to have a

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,039
very quick

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,080
look at um another work i'm doing

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,160
on open source in the area of r d a

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,160
research and development and university

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,359
um a lot of open source comes from

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,600
universities

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,960
and we're seeing actually that although

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,320
the projects are great and there's lots

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,680
of scientific quality and there's lots

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,840
of things going on there

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,719
um when it comes to complying with the

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,040
licensing and

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,160
actually getting things right let's say

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,320
um things are not

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,600
necessarily up to scratch so i've been

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,480
asked to advise in a couple of

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,920
universities

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,719
um to to help them sort this out and get

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,840
into some

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,000
best practices and processes in uh

00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,079
in working and managing open source in

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,600
these projects

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,159
just to situate you um a quick user

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,519
story

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,280
this is kind of like compiling some

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,760
ideas together imagine you're

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,000
or i am a researcher at the university

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,119
i've got to create some form of

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,439
ai model for a hospital who wants to do

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,000
some

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,640
image recognition for i don't know bones

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,240
or brains or whatever

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,159
and so i'm doing lots of research and

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,840
i'm pulling from the internet lots of

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,280
already existing software modules

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,000
there's there's loads of

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,200
open source modules uh for ai already on

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,560
the web there's lots of models there's

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,200
lots of data as well

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,240
which i can pull not just uh data from

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,040
the hospital because they're going to

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,720
give me some

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,400
images of the bones that i'm going to be

00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,520
working with but also there are lots of

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,880
databases of bones

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,840
out there under so-called open licenses

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,600
or not

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,360
and all this i'm running on an open

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,320
source stack obviously with linux and

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,520
various other

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,200
bits and pieces um just to facilitate

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,960
um sharing because this is a

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,600
collaborative research project

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,560
with other people with other uh research

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,320
entities

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,399
and i have to actually deliver this to

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,960
the hospital i'm going to containerize

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,160
this

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:11,200
uh with doc or whatever and deliver

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,239
so this fairly classical story of um r

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,120
d at the university raises a fair number

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,760
of issues

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,800
in relation to what one needs to do to

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,040
make sure that this is

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,959
um done correctly from a legal point of

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,440
view so um

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,440
basically what we hear what we're having

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,319
is that research and development

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,280
which is a very open environment uh lots

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,280
of freedom to

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,040
to research to do things freedom to

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,000
share freedom to collaborate

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,280
um meets up with foss compliance so here

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,560
we go

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,800
they're not at loggerheads they're not

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,720
against each other but um

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,000
the idea is just to make sure that when

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,640
you're doing r d

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,360
the the the legal quality of your work

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,599
is uh

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,480
is important it's probably not as

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,879
important

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,160
as the scientific quality but it to

00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,360
actually be able to deliver and

00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,840
distribute

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,360
the software legally you do need to

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,599
comply with the licenses

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,640
so as we know from foss compliance and

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,800
i've seen that

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,080
here backstage this year a number of

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,800
colleagues of

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,840
mine have been talking about open chain

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,840
which i will mention

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,400
and other forms of licensing compliance

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,000
and activities

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,440
we all know that open source has a

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,720
license these licenses

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,120
do have conditions it's not free-for-all

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,280
that would be public domain and there's

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,440
some specific licenses like the copyleft

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,519
licenses with this and the copyleft

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:34,720
obligations to use the same license

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,080
when you redistribute okay so um

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,760
and that's a little bit of red tape

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,640
that's a bit of a headache um

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,680
and researchers are not very keen in

00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,959
getting on with that

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,959
so so the experience i've had is that um

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,640
apart from the the headache not really

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,239
keen to to do all the paperwork of

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,120
looking at licenses and doing a license

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,120
inventory

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,400
um there's not much understanding or not

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,480
good understanding

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,720
among researchers of the different

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,799
flavors of open source licensing

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,560
um and there's a general idea that well

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,640
it's open there we can use it i'm

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,760
i'm at the research institution so i can

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,560
do what i want

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,120
and unfortunately that is not the case

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,080
okay

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,799
also i find that um no criticisms but

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,560
but

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,920
the software development is very

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,840
disorganized from

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,199
from people who are working already in

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,600
github or gitlab

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,240
and and have got all everything managed

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,320
properly

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,639
to people who just do their work on

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,520
their laptop and store the stuff in

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,639
google drive or dropbox um or even on

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,880
the local drive

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,080
that's a nightmare in terms of

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,560
management

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,720
for the research group for the tech

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,479
transfer office for the university

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,320
because if people don't really know

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,600
where that software is and how it's been

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,639
developed and managed

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,639
then very difficult to know the ip

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,000
and can we transfer this or can we

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,199
distribute can we even release it as

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,759
free software

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,120
and to society okay and another

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,680
dimension here which is really important

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,320
is

00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,960
there's a significant amount of sharing

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,199
of

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,360
code among developers not just

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,479
internally within the same

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,720
university but among universities

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,000
among entities in these big european

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,000
research projects with private

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,440
companies public companies uh public

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,360
entities so

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,880
um there's lots of sharing going on and

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,720
we know that when we share we're

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,919
distributing and when we distribute

00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,960
we have to look at the licenses so um

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:27,360
the the idea here is is basically to

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,880
look at the challenges that are specific

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,240
to university r d

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,160
they're not the same as private

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,280
companies or as individuals

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,919
working independently um and see how we

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,919
can

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,520
adjust these and what should we do what

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,720
we implement okay not going to go

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,360
through all these issues

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,400
but um we're noticing that universities

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,880
do want to release

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,240
as open source and they think some of

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,440
them just think that putting on github

00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,280
that's it

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,800
and as you know we have to have a

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,360
license we need to check their

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,960
ip and there's all sorts of technical

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,880
and organizational issues

00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,800
um that you have to take care of as well

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,360
so just just checking up on the internet

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,759
is not

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:08,000
freeing software um there also there are

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,120
tech transfer issues here tech transfer

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,400
is the office

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,479
of the university which is looking at

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,919
the research and saying what can we

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,160
transfer to society

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,160
what can we license for money you know

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,639
get some funding for new research

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,319
um and and who can we collaborate with

00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,720
in society you know industry

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,520
public sector to to to work on these

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
projects

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,720
and and obviously when you're

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,919
transferring out of the university

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,919
into society again

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,960
we're distributing we need to take care

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,240
of the the ip

00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,240
and the licensing issues um so here

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,960
comes the the knight in white armor

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,440
um we've been working in the open source

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,560
law

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:49,840
uh area for the last 10 years

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,440
and you've probably heard already too

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,479
much about open chain but it's a

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,520
standard now it's a

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:58,800
it's an iso standard uh and basically

00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,000
it's a set of best practices for open

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,400
source development

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,520
to ensure that um in this case the

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,280
supply chain

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,280
is compliant so when you have a supply

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,800
chain of four or five different

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:13,039
uh entities involved

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,800
the compliance goes down the chain and

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,599
so the person who's distributing it at

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,919
the end

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,680
whether it's a car for a manufacturer or

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,759
a modem manufacturer or whatever

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,919
technology

00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,680
they know that all everything coming

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,400
upstream from other people

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,639
is compliant and makes the makes the the

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,639
whole

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,280
issue of of compliance much easier if

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,960
everybody's done their homework

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,400
okay so there's a best practice out

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,680
there and what we're trying to do and

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,280
the projects i'm working on

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,680
is to bring open chain into the

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,240
university and it's not where it's not

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,520
easy

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,840
openten is aimed at um private companies

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,759
large uh industrial supply chains and

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,520
although the universities are members

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,599
of those supply chains you know this

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,560
quadruple helix type idea

00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,000
um they're not used to the the the

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,479
diligence and the

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,120
the rigor of of of private companies and

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,360
and proper

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,160
i would say uh software development

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,759
practices

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,440
okay so what have we got we've got a

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,120
process we've got a specification

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,800
there's even a website where you can go

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,120
and visit all that stuff

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,120
okay and what i'm doing at the um these

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,759
universities is trying to implement

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,479
these best practices in the r d

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,680
department

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,080
and it's a bit like hitting my head

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,080
against a wall um because

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,280
you know there's these large 250

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,520
software developers and

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,440
or or or scientists working in in

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,680
biochemistry or whatever

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,279
and and they're they're not very keen to

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,880
know about licensing

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,800
but it's important and when they

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,399
actually do get the the story

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,159
they say yeah that's true that's really

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,680
important okay so

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,519
the goal is really is to ensure

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,000
compliance which is obviously a good

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,080
thing

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,760
it makes makes the university legal no

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,240
one can sue the university

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,160
for breach of the open source licenses

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,200
which is a good thing um

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,360
in it's also to establish best practices

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,640
in in compliance but also that's married

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,519
to best practices and software

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,560
development

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,959
because if you if you're developing code

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,640
in in a quality manner you know quality

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,360
practices then obviously the license

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,000
comes in as an element of this quality

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,839
okay and the other thing office is well

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,839
if if you do have

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,120
research software which is properly

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,880
compliant and ip's

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,040
cleared and you know what license you

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,920
want to use then it's very easy

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,279
to release uh as uh open source

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,680
correctly

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,200
on the web or to anybody else so i think

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,839
it's an important thing and all this

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,720
falls within the umbrella these days of

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,519
open science

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,560
and making sure that um when you do open

00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,320
science in this sense

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,839
uh whether it's data whether it's code

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,399
whether it's whatever else

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,880
um that then you are complying with

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,720
everything

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,920
in the right manner okay so i'm not

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,279
going to go through the details of here

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,360
it's the typical mission

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,320
of setting up um some procedures in the

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,040
policy

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,000
um identifying the people who are going

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,959
to be helping

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,680
work with um compliance giving them the

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,600
tools

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,279
training the staff so it's a typical con

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,760
life like you know

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:06,640
mission to to implement some some best

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,640
practices

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,800
okay and we did the first stage that we

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:14,160
did last year in the middle of covet

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,839
um open chain has five chapters uh

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,399
the first one is program foundation so

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,360
basically setting it up

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,120
the policy overall policy competences

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,800
the second one is tasks which is

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,200
identifying who does what

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,640
and with what resources in terms of

00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,480
identifying licenses

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,079
identifying the code storing the

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,920
materials everything

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,440
the third one is review and approval

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,480
which is actually looking at a real

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,480
project and saying

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,480
you are using these licenses and these

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,160
components and therefore you must comply

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,800
with these obligations

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,360
okay fourth chapter keeping that

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,680
evidence

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,800
that's really important because so many

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,120
research projects

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,959
um just kind of like they start and then

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,279
if there's no proof of concept or

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,800
it didn't really work it is dropped the

00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,519
code's still there and they may even be

00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,600
shared

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,079
but you know you lose the evidences you

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,880
have of what software was used and how

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,279
it was used

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,160
very important and the final point

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,160
engagement

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,079
which is the final chapter is best

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,079
practices in engaging with the open

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,720
source community

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,560
and and getting contributions or setting

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,880
up your own open source project

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,320
and and building a community okay so

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,399
this is the project and

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,399
and we we had some um we had first

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,360
iteration we looked at some projects

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,800
um you know quite quite agile style and

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,760
and we got some we came to some

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,240
conclusions here

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,959
on on you know we we drew some pictures

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,360
of how

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,959
the process could be done and in fit

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,519
into the specific r d

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,360
process which is not quite the same

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,360
process as an industrial process

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,200
for building software for a client or

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,640
even an open source process because

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,519
that's much more um

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,399
not disorganized but not coherently or

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,079
necessarily

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:57,279
structured in a hierarchical manner okay

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,959
um conclusions well um the first

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,120
conclusions are that actually

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,320
when you get over the barrier of of

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,279
being a lawyer

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,800
telling these things um the research are

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,760
actually quite key not on it they do

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,440
understand that there's a there's

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,040
something important there

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,560
and it's seen as part of the quality of

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,200
their research so um

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,000
that's important it's also seen as an

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,720
enabler

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,320
for sharing so so if they what they

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,399
don't want is to want to share

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,600
code with another university or to

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,480
deliver to a client

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,040
you know some contract research and

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,800
suddenly

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,079
the tech transfer office puts up a red

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,959
flag and says oops

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,399
sorry this is full of gpl copy left code

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,480
and we agreed to sell this

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,040
under a proprietary license you know a

00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:41,360
commissioned um

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,480
sponsored development with a private

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,519
client and

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,839
and that's kind of like a we have a

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,760
contradiction between the gpl

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:50,959
requirement to to distribute under the

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,320
gpl

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:56,560
and the contract with the private entity

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,000
that they want the ipr and not to be

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,160
bound by copyleft

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,079
okay so it's an important thing for them

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,200
they suddenly realize this is important

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,160
okay but there are a number of

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,839
challenges challenges relating to where

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,920
general awareness so not just

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,360
the people we work with but but a

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,480
cultural awareness that this is

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,399
important

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,399
um there's usually no procedures and

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,839
guidelines on how to deal with this

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,720
um you know we can all go on stack

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,959
overflow where everybody can go to

00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,399
openchainproject.org

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,079
and they can learn but it's quite

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,120
difficult

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:29,200
um they need some tools um we've worked

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,920
with several departments some of them

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,440
have a centralized gitlab and a great

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,079
repository infrastructure

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,120
and they've taught how to use and work

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,720
with gitlab get

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,720
get get procedures you know pull

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,240
requests etc emerges

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,480
fine and they've got the repository they

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,160
can do a backup they can store things

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,480
as i said other people just do it on

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,320
their laptop or a piece of paper

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,519
and then then to do any license

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,959
compliance there is complete is

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,120
completely impossible

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,440
okay and the general end so the second

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,600
stage of what we're doing

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,040
so we did a pilot we look we sorted out

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,600
what the problems were

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,199
we and in agile terms we we have a

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,199
backlog of things to do

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,480
when we actually have a whole epic um

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,480
that we have to deploy but

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,920
our work on but anyway so what we want

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,800
to do is to set up

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,320
um a competence center and this is

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,360
becoming quite fashionable um the

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,519
european union

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,959
commission has just published a paper or

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,760
is about to publish it but it's least

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,279
it's it's

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:27,120
been uh made public about um open source

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,440
in the in the european union and one of

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:33,199
their big recommendations is setting up

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,760
a what they call ospose open source um

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,040
offices okay competence officers this is

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,959
a bit the same

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,720
what we're saying is that well someone

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:42,480
in the university and here it's probably

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,279
the tech transfer office

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,399
because they're the most um keen to get

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:48,480
this right

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,160
um how needs to have the skills i have

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,639
the documents the materials

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,800
to be able to be an evangelist and and

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,480
transmit this to the research groups

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,920
okay so we're setting up a competence

00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,680
center it's going to take us about six

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:03,760
months

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:06,399
focusing on awareness understanding

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,800
getting concrete processes and materials

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,680
for the research groups to to absorb

00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,800
and to work with and to coordinate

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,839
amongst research centers because

00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,480
universities have you know

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,560
some big universities have eight up to

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,600
16 or whatever different laboratories or

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,600
departments

00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,120
and and you know you start one one of

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,240
them but then the other guys get key and

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,399
then you suddenly have

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,279
you know critical mass and everybody's

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,120
very happy because

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,639
we're complying all over the university

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,720
which would be brilliant

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,079
okay so here again we're going a little

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,720
bit agile we've got some sprints and

00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,759
some some

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,000
iterations um apart from just defining

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,320
what the competent center should do

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,360
um i think there are three main ones so

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,399
the first thing is setting up an

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,240
infrastructure

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,320
it's really important to have the tools

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,920
to do this um it's very difficult to

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,279
look at source code if you don't

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,399
have a git type repository so that needs

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,920
to be defined

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,680
it's very difficult to store anything

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,079
unless you've got long-term storage

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,600
um processes set up okay and there are

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,519
lots of tools out there to do this

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,160
there's scanners there's code scanners

00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:08,240
there's software 360 for storing the the

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,079
information so setting up the

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,320
infrastructure to make it easy

00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,600
and to automate a lot of this is really

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,120
important

00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,440
um the second action line we're working

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,000
is new pilots so we're working

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,600
bottom up we're gonna you know we're

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,120
basically seeding the idea

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,519
in the small research groups the bigger

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,639
research groups that they need to do

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,320
some compliance work and um hopefully

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,839
they will chat about it over lunch well

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,160
you don't have lunch these days together

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,440
but when when you do get together again

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,880
they'll talk about it over lunch and

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,199
think it's a good idea

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,040
and then from one project it'll it'll

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,800
spin over to another project and

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,519
hopefully we get some again critical

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,680
mass so that so that the idea gets

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,519
gets adopted and said let's do that and

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,920
part of normal best practice

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,360
okay and i think the third area we're

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,079
working on is community

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,000
i think that's really important um the

00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,519
moment a lot of research is done there's

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,800
a big research community and they feel

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,639
they are a member of a community

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,920
but it's a scientific community about

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,439
the areas of science where they're

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,959
working

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,319
it's not a open source community so

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,120
um i think what we're trying to build

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,959
here is is this

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,400
get the skills and the knowledge into a

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,480
minimum of people who are

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,520
who like the idea and who can help each

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,520
other out

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:25,199
and so that um the competence center is

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:27,439
not that you know not the single

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,360
source of all information and know-how

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,039
but it's a community of people who can

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,640
help each other

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,039
setting up the usual community disk you

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,919
know discussion lists um slack channels

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,880
ircs whatever the developers use to

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,880
communicate

00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,559
uh and and have you know online or

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,360
offline events together

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,520
um around this concept and that that's

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,039
really important for sustainability

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,559
because we can go in and we can work for

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:55,200
six months but if

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,200
um if the the um

00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,720
we leave and we know we leave this

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,160
conference center and they have the

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,200
staff they do it

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,960
unless we've achieved um

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,400
the community it's not going to stay

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,440
because researchers come and go you know

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,520
over four years

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,840
you probably there's probably rotation

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,160
about 20 25 percent if not more

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,440
of the the junior staff the senior staff

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,200
tend to stay

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:19,520
um and that's difficult because it means

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,440
onboarding it means bringing people in

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,200
means bringing people luckily

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,559
universities are producing

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,240
software engineers developers and

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,160
scientists who are

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,720
becoming more and more aware of open

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:33,760
source and license requirements

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,480
but um anyway if we have this community

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,280
if we have the

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,080
events set up you have the the community

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,919
dynamics

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,440
then we're hoping that this will be

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,960
sustainable and and that the

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,160
certification because there is an open

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,280
source certification

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,880
can be achieved year after year because

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,480
they've achieved the right amount of

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,640
quality okay

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,600
so where are we now um just to conclude

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,520
and and

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,520
i hope i haven't gone too fast through

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,640
all of this um

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,240
well we're setting up the competence

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,120
center as i said we're defining the

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,799
materials

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,799
and the processes we're working with the

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,559
developers we're going to go into at

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,440
least another three if not four

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,799
projects and do the homework for them so

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,200
we're going to act as if we are doing

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,440
the

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,480
the compliance for them but the idea is

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,760
in the next batch

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,520
which will be the second three-month

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,440
period um

00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:21,600
we'll be guiding the researchers

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,200
themselves to do the compliance work you

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,039
know to scanning their code

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,679
ensuring that all the licenses are there

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:29,919
making it working on the

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,720
copyleft incompatibilities taking

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,640
decisions about

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,919
licensing and what type of license do we

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,720
want to use

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,520
and do we want to free this you know and

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,400
matching

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,600
the code we have with whatever tech

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,520
transfer

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:46,960
uh um you know channel has been decided

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,400
you know this is private licensing

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:53,679
is open source is this uh whatever

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,600
okay so um that that's important

00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,200
another area is is that obviously this

00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,720
is to do with ip management it's not

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,400
just open source management it's all

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,799
intellectual property uh which includes

00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,840
patents unfortunately in the software

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,000
so um what we're looking at is

00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:10,000
integrating

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,400
these open chain style processes

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,360
for quality into the general ip

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,760
management

00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,280
so i mean you know you have to you still

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,240
have to know who wrote the code and how

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,039
it was written

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,120
and with whom um and under what contract

00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,600
if it's if it's a you know age 2020

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,880
development grant or something um you

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,760
still need to know that so open source

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,400
just falls in

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,360
it's another leg of good project

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,799
management

00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,840
okay um also it's important to actually

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,600
understand

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,840
what the different universities are

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:41,679
capable of um some of them

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,880
have the resources have a central i.t

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,520
department who are really keen on

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,240
setting up

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,799
they even have a git uh instance or

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,760
whatever

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:50,480
you know they've got they've got the

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:51,440
capacities others uh specifically in

00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,840
social sciences

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,039
uh who also do actually use a lot of

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,000
open source

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:58,400
um don't have any infrastructure at all

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,960
so

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,679
or have very little so it's important uh

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,360
to be to be able to get them on board

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,740
and and have the infrastructures for

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,200
them okay

00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,080
[Music]

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,600
also what we're trying to do is to match

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,840
all this work into

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,200
the open science initiatives i think

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,679
this is a very big

00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,799
and important topic it's a bit late i

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,760
think this should have been done 15

00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:24,240
years ago

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,120
but uh open science is now a big topic a

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,520
big big

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,320
big buzzword if not fashionable but i

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,120
think it's

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,720
it's a very good thing in sense of

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,520
access to know how

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,159
fair on data f-a-i-r i think should

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,760
f-a-r

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,840
on code as well we should be thinking

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,480
about that you know um

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,000
and uh there's some great initiatives on

00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,480
uh conservatories

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,320
for open source code there's some

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,120
there's a lot of

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,720
thought about collaborative research and

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,559
open collaborative research

00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,320
and that is absolutely matching the

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,640
philosophy and the

00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,400
dynamics of open source as a software

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,320
development movement

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,159
so i think the the open source can bring

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,799
a lot to the open science initiative

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,520
and vice versa okay so that's really

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,480
important

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,240
and just finally um what you know

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,559
looking at what our challenges are

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,520
um getting institutional support is not

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,679
difficult at least

00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,840
not at the research level the university

00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,480
itself sees this as a little bit of

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,440
um you know time that they don't have to

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,120
dedicate to this

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,640
but but usually you know with as i said

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,600
with open science nearly all

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,240
universities are

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,360
i think all of them are in favor and so

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,039
it's difficult to say

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,559
i'm in favor of open science but i'm not

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,039
in favor of open source

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,559
that that would be totally inconsistent

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,880
so so that's good

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:41,760
um motivating the researchers is the

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,000
most difficult one

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,880
and and the unfortunate thing is in

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,960
times of the

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,960
the the covet we don't have pizza

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,080
parties beer free beers

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,720
you know meetups anything um i've done

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,760
this before

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,240
before the pandemic and and just getting

00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:01,360
people to have a cup of coffee or a beer

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,159
together um and chat about this is is

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,200
actually

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,960
worth hours of seminar in our way

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,480
so hopefully when all this is over we

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,400
can we can go back to being normal human

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,799
beings and being social

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,559
and use social dynamics to to get this

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,919
um transferred around and people

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:19,200
motivated

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:21,360
um transfer skills is not a problem here

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,880
because these people researchers are

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,679
really keen to learn they've got big

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,200
brains

00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:28,400
they they just take it on board as

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:31,440
another step in their research projects

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:34,000
um and and the the difficulty here is to

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,640
well the the only trick is to make these

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,679
skills

00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,159
seem interesting sexy important um

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,000
valuable for their curriculum to get so

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,279
so so that when if they want to transfer

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
or they want to go from being a

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,640
researcher

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,400
to industry um they've got skills on

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,440
their curriculum which are important and

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,159
they can highlight those

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,200
so that's good um and as i said a little

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,400
bit before

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,720
uh working top down in open source is

00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,480
just

00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,919
is hopeless there's no point i've done

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,880
we've tried to do it in public sector it

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,480
doesn't work

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,240
you've got to be bottom up so this is

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,120
why we're starting in one department

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,679
in a few pilot groups and going up and

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,360
the idea

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:14,400
is to to see the revolution um and then

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,320
with some cross-pollination we we

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,840
get into some other research department

00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,360
social scientists we get into

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,240
biochemistry we get into the medical

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,240
department

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,240
where there's lots of open source going

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,640
on lots more than people think

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,159
um and open even more open data and they

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,960
have to have the same practices for open

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,760
data

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,360
as you have for open source code anyway

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,799
so that's where we are

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,480
and that's what i really wanted to say

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,440
um just to show that you know things are

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,679
happening

00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:40,559
and um i think university which is one

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,600
of the areas where

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:47,039
a lot of open source is produced

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:49,360
um if they can get on board and produce

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,480
legally quality open source then we're

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,240
going to be much easier

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,159
and a lot of the code on git is in

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,360
github is going to have a license

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,360
and that's it thank you very much

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,039
thank you malcolm thank you very much

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,960
and um yeah it's great to hear that so

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:07,279
much is going on under the radar

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:10,320
in the academic sphere and uh getting

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:12,640
funding presumably to contribute to

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,080
i live in spain funding is like a

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,520
strange word that we don't really know

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,039
about

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,480
in germany there's plenty of it but it's

00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,360
um yeah it comes with a lot of strings

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,880
attached right there

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:26,320
but anyway to the questions uh

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:28,320
i'm looking again at um uh venulis

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,520
and those who want to ask questions

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,279
please put them in the chat

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:33,279
in the meanwhile i'll put some questions

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,360
that came to my mind

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,640
um yeah first off how can we sign up for

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,760
your newsletter because you said that's

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,200
one of the things that you're going to

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,400
be producing from the competence letter

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,840
sorry the competence center is there

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,880
somewhere we can already sign up for

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,559
early access

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,240
no you're not yet not yet it's next week

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,840
we're speaking with the communication

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,279
people that's a great thing we're doing

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,559
kind of like bonding with the other

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,679
departments at the university

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:52,960
and the communication people are

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,320
important because they do internal and

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,080
external communication

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,520
so yes but there's there's a newsletter

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,080
there's a newsletter on open chain the

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,960
one you should sign up is go on to

00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:05,360
openchainproject.org and sign up for the

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,039
the the newsletters and open chain

00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,279
there's a lot going on there and

00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,240
it's really quality work uh with some

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,520
great people

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,039
um who are actually speaking at the

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,600
conference as well so um you know shane

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,360
cochran

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,960
miriam bahasa there's some great people

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,440
there who are doing a lot of work

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,960
fantastic fantastic i'll do that and

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,559
again about the competence center it

00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,159
sounds very exciting i'm wondering how

00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,000
it's funded is it a pro bono

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,080
project how does it fit with your work

00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,679
or the others of the other experts who

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,360
are contributing to this

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,120
um no well the competence is actually in

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,799
the university so it's it's funded by

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,559
the university within the budget of

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,640
probably of the tech transfer office

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,159
that's outside my area of knowledge of

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,159
where where the money comes from

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,600
um yes i get funded for my advisory

00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,760
services um

00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,120
and the whole point is to do knowledge

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,520
transfer so that the

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,919
by the end of this year uh that the

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,320
competency is up and running by itself

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,000
so

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,919
and the funding the funding yes there is

00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,480
funding there's quite a lot of funding

00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,080
coming from public administrations for

00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,360
quality and research and they're putting

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,159
open source compliance as part of

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,400
quality

00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:05,520
okay and there's funding in catalonia

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,440
than the petr

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:08,559
peter projects there's funding in the

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,880
european union

00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,640
um and probably from the other uh

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,080
entities for this concept of quality and

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,760
open science so that's where i'd look

00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,880
for budget

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,799
that's very interesting and speaking to

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,799
quality so i understood i think the

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,039
point about

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,640
quality in terms of the software being

00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:26,080
more discoverable

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,080
more reusable more likely to be

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,080
incorporated into other projects

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,520
but about the reproducibility of

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,360
research that you mentioned

00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,880
how is that affected by the compliance

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,000
work that you and the competence center

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,840
are going to be doing

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,200
well if you've got code which is not

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,480
legal because you're not complying with

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,679
the licenses you're not entitled to

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,840
reproduce it

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,039
it's as simple as that you can download

00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,240
it and do what you want illegally

00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,520
because if it's not complying with the

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,360
copyleft licenses

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,200
it hasn't got the copyright notices

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,039
boring stuff that lawyers deal with but

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,480
actually the bread and butter of making

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:56,960
open source work um you can't reproduce

00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,480
it because

00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,919
you can't transfer if you can't transfer

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,559
then nobody else can check it out

00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,480
whether that code actually works

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:06,480
so that would i mean that would actually

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,840
be a practical problem the researchers

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,360
even if they're just downloading

00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,360
software for their own machine and then

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:15,039
they produce a research paper

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:17,120
or or yes they'd make some discovery or

00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,320
that questions might be asked about the

00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,919
software they were using and whether

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,880
they had licenses to use it in the first

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,120
place

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,799
yeah a little bit i think that as i said

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,559
they live in a little bubble where

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,840
people don't really ask those questions

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:29,760
and the trouble is when you take when

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,080
you transfer out to industry and you've

00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,520
got

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,200
banks who are taking this up or

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,760
automotive or

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,520
you know pharma they're going to ask

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,039
difficult questions

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,720
they say well can i use this how can i

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,080
use this can i build on this can i

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,720
transfer this to someone else can i sell

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,240
it

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,159
and if they suddenly see oh this is full

00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,200
of copyless stuff which is great for the

00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,640
community

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,320
but industry is still a little bit

00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,080
reluctant to to

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,520
working with copyleft or they don't know

00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:56,000
how to unfortunately

00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,960
so so um that that's where the kind of

00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,520
headaches

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,799
can come from yeah that's great and uh

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,520
that's a big issue

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,720
um i've seen as well um and so about the

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,159
certificates you mentioned some

00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,600
compliance certificates that sounds like

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,000
a potentially interesting

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,799
concept that could have uh yeah wider

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,399
application

00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,399
has there been much thought put to that

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,320
yet or is it just yeah well it's it's

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:17,919
part of the open chain process um it's

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,919
self-certification

00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,960
so so um if you go on the open chain

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,720
project site

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,720
um there's all the information there to

00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,720
actually come into compliance with the

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,559
specification so you can build your own

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,559
process and everything and at the end

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,080
there's kind of a certification

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:34,240
questionnaire where you take all the

00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,279
right boxes and you say guys i'm

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,480
i'm you know i'm compliant so it's a

00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,760
little bit informal as you said it's

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,799
self-certification

00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:45,919
now that we are an iso a formal iso

00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:47,600
standard um i'm sure that it may move to

00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,880
a more formalized thing that some

00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,720
third-party

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:55,360
auditor or qualified um standards um

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,440
verify whatever can can give us their

00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,880
official seal of approval or whatever

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,240
but i mean for the moment we're working

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,840
open source we do our things ourselves

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,240
and we do you know we trust

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,600
so and transparency provides trust you

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,120
know helps trust

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,640
so so yeah but the certification

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:09,440
scheme's there and you can you can read

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,640
the questionnaire

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,159
and if you tick all the boxes you can

00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,520
say you can go and put your logo on the

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:17,679
website and say hey i'm

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:20,159
i'm the next one who's compliant

00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:21,279
yeah absolutely and uh has there been

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,279
any thought put to

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,559
campaigns around raising awareness of

00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,919
the work that the the compliance center

00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,039
will be doing i know it's early on and

00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,760
you're getting your publications up and

00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,640
running but

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,960
you know there seems to be some

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,520
overlapping for example uh other ngos in

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,919
the field

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,679
uh fsp or uh you know open source

00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,240
initiative yeah well i mean fsp and open

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,399
source

00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,480
have been with open chain for a long

00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,799
time linux foundation is it's it's it's

00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,440
now

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,039
uh hosted the linux foundation um and

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,559
there's lots of noise about that if you

00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,000
just look up open chain project

00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,000
and open source and you'll find that

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,360
there's shane cochlear is is is the

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,080
greatest communicator in the world just

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,880
about

00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,679
um so so on open gen itself yes there's

00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,760
lots of noise

00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,440
in open chain in university no this is

00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:02,240
the first project i know about so

00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,440
so so we're not we're now next week when

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,000
we speak to the communications

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,360
guy and girl she she will be telling us

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,399
when and how

00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,880
how we can communicate this um uh i

00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,080
think

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,080
we won't be able to do it until the

00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,840
summer but we'll get we'll get out there

00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,120
we'll be writing some stuff about this

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,720
i imagine students would be a very

00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:20,240
receptive audience for for all sorts of

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,200
reasons so i hope that the outreach

00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,519
there is successful

00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,880
over time yeah we may have an exam we

00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,279
should have an open-chain exam just to

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,440
make that safe

00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,399
be part of the grant application process

00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:47,840
exactly

00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:47,840
exactly that's great thank you so much

00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,440
