Title: #FOSSBack: Tobie Langel - Towards a sustainable solution to open source sustainability
Publication date: 2021-02-23
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	A few years ago, Heartbleed epitomized a massive open source sustainability problem for critical parts of the internet infrastructure. The bug, which affected the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library, notably compromised the confidentiality of 4.5 million US patient records and cost the industry an estimated $500M.

It was soon revealed that the root-cause of the issue was that OpenSSL was precariously understaffed. Open source sustainability became a major theme overnight. Stories of maintainer burn-out made the headlines. And tentative solutions started to emerge, most of them donation-based.

In this talk we’ll explore a number of existing strategies to fund open source and make it more sustainable, from patronage to dedicated ad networks. And we’ll defend the idea that the best path to open source sustainability is to help companies understand the tangible business value they can get from contributing to open source.

	00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,080
all right

00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:11,280
so um welcome let me start by asking you

00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:15,200
um if any of you actually still

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:18,320
uh recognize um this logo here

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:22,560
and this of course is on the logo

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:26,000
of the heartblade bug

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,160
and the heartblade bug as

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,080
some of you probably remember was a

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,719
critical vulnerability that affected the

00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,719
openssl library in 2014

00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,719
and of course openssl is this library

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,879
that is responsible for securing network

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,960
communications and unix systems

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:45,520
and as a result um power is essentially

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,879
on privacy and security in the majority

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,520
of internet servers

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,079
and so um this bug actually had a

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,719
massive

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,000
impact notably and that's not the only

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,879
thing that happened but it

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,079
um essentially broke the confidentiality

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,199
the confidentiality

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:04,400
of um about four and a half

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:07,360
point five million uh patient records

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,320
of u.s citizens and the industry

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,600
estimated that its

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,000
impact the cost of its work of of the

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,280
bug

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,119
sorry costed the industry about half

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,960
a billion dollars so i'm going to be

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,600
speaking a lot about money in this talk

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,799
today

00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,280
um essentially because well money is at

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,640
the

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,640
the heart of um of sustainability

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,000
um to do to well at least two to some

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,520
degree and

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,040
so the heartbeat bug is really

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,640
interesting because it's sort of a

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,200
pivotal moment

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,159
where the tech industry suddenly

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,360
realizes that

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,880
open source is ubiquitous right so

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,439
um two-thirds of active websites in 2014

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,520
relied on the openssl library to encrypt

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:53,200
the its communications

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,720
also critical um openssl

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,719
you know was something that enabled

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,520
private communications bank transactions

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,640
uh storing medical records safely uh end

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,640
to end encryption

00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,399
in all of these aspects so it wasn't

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,360
just like you know a nice

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,239
fun client-side library to add animation

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,720
to your website

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,520
it was really core to how the internet

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,760
functioned

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,599
and then of course the last bit is this

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,440
is when the industry realized that not

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,319
only was this ubiquitous and critical

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,000
but also open source was critically

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,879
underfunded and that this

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,959
underfunding was at the heart of the

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,520
existence of this bug in the first place

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,640
and to give you an um concretely what

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,760
that meant

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,080
it's open ssl who was essentially

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,280
protecting two two-thirds of internet

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,920
communication

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,640
um was maintained by one full-time

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,440
maintainer

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,800
on the budget of two thousand dollars a

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,959
year

00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:52,000
and so um this um essentially

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:56,319
pushed the industry as a whole

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,040
to realize the extent of

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,319
the sustainability problem that it had

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,760
and this is when we started

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,519
really hearing about the question of

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,480
maintainer burnout for example

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:08,480
um and really this opened oh sorry this

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,040
really opened the floodgates right

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,080
uh people in the industry the community

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,080
the maintainers

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,120
the contributors really started speaking

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,680
up about these

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,640
issues of sustainability and

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,080
sustainability

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:25,280
really took center stage and as a result

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,640
rather quickly we had multiple

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,040
uh responses or response attempts

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,720
um by different actors in the field and

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,519
those and was a really broad

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,560
set of responses and so in the first

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,319
part of this

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,239
talk what i really want to do is sort of

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,200
like cover a bit of the ground

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,519
that exists and sort of like as a result

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,280
of

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:50,400
this or rather that this 2014

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,280
uh heartblade bug sort of like uh

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,400
um accelerated right to look at these

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,080
different options

00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,080
and then sort of propose a broader um

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,640
additional way to consider open source

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,799
sustainability in the future

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,760
so let's get started um one of the

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,840
immediate first

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,159
response of the industry was to create

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,720
the core infrastructure initiative

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,319
and this was an industry-wide effort

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,280
organized by the linux foundation and

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,600
backed by pretty much

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,720
all of the big tech corporations in the

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,720
world

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,479
was a multi-million dollar fund

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,240
administered by the linux foundation and

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,360
a steering committee of industry experts

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,759
around security

00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,000
and its goal was really to harden the

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:33,040
security of key open source projects

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,160
so the focus was really let's make sure

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,000
that the open source key infrastructure

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,040
that we all rely on

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,600
um is sustainable secure

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,680
and we don't bump into issues like

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,919
heartblade again

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:53,440
um but of course at at this point um

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:56,720
we the the whole community was really

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,800
sort of bought into this idea of um

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,720
well we have a systematic sustainability

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,199
problem and we need to sort of fix it

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,320
and so maintainers developers open

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,080
source developers trying

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,759
tried to find solutions of their own

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,080
um one of um the the first um

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,800
thing that happened is people used

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,800
existing

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,320
platforms that had been designed for

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,960
other things like patreon

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:23,360
right um and sort of and tried to

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,320
leverage patreon or other others

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,520
like well-minded platforms um to

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,759
essentially fund

00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:32,080
open source development and so of course

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,800
the the initial goal of patreon was

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,400
um to to help artists musicians and

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,360
writers create a meaningful revenue

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,000
stream

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,960
um and this sort of like was adapted to

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,880
open source and

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,000
actually quite successfully by some

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,039
players um

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,800
in the field notably avenue was pictured

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,919
here the creator of ujs

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,400
who um at that time was able to uh turn

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,000
over

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:59,440
17 000 per month which

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,880
was enough for for him to focus fully

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,919
uh full time on on unview.js

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,280
of course um the question arises as to

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:10,800
whether this is a

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:13,759
reproducible um solution and in fact

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,960
um it hasn't really been proven to be

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,000
reproducible on

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,280
large scale right so some um

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,479
a few well-known developers were able to

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,199
sort of create this

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,680
and build a large enough revenue stream

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,600
to be

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,039
able to work in open source full-time

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,039
but this really wasn't common

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:40,479
so sorry another

00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,080
approach was um um is what git coin

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,720
created and there is

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,360
uh a lot more interest today again uh

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,960
about

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,319
blockchain-based solutions to sort of

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,120
um create um shared revenue amongst

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,680
users

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,720
uh um and creators of open source i'm

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,440
generally kind of

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,639
um dubious about um the idea and how

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,800
this works

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,680
also because i i have my own personal

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,919
doubts about

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,800
the uh the underlying um ideology behind

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,680
blockchain which

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,039
i tend to think is very libertarian uh

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,039
but nonetheless i think there are

00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,160
interesting efforts in that space and

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,240
it's really worth

00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,919
um having a look at them and trying to

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,240
to see what this this whole

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,000
culture is looking at and so get coin

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,039
was uh particularly interesting because

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,199
it essentially created

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:29,520
um well first of all because it was a

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,160
whole ecosystem and it still is

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,919
um so it was get coined but also an ad

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,440
network that now is defunct

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,080
and sort of a patron-like solution

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,639
called grants um and so the idea of

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,800
github

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,240
um of bitcoin was to create a github

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,759
issue market where

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,440
uh people who needed um uh

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,280
contributions to open source software

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,840
would have bounties

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,879
and developers would um be paid for the

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,000
work that they did

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:59,919
and so in 2018 it spent about half a

00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:03,520
um a million dollar um

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,520
paying out bounties to developers

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,879
it also created code fund which was

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,919
essentially sort of like a way to

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,479
advertise

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,639
specifically to open source developers

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,759
and really focused on

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,160
um hiring and so that that got closed it

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,479
wasn't very um it wasn't sustainable

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,120
uh-huh uh and it was now sort of

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,520
replaced and endorsed by code fund uh

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,039
the replacement is ethical ads which is

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,080
has a similar origin story

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:33,200
essentially trying to build um

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,039
make open source sustainable and really

00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,560
started being really developer focused

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,519
um and trying to

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,039
advertise to developers so jobs but also

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,680
sas software et cetera

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,200
um and it has served a billion ads since

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,880
2016 probably more

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:52,160
um today um but you know still

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:55,360
a billion ads is large but it's also

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:59,120
not a huge amount of money overall

00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,120
um we're now seeing more and more of um

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,040
essentially so this is oss capital so

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,920
essentially venture-backed open source

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,640
startups

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,440
again here i have my own personal view

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,720
on like

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,160
how uh really um open source these are

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,399
and and how much they're actually trying

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,560
to solve the overall and underlying

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,360
problem of open source sustainability

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,480
but it's also uh an effort that is

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,720
happening there's a lot more

00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,600
vc capital being invested injected in

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,240
open source

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,279
and that's also interesting to follow of

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,560
course um

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,040
on this wouldn't be complete without

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,959
looking also at open collective

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,640
which essentially provides non-profit

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,800
status to open source projects and

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,760
transparency as to how those funds are

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,920
used

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,440
huge success story is webpack which is

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,040
making now i think close to half a

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,360
million dollars a year

00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,200
um and which created some really a

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,279
win-win situation for key sponsors like

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,839
trivago have spoken about this and

00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,720
other contexts before uh happy to chat

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,360
about it um

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,440
after this talk um but of course the the

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,519
problem of open collective here too

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,800
is the long-tail problem right key

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,560
projects are

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,000
uh getting most of the funding so for

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,839
example webpack was a

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,160
quarter of the total funds that were

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:11,200
given out in in 2017

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,839
and so the dependencies itself is is not

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,120
really

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,120
the dependencies of like the key

00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,600
projects aren't really funded

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,800
which is why um open collective has

00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,959
started back your start

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,000
stack project which is essentially

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,480
helping you

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
a consumer of open source figuring out

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,760
not only the projects that you use but

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,480
the whole dependency tree of those

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,240
projects

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,720
and then being able to fund that whole

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,760
dependency tree accordingly

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,920
um which um incidentally is also

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,680
uh very similar to the model that

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,160
tidelift has created

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,720
um where um it's trying to essentially

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,720
build

00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,000
a red hat business model for the long

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,519
tail um

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,920
so providing security updates

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,320
maintenance and legal asserts that um

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,519
for essentially your whole open source

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,200
stack

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:59,200
and it's doing so by actually paying

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,320
the actual maintainers of the of the

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,800
projects

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,360
um and so the actual success of tight

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,680
lift is

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,720
is still to be proven in the long term

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,760
but it's also

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,399
a really interesting model so i sort of

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,240
gave you

00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:18,320
this um you know this um exciting

00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,839
um view of all of these different

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,360
projects that are trying to solve that

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,480
problem but i also

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,360
want us to look at uh the the downsides

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,959
and

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,399
of that and for this we're going to look

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:33,040
at four questions right

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:35,360
the question is does this funding based

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,040
solution to open source sustainability

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,320
actually scale

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,480
um is money really the key question um

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:45,680
and even if money was the key question

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,360
is um um funding open source that way

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,519
with open source developers on one side

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,560
and a regular developers on the other

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:54,399
a desirable outcome and lastly i want to

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,200
focus on what the real value of open

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,440
source is

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,120
and make you reconsider the idea that

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,240
we're essentially trying to

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,959
um find a way to fund the open source

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,600
uh the code itself and really consider

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,480
about

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,120
more the value of community and of the

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,200
knowledge

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,399
and network that's built inside of

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,480
community

00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,000
so let's look at this at scale first um

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:20,000
and for this i'm going to

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,480
use um this absolutely great um diagram

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,760
from

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,000
demonic acres demonocracy.info which i'm

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,279
using

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,160
was permission and um which i think

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,760
really shows the size of the problem

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,160
that we're facing when we're trying to

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,240
fund

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,839
open source uh through essentially

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,200
charity based funding like we've been

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,079
looking at so far

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,200
um so this is a hundred dollar bill if

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:44,560
you stack

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,880
100 of those you get 10 000 and this was

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,279
the monthly revenue of code fund the

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,160
advertiser that we talked about now if

00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:53,440
you pack

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:56,480
a hundred of those uh dollar pack of

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,120
those uh ten ten thousand dollars a pack

00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,760
you get one million dollar right and

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,880
this

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,000
um is uh the amount that was collected

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,720
by open collective

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
in 2018 i think and it's the amount that

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,639
tide left committed to pay developers

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,480
uh out of the money it received from its

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,800
vc funding

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,959
now if we do some quick a back of the

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,399
envelope math we realized quickly that

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,200
the worldwide develop developer

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,959
population

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,920
is actually substantial right we're

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:28,480
looking uh in 2018 as roughly

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,839
um 20 million developers and if we do

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,200
math for this

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:36,320
um and estimating that a developer

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:40,079
costs roughly 65 000 in the world

00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,639
um on average uh we get to a total

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,199
cost of paying developers in the world

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,560
that is

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:48,399
one trillion dollars right so i want to

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,839
sort of compare this notion of one

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,320
million dollars which is

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,440
roughly you know in the vicinity of what

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,920
we're paying out

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,680
to open source to fund open source or

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,839
you know in the millions of dollars

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,040
to what we're actually paying as an

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,079
industry in

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:07,600
um wages to developers worldwide

00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:10,720
so if you take um if you stack um

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,399
uh you know if you create a stack

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,320
on a wooden pallet of 100 million

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,760
dollars that's what it looks like right

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,040
um now if you get 10 of those you get to

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,480
1 billion

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,720
dollars and now to get

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,760
to 10 billion dollars you're making a a

00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:29,839
square of

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:33,440
10 by 10 pallets of um

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,480
um um what was it a hundred million

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,519
dollars each

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,680
um and if you actually want to get to a

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:43,040
trillion dollar well you have to stack

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:46,800
a hundred of those and it gives you

00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:49,360
a tower of bills of dollar bill of 100

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,839
bills of the size of a huge skyscraper

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,680
right

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,760
so to compare here's your one million

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,680
dollar down there and here's you you're

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,480
trying your trillion dollar right

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,519
so the the discrepancy between what

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,360
we're trying to spend

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,160
and the size of the problem means that

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,880
it really is hard to make scale

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,639
so the second question is is money

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,279
really what's missing and the answer to

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,040
that is

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,959
actually um in

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,399
nuanced right so for example it depends

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,680
on the project obviously but for a

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,160
number of projects

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,160
um for example here the linux kernel

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,519
most contributors to the next kernel are

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,079
actually employed

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,000
to work on the linux kernel so the

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,680
question of sustainability here doesn't

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,399
really is it the question isn't really

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,120
are people

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:36,480
paid or not it's are people given enough

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:40,000
time to work on critical infrastructure

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:43,120
um the um third question

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,160
and i think this is a key one is is

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,199
it really a desirable outcome to have

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,120
on one side charity funded open source

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,880
developers and on the other

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,480
corporate developers or developers

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,720
working for agencies which are

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,279
essentially writing glue code

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,600
um to combine all of the software that's

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:05,040
built elsewhere

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,360
and for that i want to quote um dhh

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,800
which

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:11,040
wrote in 2013 the following

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,399
part of the reason much of open source

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,320
is so good and

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,440
often so superior to closed source

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,240
commercial projects

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,000
is the natural boundary of constraints

00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,759
if you're not being paid or otherwise

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,440
compensated directly for your work

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,680
you're less likely to needlessly

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,240
embellish it you're solving the problems

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,160
for you

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,000
and your mates likely in the simplest

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,680
way you could so you can get back to

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,160
whatever you originally intended to do

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,959
before

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,440
starting to shave the yak so what dhh is

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:40,320
saying here is

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,920
um the fact that open source is created

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,440
by developers that are

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:48,399
actually building real applications

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:50,160
um is uh important it creates open

00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,560
source that is of better quality

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,320
because it really solves the real

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,360
problem that the community or that

00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:00,160
they're trying to solve and isn't trying

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:03,519
to become a product that's attractive

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,679
um and that wants um to be bought

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,959
right so i think that this notion that

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,160
there's value

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:13,199
in really um having developers

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:17,679
contribute to open source i think um um

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:19,280
is a really important one and lastly

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,760
i really want to look at the question of

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,559
the real value of open source

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,360
and insist on the fact that it is beyond

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,319
time for us

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,840
as an industry to look uh beyond the

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,840
value of opens

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,520
of the code itself and really look at

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,160
the broader picture of what open source

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,640
is

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,799
um and essentially as open source in

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,480
terms of the community of practice

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:44,960
and a culture and a set of

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,480
ways to develop software and not just a

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,000
code itself

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,080
and for this i'm just going to sort of

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,360
like close this uh

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:55,200
talk with this um diagram

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,600
which sort of like explains the way

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,120
we're look generally tend to look at the

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,520
problem of sustainability

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,320
in open source from a corporate uh point

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,880
of view

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,960
and essentially what we have here is on

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,280
on you know on the left corporations

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,200
in on the right sort of like open source

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,880
and open sources represented by a pool

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,600
of commons in which the software is

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,360
swimming

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,960
and by sort of like the mythical

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,600
creatures around it which are

00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,200
open source developers and so the way we

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,600
look at this is essentially

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,240
corporations just use that open source

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,160
software

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,679
right and when there are problems with

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,120
open source software it's not

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,880
you know good enough or there are

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,400
security issues um

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,160
the default mode of trying to fix the

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,480
problem is to throw money at it

00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,840
right which is you know very much how a

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,440
silicon valley industry

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,720
sort of of things is like let's throw

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,080
money in the problem and see if that

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,919
helps the problem disappear

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,440
and so the idea behind this of course is

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:49,600
by throwing money at the problem this is

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,520
going to instantiate incentivize

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,880
open source developers to contribute to

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,360
the pool of commons and

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,640
as a result the corporations will be

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,760
able to

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,840
um benefit from the perceived value the

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,760
source code of open source

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,520
and in reality what's really important

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,080
to understand is that

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,799
the the real value of open source and

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,760
there's like

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,520
you know increasingly um research that

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,520
tends to prove and show this

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,440
is not so much in the code that's being

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,039
produced uh because that code is

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,720
essentially free to use right it's

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,960
completely commoditized

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,080
and so that that's not really where you

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,799
can capture value

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,200
no where you can create encounter value

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,400
is

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:33,600
in how the practice of open source

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,720
makes your your company

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,240
faster more agile how it builds a

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,080
network of relationships

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,760
across different teams and different

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,280
corporations um

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:47,120
how it helps your developers um

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,559
level up increase their knowledge

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,559
increase their network

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,080
uh increase their understanding of the

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,760
underlying technology on which you're

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,320
building your own software et cetera

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,600
right

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,799
and so the truth is that the real value

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:02,880
of open source

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:06,240
um is really um what those developers

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:09,280
take back home um to their own company

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:12,320
as a result of being contributing to

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,120
um this um pool of commons and as a

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,760
result of being

00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,640
part of this community in with whom they

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,320
interact

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,159
and with whom they they actually create

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,440
software and so

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,360
we need to really stop looking at

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,960
corporations as this um

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,400
solid entity and really think that the

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,520
corporation is actually

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,840
fill full of people that can

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,520
also themselves be contributors that so

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,559
that instead of like throwing money at

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,600
the problem

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:39,600
you essentially throw people

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,960
that can participate in the underlying

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,159
community and

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:47,440
um as a result uh benefit

00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:50,080
from um the same networking relationship

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,120
building effects um of participating in

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,919
the community

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,440
and bring back that value to the

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,080
corporations

00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,880
and so essentially um what i'm here to

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,840
say is

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,679
although charity-like funding is um

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,159
going to be useful in some scenarios

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,440
that is

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:08,400
valuable to the community it's not alone

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,640
by itself

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,960
on the solution and the real way forward

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,559
really is to normalize engineers

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,640
contributing to open source

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,720
as part of their day job and the

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,679
question of course is how do we do this

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,200
um and to me the the key to that is

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,000
exactly how we got

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,280
corporations to use open source a decade

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,520
or two decades ago

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,559
it's to make them understand the return

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:34,480
on investment

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:36,000
of contributing to open source and

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,520
that's it thank you so much for

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,760
listening and i'm happy

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:41,760
to take your questions thank you very

00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,840
much

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,679
