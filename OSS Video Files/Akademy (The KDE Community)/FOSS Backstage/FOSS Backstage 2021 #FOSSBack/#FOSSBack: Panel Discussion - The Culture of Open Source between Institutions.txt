hello everyone

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,800
thank you so much for coming very

00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,559
excited to have you here for

00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,440
the culture of open source between

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:16,800
institutions with some amazing panelists

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,840
should be a good chat um

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,439
first off i have the honor of

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,199
sharing this session i suppose and

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,800
facilitating it so my name is richard

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:29,359
litauer i'm here on behalf of

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:31,359
moss labs i'm sustained and my own

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,480
many different hats which is very

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,680
exciting

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,360
um and what i've been doing

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,040
for the past few years really is trying

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,640
to build networks of people in open

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,719
source program offices

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,079
uh largely with moss labs through this

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,840
thing called ospo plus plus

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,600
which is a network of institutions

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,160
globally where people collaborate

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,440
together

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,360
at universities ngos cities governments

00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,920
and the like so we have some people here

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,719
from open source program offices at

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,320
institutions like those to talk about

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,920
how the culture of open source works at

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,080
those offices this is really exciting

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,600
it's for the time for ospos in general

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,960
um especially because of the ec

00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,400
commission's report recently where

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,200
they're calling for 20 osbo is being

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,200
made

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,119
we're seeing an explosion of osbos in

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,159
general so hope that we can learn a bit

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,439
more about what they are and how they

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,200
function and how to make sure that they

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:21,920
follow the spirit of open source

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:25,439
in this call so

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,920
to introduce our experts we're going to

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,079
after this short introduction talk about

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,040
what you do and what ospos mean to you

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,159
basically but for now for each of you

00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,720

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,159
could

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,960
where you are geo locationally and what

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,240
institution

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:47,680

after many years with the open source

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,840
programs office they're working on

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,320

basically open source and science the

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,800
emerging class of research

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,480
developers and frankly how the model of

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,040
scientific collaboration

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,440
and the model of open source

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,360
collaboration dovetail

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,680

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,959
are using and building open source and

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,400
one thing could be interesting for this

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,759
panel i've been working with

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,080
salando on um in a source topic

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,560
and help them to develop the open source

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,199
strategies and before that i also have a

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,160
few months

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,120
um working together with um damn

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,759
mercedes-benz

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,479
um on establishing their open source

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,479
strategies

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:45,520
yes from berlin germany

right now that would be so great

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,280
um somewhere else i wish i was but not

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,160
for the weather jonathan fink where are

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,280
you

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,759
hi i'm in vancouver british columbia

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,440
nice to see you all i'm a professor at

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,199
portland state university and university

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,840
of british columbia

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,440
and i'm here in part because i run a

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,000
smart city program

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,759
that includes portland vancouver and

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,160
seattle washington and so we're looking

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,000
at

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,919
kind of a regional perspective on some

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,240
of these issues and i'll also share a

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,880
few

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,680
thoughts from having been vice president

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,600
for research

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,759
at two universities for about 16 years

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,000
so hopefully oh listeners you can see we

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,600
have a pretty diverse panel today

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,800
a lot of different backgrounds coming

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,240
together so

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,759
it was kind of interesting planning this

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,800
because one of the things is well we

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,320
have to make sure everyone knows what an

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,919
open source program office is

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,600
but then how do you define it and every

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,960
single person you ask has a different

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,720
definition for

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,000
what it is and how it works and whether

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:47,120
it's a thing at all or whether it's

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,039
being open programs office etc etc

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,440
so we figured instead of defining it and

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,960
having me talk at all

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,720
we would ask each of you panelists

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,880
what does ospo mean for you what do you

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,240
do at your osbo how do you define it or

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,360
how have you defined it previously at

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,280
osbos you've worked at

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:08,800
also works well um and

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,360
where do you see them going so that's a

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,639
big

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,319
question yeah well we'll cover going

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,080
more later in the end so maybe just for

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,039
now what is an osbo to you at your

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,800
institution

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,160
and i think we should actually go around

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,199
and then maybe have a short discussion

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,319
afterwards where we share

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,800
what we've learned from each other while

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,319
we talked so cat went first last time so

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,600
to think jonathan fink why don't you go

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,919
first this time

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,960
sure well i would say of the six of us

00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,160
i'm the

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,560
least experienced with ospos and

00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,800
i'm working with a number of cities city

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,560
governments as well as universities all

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,120
of which are trying to figure out

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,919
how they fit into this because i'm in

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,720
portland

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,000
and and connected to seattle we have a

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,240
lot of large tech companies

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,160
so intel is the largest employer in

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,080
oregon they have a lot of experience

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,960
with this as does microsoft as does

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,880
amazon

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,400
and we have connections with them so in

00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,759
part we're learning from them but mostly

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,599
we're learning from the network that

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,039
richard represents and that he was

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:06,800
talking about earlier i think that what

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,160
the universities and the cities are

00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,120
trying to figure out is

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,400
what are the benefits to offset the

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,280
challenges of just getting this

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,000
organized

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,120
and telling administrators in both sets

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,479
of organizations

00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,800
here's something new that you should be

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,400
thinking about and worrying about

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,000
when you don't have any staff who are

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,880
going to make that necessarily your top

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,160
priority

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,080
so we've been learning quite a bit

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,039
already from particularly from johns

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,360
hopkins university in baltimore

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,199
and also from a few other cities that

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,720
are a little bit further on the path

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,720
than we are i love how you involve

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,720
cities as well right and ospos doesn't

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,039
just mean a large industry it could be

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,240
a network it could be connection and i

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,039
wouldn't say that you are less

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,720
experienced

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,240
um as you said you have 16 years of

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,840
experience in research and anything at

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,599
an administrative level going down

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,160
i'm talking too much josh what do i

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,759
suppose mean to you

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,199
uh so for me in ospo is uh

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,039
the open source programs office is an

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,520
interface for a company to the outside

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,199
world

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,960
to the to the rest of the open source

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,919
ecosystem um

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,680
and for me that means uh sort of inbound

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,680
and outbound relationships

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,919
helping to manage relationships open

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:20,000
sources really built on relationships

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,680
but then not just the the relationships

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,520
and outreach piece but

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,280
compliance security all the other things

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,560
that go with managing the use of open

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,840
source

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,120
that's uh that's kind of that's kind of

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,240
how i view an open source program's

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:35,839
office the interface for the world

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,519
i like that um

00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,200
what are you doing at tide lift you

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:40,560
would you say you run the ospo there i

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,919
mean i know it's an open source based

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,959
company

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,360
no no so so tide lift uh

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,000
i have worked in two ospos now i was

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,760
very

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,080
honored to call cat a colleague in

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,399
recent years at the google ospo and then

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,800
was at salesforce previously but now i'm

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:58,240
at a company that sells to osbos so

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,640
uh you know no pressure don't buy

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,720
anything um

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,560
no tidelift is is helping companies

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,800
manage the open source supply chain

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,560
and sort of helping with some of the

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,000
things that ospo's do

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,680
you kind of get into the weeds nitty

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,279
gritty and often you end up building

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,760
some custom tooling to manage this kind

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,040
of stuff

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,480
pride lift is trying to like help people

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,959
not reinvent the wheel in that way

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,519
and pay maintainers while at it

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,200
excellent

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,720
um thank you for explaining it's hard

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,240
when you have a non-traditional

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,080
ospo or non-traditional job you have a

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,000
lot of experience to say what's going on

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,839
stephen jacobs you definitely have a

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,959
very non-traditional ospo

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,120
mostly because it's from a university

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:39,120
can you talk a bit about open with rit

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,800
yeah so i i can do that um

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,399
there's there's only a couple of

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,480
universities so far that

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,480
have been doing this or looking at doing

00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,440
this and as i said we only started

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,080
in august we're kind of all over the

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,480
place because

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,640
universities are all over the place so

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,640
we have to

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,720
try to advise the upper administration

00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,600
on policy and compliance we want to

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,880
support

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,519
our faculty and staff and students

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,079
in doing open work and giving them the

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,000
resources they need to do that

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,440
we definitely want to kind of interface

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,880
as josh said with

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:18,000
the outside world as well as well

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:21,600
universities are interesting in that

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,720
um they have three different classes of

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,720
employees

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,959
which makes policy interesting you've

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,800
got uh staff who are staff they're

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,160
employees and generally that same kind

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,360
of stuff follows

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,680
you have faculty who

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,399
are employees who on the one hand are

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,920
supposed to make their work public and

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,640
freely distributed

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,279
but on the other hand the university and

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,040
or they

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,640
often would like to commercialize that

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,839
as well and

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:52,959
where the where it's my research

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,720
that's openly distributed versus it's my

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,120
research that's going to get productized

00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,880
where

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,040
who makes those decisions and how that

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,680
works can be very gray

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:04,079
so we're trying to work through that

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:07,519
students in general at universities

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,160
are essentially the same as employees in

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,600
terms of

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,399
university owns their ip but rit is

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,200
different than that

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:18,160
and our students own their own ip so the

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,160
existing ip policy overall

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,680
has to make a classification that's

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,600
different between students

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,839
and faculty and staff and in the open

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,399
policy i have to kind of make

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,480
variations on the theme for all three

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,720
and also that we're trying to

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,000
kind of clear policy around not just

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,880
software but hardware

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,880
and and open science and open data and

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,200
open access journals

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,959
and a lot of universities do have

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,279
policies here and there about these

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,279
things but there's no center of gravity

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,560
so if you want to find the open access

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,680
policy you have to go

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,839
to the you to the library often there's

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:58,000
lots of variations between how you

00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:01,040
perform it's a really interesting time

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,040
to be trying to pull this off

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:07,680
excellent um hong you also have a

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,120
huge breath of experience with working

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,120
with osbos by building collaborative

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,880
networks right fos asia works by

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,480
working with all sorts of companies in

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,600
asia to bring stuff together as well as

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,760
individual coders

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,200
and individual open source advocates um

00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,639
can you talk a bit about

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,639
what you think osbos are

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:29,680
yes so i think um

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,079
this is an office that um how do i say

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,040
that uh coordinate different open source

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,200
strategies and

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,880
activities so for instance when i work

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,040
together with the community or with

00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,480
nonprofits organization we do not have

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,000
an hospital but for for companies like

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,160
zalando or daimler right

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,519
so when when you think about an open

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,519
source program office it means that

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,120
there might be some funding there might

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,880
be some business strategy that they want

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,839
to to write in this direction and when a

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,399
company

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,839
in um in a certain site and they make it

00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,600
they have a very clear direction that

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,440
they want to invest in open source

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,720
so that it then there is a need of

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,200
having an office

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,519
or having a team that managed not only

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,360
the funding but how to

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,200
execute the strategies and coordinate

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,440
with different groups within the company

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,680
right as orlando we do not have um

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,360
an hospital but we operate in a

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,200
different way it could be a team

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,120
so it's more like doing the project

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,560
management right so um

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,160
in some companies that i see the

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,959
hospital even inside the marketing

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,519
department

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,360
or sometimes even inside the hr

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,880
department so it really depends on

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,800
the strategy and direction of the

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,079
company where they want to place asphalt

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,680
so sometimes they do not call it

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,199
export equal is a team or they could

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,519
call it but department is

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,720
um really depends but but in general

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,120
it's more about

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,240
coordinate the effort from different

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,079
stakeholders and

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,079
execute the open source strategies

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,199
i agree um and it is interesting where

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,600
you place an ospo

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,120
that has a lot of ramifications um also

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,320
for universities also for cities right

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,720
not just for large companies

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,839
like where you put it determines how

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,880
people feel like they're free to do

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,279
stuff how they're

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,279
how easy it is to procreate new things

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,440
um cat knows a lot about this

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,639
because google as we know has many sub

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,079
teams and the like and you've worked at

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,320
google's hospital for a long time before

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:18,000
moving to academic work with google

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,760
uh could you talk a bit about what an

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,800
hospital means for you

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,040
well there's me personally and there's

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,880
me

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:30,240
google i'll put on my google hat here um

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:34,320
a lot of what the team does is

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,519
basically help people within the company

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,079
understand what they're getting

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,120
themselves into aka

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,120
license compliance

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:48,480
google has i don't know 200

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,880
000 people now and we're still a

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,600
majority developer company

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,920
so there's a lot of people who are

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,720
handling a lot of code

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,440
and what we have a lot of very good

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,240
lawyers

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:06,399
the ospo started in i want to say

00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:09,519
2004 specifically

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,320
to help the company not shoot themselves

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,600
in the foot

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,240
in terms of respecting ip both the

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,519
literal

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,519
and the um

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,920
the objective and the subjective

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,839
applications of alliances

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,000
and licenses and the culture of open

00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,040
source

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,560
so we have lawyer cats

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,600
that work in osbo we have a lot of

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,079
people working

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,040
specifically with individual open source

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,600
projects

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:43,920
last i checked google has something like

00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:47,199
2500 active open source projects

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,920
that were started at the company um

00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,600
or maybe it's 2500 we started in 1500

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,320
that are still

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,759
actively being contributed to we also

00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:01,199
contribute a lot to

00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:01,199
other external projects such as linux

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:08,480
that means there's a lot of

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:11,680
possible surfaces where we could

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:15,360
misapply licensing principles we'll say

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,360
so there's a lot of that we also want to

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,399
make sure that

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,120
we're supporting all these projects

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,839
that we rely on for our infrastructure

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,480
so

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,680
along with teams working on

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,160
sustainability

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,959
governance community building for

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,279
projects

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,480
there's also money on the table that we

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,519
put out to support

00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,519
projects there's a very important

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:43,120
difference though between sponsorships

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:46,320
and support a lot of companies

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,199
sponsor open source at google we seek to

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,399
support

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:54,000
open source we want to provide an

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:56,880
underlying layer of support so that

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,519
projects can keep the lights on rather

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,639
than

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,160
sponsoring specific new changes or

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,679
directions for the code

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:08,000
and now i need to stop talking so well

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,959
sort of you also have a personal hat you

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,919
mentioned

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,640
so that was your google hat ah my google

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,280
hat

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,079
and my personal hat well my journey with

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,160
open source started back in the

00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:23,280
1980s with a little company called mount

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,199
xinu which is trademark backwards for

00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,520
those of us that

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,679
remember mount zynu we were the first

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,720
commercially supported version of bsd

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,120
unix

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,200
long before the term open source was

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,080
created

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,160
one reason that i'm interested in the

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:44,000
interface between

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,160
corporate and academic open source is

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,440
to my mind open source started in

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,840
academia

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:50,720
and builds on the rich tradition of

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,160
collaborative

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,600
thinking and it always kind of surprises

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,600
me when people say that you know

00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,320
open source is an adventure of corporate

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:03,280
life um

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,720
anyway big fan of academia i'm kind of

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:09,360
puzzled

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:12,480
that the concept of an ospo isn't

00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:15,440
normal now in academia

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,480
um jonathan and even i think you can

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,400
speak to that

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,760
how much trouble did you get into trying

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,440
to normalize this concept

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,600
well i i can't say that i actually have

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,200
normalized it as yet we're we're having

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,120
discussions primarily at university of

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,039
british columbia

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,640
we have had for about the last six

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,679
months

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,960
so part of the argument that we've made

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,799
which came from

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,400
the people several of the people on this

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,960
call are in this

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,960
discussion is that there are a whole set

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,480
of functions that the university has to

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,039
do particularly when

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,559
interfacing with funding agencies where

00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,080
the proposals have to have

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,080
certain boilerplate and have to have

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,320
certain processes in place

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,160
and to have every individual principal

00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,840
investigator or faculty member have to

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,039
come up with that on their own and be

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,440
responsible for it

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,400
is very inefficient and and very

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,440
unappealing

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,360
so to one of the ways to convey the

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,799
potential value of this to

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,520
administrators who are currently in

00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:15,760
those roles is to say this is a way to

00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,160
centralize and offload a lot of that

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,520
responsibility from the hundreds if not

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,880
thousands of people

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:24,000
that are dealing with outside

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,840
organizations like funding agencies

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,760
we've also had a quite a bit of

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,400
participation at ubc

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,799
from librarians who don't call

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,080
themselves librarians anymore they are

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:38,400
archival scientists and they think a lot

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,559
about long-term storage of data

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,000
how data is made available to different

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,400
communities

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,679
so when they heard about this they they

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,960
got quite excited

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:51,440
and then we have people in the it office

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,000
who also see the potential benefit that

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,520
the

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,960
ultimate decision maker at

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,480
probably at both of the universities i'm

00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,600
working with would be the vice president

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,480
for research

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,400
and so getting them to recognize what

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,600
the value is and then to figure out who

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,960
in their office is going to be

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,360
responsible for that

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,320
is is part of the challenge the past

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,679
year has not

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,240
not been a good one to find

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,000
administrators with extra bandwidth

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,240
they're struggling to figure out just

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,720
how to change their financial models

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,840
uh and so this is one additional thing

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,880
to try to

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,679
fit into that that agenda but but i

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,840
would say

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,600
the discussions we've had so far uh

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,400
particularly as they interface with

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,240
cities

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,480
there's a lot of interest and a lot of

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,520
enthusiasm and and a lot of potential

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,120
champions that we could tap into

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,360
i think you're speaking a lot to my next

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,480
question which is how do you establish a

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,960
culture of collaboration

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,080
collaboration internally um at your

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,720
institution

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,000
so it's easy to set up an hospital uh in

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,200
the sense you can have someone who's

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,600
hired to say

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,240
i'm an osbo now use mit license

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,480
everywhere

00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,320
you know and that's about it but it's

00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,400
much harder

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:02,240
to teach people how to do open source

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,440
internally to make people interested in

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,400
it internally

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,799
um saying things like you just mentioned

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,520
hey

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:11,440
you're doing the same process 500 times

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,200
why don't we all just

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,720
do that once and the hospital will help

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,919
disseminate that is a great way

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,600
of getting internal collaboration so

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,120
i'm curious if you have any other tools

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,159
uh jonathan fink

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:26,000
for internally getting people on board

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,039
with collaborating in an open source-y

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,039
kind of way

00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,480
yeah well not to get too much in the

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,400
weeds but

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,840
so as i mentioned i was vice president

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,080
for research for

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,440
10 years at arizona state and then six

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,600
years at portland state

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,640
and that's an interesting job where you

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,400
are talking to

00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,480
all of the research active faculty in

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,559
the university which place like

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,559
arizona state can be hundreds and

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:51,840
hundreds of them

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:54,559
and you are asking them to

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,760
do more work than they might normally

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,480
want to because you

00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,080
are you're evaluated on the basis of the

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,520
research productivity of the institution

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,240
but you're not actually doing that work

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,440
yourself

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,679
so you have to learn how to be

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,600
persuasive and um

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,960
and and you don't have that many

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,520
resources to work with

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,360
other than your your personality and a

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,880
little bit of overhead to distribute

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:19,679
so um i think that's useful background

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,320
for trying to first get people

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,320
interested

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,159
that current administrators interested

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,039
and to see the value

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:29,280
and then also to build up uh a network

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,159
of enthusiastic proponents besides

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,799
yourself

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,480
so the fact that at ubc the the archival

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,559
scientists are quite excited

00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,159
and scattered people around the

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,880
university to have them

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,760
go separately to the vp for research and

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,760
say hey

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,280
there's this thing happening we think

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,880
your office should really get involved

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,000
that's much more powerful than

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,559
than i can do on my own so trying to

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,159
build up this kind of grassroots support

00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,679
and then also connecting a number of

00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,039
those people with the international

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,679
network that you've been

00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:01,200
leading is very helpful to see oh this

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,280
is something that's really

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,960
moving along and i guess the last point

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,480
i'll make is that a place like

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,520
university british columbia

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,080
has a lot of interaction with a few a

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,880
few big companies particularly microsoft

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,679
and and then also some biotech companies

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,159
and so

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,280
seeing that what we're proposing is

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,720
something that's already well

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,880
established in those

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,400
partner organizations can be very

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,679
helpful in terms of getting

00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,679
people to pay attention

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,799
i like that answer a lot um it makes me

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,720
curious especially about the

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,000
stopping duplicative effort and being

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,760
able to go

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,240
and say we should do it this way josh at

00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,559
the osi you talk a lot about licensing

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,760
and

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,400
most of what we talked about with also

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:47,919
so far has been licensing um

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,400
how do you suggest to people who

00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,919
look at your license list to make sure

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,360
that they internally use it to actually

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,039
have a culture collaboration instead of

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,440
just saying well we used mit because osi

00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,440
said so

00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,159
oh i like this question sorry it's quite

00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:05,840
tough

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,840
yeah yeah no it's it's

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:11,679
so you're right at osi uh we do

00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,520
we do talk and think a lot about

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:17,039
licensing and

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:19,200
um just just to to level that for folks

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,480
osi is the non-profit that stewards the

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,880
open source definition

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,039
and maintains the osi approved license

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,640
list that a lot of organizations

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:29,600
governments and companies all around the

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,520
world sort of rely on by reference

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,799
the way i like to think about osi is

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,880
that it does the uh

00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,720
the legal janitorial work that that

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,360
makes open source predictable

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,799
for the rest of the world um you know

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,520
and it's that predictability that's that

00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:46,080
stability of what open source means

00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,600
that gives us a coherent commons that

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,799
within that commons

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:53,600
we can we can have uh you know as i say

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:57,760
permissionless collaboration

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:59,919
um that's all well and good but uh

00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,600
but it turns out a better question to

00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,880
save you because osi may not do that

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,679
outreach week

00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,120
outreach work a better question may be

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,400
knowing that

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,240
and knowing what you know from your

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,279
breath of experience with ospos

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,080
how would you internally try to use

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,520
licenses

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,880
as a way of getting at people to help

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,640
them actually have a culture of open

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,679
source beyond the license

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,440
maybe that's a better question right

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:24,880
right because that's sort of that's sort

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,799
of where i was going is that like we

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,120
think a lot about licenses but licenses

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,880
are

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,159
not the not the the silver bullet

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,000
they're not the panacea they're not

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,880
everything and honestly they're just the

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,080
cornerstone

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:41,520
that allows us to build uh you know

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,520
collaborative environments and build

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,120
open governance and things like that so

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,240
it's a it's a precondition

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,919
but it's really just the one thing

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,760
and so what i what i encourage people to

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,120
do is when they're thinking about

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:57,200
license choice

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,640
um think about the kind of community

00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,480
that you're trying to build and what you

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,520
want your relationship to be with that

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,559
community

00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:06,320
right if you are

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,080
if you are getting into business and you

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,360
want to sell a product

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,279
and you're thinking about using a

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,720
permissive open source license because

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,840
well that's going to help me get rapid

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,080
adoption you're probably right it will

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,679
but if your thought is that your

00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,840
relationship with that community is

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,440
is to be extractive that like everything

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,320
you contribute is ours

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,320
and we're gonna sell that and you know

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:31,520
you don't get any of that value back

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,400
um well you know maybe a permissive

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,880
license was

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,520
was was an okay choice from getting

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,720
adoption

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,720
but you're really at that point not

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,559
taking full advantage of what open

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,640
source has to offer

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,240
right there's that's not a collaborative

00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,960
environment that's not a thing where

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,600
there's

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,240
a whole community of people who have a

00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,200
stake

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,600
of ownership here and a sense that this

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,799
is

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,039
you know how we're going to run the

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,000
project and i've got some say in that as

00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,039
a member of the community and a

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,480
contributor

00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,440
so i really just encourage people to

00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,880
think about like what is your

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,480
relationship to this

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,480
this project in this community and what

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,080
do you want that to be

00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,720
and if you want it to be something

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:15,120
that's bigger than you

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:17,600
then by all means please please pick a

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,720
uh pick a license that lends itself to

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,960
that

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,799
that opens up the possibilities of

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,880
serendipity because people can adopt it

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:27,679
and don't have to worry about uh

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,080
you know signing your cla or whatever

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,480
really

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,320
like licenses are important they're

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,760
super important but we spend way too

00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,360
much time talking and thinking about

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,000
them and we should be spending more time

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,720
thinking about

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
what are we enabling with our licenses

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,480
what kind of

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
uh development collateral development

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,640
methodology and what is the governance

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,200
for how we

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:53,200
how we manage those the shared assets

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,200
that's a really good answer uh thank you

00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,240
steven jacobs you also have to have a

00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,840
lot of work

00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,520
figuring out how to pitch the culture of

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,000
open source internally because open rit

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:06,159
was basically

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,720
set up by you so how did you do that

00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,000
so it it was set up by me but the

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,200
exciting thing is

00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:17,279
there was a lot of interest

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:19,120
right away so when i first approached

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:20,399
the vice president of research about

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:24,240
doing this

00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:25,840
um you know he said he would

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,760
i said if i wrote you a white paper

00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,320
would you pass it on to the other folks

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,559
and he didn't

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,320
let me finish the sentence he said if i

00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,720
write a white paper he said yes i will

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,080
pass it on to everybody else so

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,320
there was interest from him in my

00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:41,360
provost which for non-university

00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,360
people is essentially like the vice

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,960
president of the academic side

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:47,520
the the president of the university is a

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,559
fundraiser and the provost is the person

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,640
who focuses on the content in education

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,480
and we've been successful in doing a lot

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,600
around open source education for

00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,600
undergraduates

00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,320
in the 12 years that i've been working

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:04,399
in open source as a professor

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:06,080
and so they charged me to call a meeting

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,679
when i said i can't call a meeting you

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,120
guys have to call a meeting nobody

00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,880
there's no university-wide meeting

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,000
called by professor jacobs right that

00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,000
just doesn't work you guys

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,240
have to call the meeting but when i sent

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,120
out the rsvps to see if people wanted to

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,039
talk about this

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,120
i expected to see a couple of guys i

00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,559
know from cs and engineering say yeah

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,600
we're interested

00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:26,880
and what we got was 50 rsvps from 37

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,200
different units across

00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,559
campus that said they wanted to learn

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,480
more they wanted to learn how to

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,960
participate or so on and so forth so

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,960
that was

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:39,679
really exciting so

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,720
i spent the fall kind of showing up at

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,880
all of the official

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,720
welcome back to the college meetings to

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,559
tell people what we're doing

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,159
and thanks to the alfred b sloan

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,760
foundation i had some great news for

00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,720
them i could say

00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,760
i have a funded internal team that can

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,760
help you

00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:59,679
get your project out in the world

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,760
and start to try to build a community

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:04,880
because what happens in open source too

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:07,919
often and especially in academic source

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,640
academic open source is that you know

00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,159
people

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:15,200
make their thing toss it into a publicly

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:17,600
available repository

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,360
send out one email and expect like

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,279
jack's beanstalk it will grow

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,679
overnight into this beautiful thing and

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:26,799
that that just really doesn't happen

00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:29,360
so i i have been able to tell them look

00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,000
i have a team that's essentially an

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,799
internal

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,760
open source digital marketing team for

00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,000
you

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,200
if you are working with a community

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,840
that's established

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,399
but wants some help rebooting itself a

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,880
little bit

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,440
or if you're trying to open something on

00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,120
your own

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,520
that's new i have writers

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,559
full stack developers and ui ux people

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,960
who can take on

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,159
a small amount of projects for the next

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,960
two years

00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,440
to help you go beyond just that first

00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,600
email

00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,880
repository to really let you build a

00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,559
community

00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,039
from the outside world not just from the

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:07,039
inside world and that's

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:09,120
that's really powerful and and i can

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:11,200
also tell them look this is a you know

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,039
this team is here now you may just be

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,120
thinking of something

00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:18,080
but academics when they write grant

00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:21,200
proposals or nsf proposals or whatever

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:23,919
else have to talk about

00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,320
the sustainability of the project and

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,919
almost all of the federal agencies and

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,720
state agencies and a lot of the

00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:31,360
charitable

00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,840
foundations all say your stuff must be

00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,240
open

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:38,480
and what are you going to do when our

00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,720
money runs out

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,559
and so i i'm telling people who are just

00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:46,799
starting to look at this stuff look you

00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:50,000
you should write the team that i have

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:52,080
into your proposal as your

00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,840
proof of sustainability and proof of

00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,679
openness you can say we have this unit

00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,519
on campus we'll be working with to go

00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,279
ahead and make sure

00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:02,399
that we'll be able to reach who we want

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:04,399
to reach and that can be a powerful tool

00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,799
i've had one or two people buy into that

00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:08,799
concept so far we'll see how it goes but

00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:12,559
that team

00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:14,399
classes only resumed january 25th and so

00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,960
that team only started working january

00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:19,279
25th we're just working now

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,880
to pick out our first cohort of projects

00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:23,840
so stay tuned

00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,120
but that's what's going on at the moment

00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,080
i wish you the best with that that's

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,559
awesome

00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,840
um i heard a lot of similarities as a

00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,240
consultant who's helped

00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,279
various companies figure out how to do

00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,880
culture

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,399
inside their company as well and how to

00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,519
be more open sources not just in the

00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,880
inner source side

00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,320
which is how do you work between teams

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,000
but how do you actually get people

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,840
interested in contributing back to open

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,880
source outside of the company

00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,720
a lot of what you're saying about

00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,000
getting people together and saying we

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,159
already have this stuff

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,480
you already do this here this will just

00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,399
magnify it really spoke to me

00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:57,200
um hong i was wondering if it was the

00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:59,600
same with you with your work

00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,760
yes so i want to talk a little bit about

00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,159
salando i think it is a good example

00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,159
here

00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,440
is this is a european-based company

00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:07,519
right and they also

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,840
one of the biggest like fashion uh

00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,240
platform

00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:14,720
around when i first started as orlando

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,799
i want to to say that i chose to work

00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,919
with salando because

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:21,760
um i was very impressed by the open

00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,679
source projects that they released

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,360
on github so they released about 200

00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:26,000
different open source projects and some

00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,799
of

00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,519
them being used by our members in the

00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,799
community

00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:34,720
in asia yeah and they

00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,240
they publish also a lot of process how

00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:39,360
they work inside orlando

00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,880
um to the outside world and when i still

00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,559
remember when i first

00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,399
the first day when i started at essa

00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,519
lando i got a message from a colleague

00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:48,000
inside saying that

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,799
oh it's so welcome on board we actually

00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
met uh

00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:53,840
through your work at fausta so

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,279
and i realized that when i'm being

00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,760
inside the company i realized there are

00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,760
a lot of

00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,000
individuals who really passionate about

00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,720
the topic and it got something

00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,440
to do with the um the beginning of

00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,039
salando

00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,960
in 2008 2010 right when they first um

00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:11,790
established the platform they actually

00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,359
um built based on an open source um

00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:16,159
[Music]

00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:16,560
software that called magento so this is

00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,240
the

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:21,919
php um e-commerce platform so entirely

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,720
open source so from the beginning of the

00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:24,879
business

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,800
they already built up on open source and

00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,760
right now magento is not being used

00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,919
anymore so we

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,520
need new different technologies but it

00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:33,760
is the core of the london

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,839
of open source so they understand the

00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,280
importance of contributing back to to

00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:39,040
the upstream project which is the

00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,560
project that they depend on because

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,560
if you want to drive a direction of a

00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,679
certain project you you need to show

00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:45,119
that you contribute

00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,200
yeah in order to have a say in a

00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,280
particular project and

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,919
when i'm inside the company i realize

00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,919
that the infrastructure the tooling that

00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:56,159
they use actually making very

00:34:53,919 --> 00:34:57,040
easy for the people to collaborate for

00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:00,480
instance

00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:03,839
uh is only like everyone working with

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,839
git yeah so we have um and we use um

00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,359
microservice as a way we develop

00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:10,560
application

00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:12,000
every team have their um

00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,480
have their choice of technology what

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,119
they wanted to go into so the code

00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,720
written inside by any team can be

00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,200
accessed by anyone

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:23,040
and there's different groups inside

00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,760
orlando there is a very active open

00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,040
source

00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,880
group so if anyone in the company have

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,079
special passion or interest about

00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,839
certain technology they can

00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:33,680
get together and the company provides

00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,119
very good uh platform

00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,280
infrastructure where people can

00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:39,359
communicate and it's easy to

00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,040
organize the event it's easy to share

00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,760
information from within

00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,560
so basically inside we have the common

00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,240
drive where

00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,760
everyone can get access from the

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:51,119
information that you need so there

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,240
also um lion and a portal where all the

00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,079
information

00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,359
whatever you want is already there it's

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,520
very easy

00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:58,560
and similar to kat mentioned earlier

00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,160
when she

00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:02,240
explained different activities being

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,480
done by the expo as google

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,720
so we also developed something called

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,119
the open source onboarding so whenever

00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,839
you

00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,640
yeah you're new to zalando i actually

00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,440
wrote this

00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,960
training for for the new um commerce

00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,320
with new colleagues so when they get on

00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,640
board for the first week

00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,599
they join our like tech boot camp and in

00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,440
this bootcamp

00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:23,520
a very big part of this is open source

00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,560
training so in this trending so we

00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,200
explain the history

00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,560
why we are doing open source um all the

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,880
benefits and we also

00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,160
mentioned uh when people want to adopt

00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,920
something open source what are the

00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,160
guidelines and we also touch on

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,760
licensing and legal topic you know

00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,440
so if you adopt something what kind of

00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,839
license on the software that you should

00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,520
use

00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:43,359
everything that zalando released right

00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,359
now under mit but people also

00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,720
need to understand the different of

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,320
different licenses

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,480
and i must say the culture of

00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,599
collaboration actually

00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,880
driven by individuals so that a lot of

00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,720
people within the uh

00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,920
zalando contribute back to upstream

00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,119
project like

00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,960
um portfolio which is uh very uh like

00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:03,920
being widely used in solano and i'm

00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,079
really glad

00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,000
that not only um it's not that the

00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,920
company said that we must contribute

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,680
to open source but individual because

00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,520
they come from the open source community

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,760
they only have the mindset

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:20,079
of um sharing and collaboration that is

00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,040
a good thing but to sum up what we want

00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,920
to say is

00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:26,079
very good infrastructure allowed

00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,000
employees to go and cry on the first day

00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,800
when you join the zolando you only see

00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,520
that

00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,880
the company embrace uh open source by

00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,400
providing training

00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,320
providing tooling that have work

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,440
yeah i love that answer it's kind of

00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,320
like you don't need to come to church

00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,599
moment if you're all

00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,880
already at church but then how do you

00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:43,520
make sure people stay there which is

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,599
great

00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,200
um cat allman i expect you have a

00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,000
similar answer for google you know hey

00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,079
googlers do you

00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,280
like open source encoding well yes we

00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,800
started that way

00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,000
so i i'm going to move on to the next

00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,640
question for you which is how do you

00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
take that

00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:59,359
outwards how do you as an ospo connect

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,240
to other organizations

00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:06,400
and academically how do you have google

00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,400
work with universities with academics

00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,040
you're still on mute so while you're

00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,480
unmuting the culture of collaboration is

00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,640
what i'm trying to emphasize here by the

00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:18,240
way the culture of collaboration

00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:21,359
um i'm new enough in what i'm doing

00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:24,720
at google that i'm not the best

00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:27,680
googler to address how google

00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:29,680
collaborates with academic institutions

00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,200
we actually have an entire university

00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:35,200
relations team

00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,200
that are good at that and

00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:44,240
so can i answer a different question

00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,760
of course you're smarter than i am

00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,400
whatever you want to answer is great

00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,400
please

00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,040
i actually wanted to say um something

00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,640
that i've been thinking about

00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:58,160
as we are in a global pandemic

00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:00,079
[Music]

00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,680
i think there's an opportunity for open

00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:04,800
source to gain

00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,520
new contributors in this time of remote

00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,640
working

00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:12,720
in this time of job loss

00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:15,359
and opportunity

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,880
and frankly need for connection it's

00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:19,760
great to see you all

00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,680
i wish we were sitting at a table

00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,480
sharing a meal

00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,359
talking in real time everybody out there

00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,359
listening to this

00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:29,119
you can come too we can all have beer

00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:32,720
it'll be great

00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,720
because berlin yummy

00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:37,680
it seems like i mean something i cherish

00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:41,839
about open source is that sense of

00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:45,200
connection and community and

00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:46,720
and in a time where we are denied our

00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,800
regular social things

00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:52,800
and no longer have to commute many of us

00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,640
there's an opportunity there for open

00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,480
source projects

00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:01,040
to fill that gap and

00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,560
give people a home and a way to

00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,839
contribute

00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,040
that in turn increases their value in

00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:10,079
the eyes of

00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:12,560
employers the missing stare

00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,079
there in academia is we have to figure

00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,960
out a way to get

00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,920
software recognized as a viable research

00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,040
output

00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:24,079
that applies to ten-year or

00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:26,160
whatever tenure is going to become

00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,000
but people are working on that we also

00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,119
need to better

00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:34,400
standardize citations for software

00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,839
again so that software specifically open

00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,800
source can fit into

00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:41,760
the academic model but i see a lot of

00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,760
opportunity there

00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:46,480
something i'm excited about with ospos

00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:50,319
in the academic and commercial setting

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,319
is how they can normalize the use

00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:53,839
so hopefully someday we'll all work

00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:57,839
ourselves out of a job

00:40:53,839 --> 00:41:00,880
and open source will be the standard

00:40:57,839 --> 00:41:02,400
and um there won't be a need for

00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:06,480
specialized education

00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:11,280
and processes because it'll just be how

00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:13,599
creation is done maybe i'm optimistic

00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,040
i don't think you're optimistic um or if

00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,880
you are i think it's a good thing i

00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,960
think that's that sounds more realistic

00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,640
actually to me and it actually relates

00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,359
to the question which i was going to ask

00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,119
finally but

00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,319
maybe we could just move right on to it

00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,079
because i think we sort of answered

00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:28,319
external collaboration anyway

00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,839
um it sounds pretty similar you take

00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,960
internal stuff and you try to get people

00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,480
to work together

00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,400
so instead let's focus on what the

00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,640
future of osbos are

00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,400
um where do we see them going so cat

00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,480
wants this ospos to not exist

00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,400
but that's far down the line there's a

00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,480
future in in the medium time you know

00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,560
getting citations noted for science

00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,000
that's a huge part of open source that

00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,240
the huge area that

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,599
needs more work and be great to funnel

00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,200
more funding

00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:54,400
and people who are interested in

00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,640
licensed compliance for that sort of

00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,520
work there that would be excellent

00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:01,119
uh jonathan fink you work with smart

00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,480
cities not just cities all the cities

00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,720
you work with are smart

00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,319
can you tell us a bit about where you

00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,800
think the future of osbos goes in

00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:11,359
relation to that

00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,520
sure i think it has to do with what's

00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:16,400
the future of data for cities

00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:18,240
and clearly cities have been collecting

00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,359
generating

00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,680
archiving data for a very long time but

00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:24,000
not

00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:25,200
necessarily in a well-organized or

00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,800
digital way

00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:30,800
and so all cities are now grappling with

00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,079
all of the issues associated with

00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,599
privacy and

00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:38,319
security and and the list goes on and on

00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:40,400
particularly commercialization so cities

00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:41,920
are realizing well we have all kinds of

00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,200
very valuable

00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:47,040
assets here that have not been part of

00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,720
how the city has been organized in the

00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:51,040
past and we can look

00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,839
to companies to get a sense of how this

00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,800
might work

00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:56,720
but it's pretty far into the whole

00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,400
purpose of municipal governance which is

00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:02,000
to provide services

00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,720
to to residents and and so figuring out

00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,800
how

00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:06,480
all of that works i think and having

00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,079
open source be part of the discussion

00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,560
while that's going on

00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:11,359
is uh is really important and is a

00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,440
timely

00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:15,760
opportunity i think many of the cities

00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,800
that i work with all look at toronto

00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:21,760
and the failure last year of

00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:22,480
uh sidewalk labs offshoot from from

00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,680
google

00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:27,920
to basically create one master system

00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:30,160
for a big development on the waterfront

00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,319
where google or cyberlock lags was going

00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:34,640
to provide all kinds of services

00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:35,599
that sounded great and very futuristic

00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,520
in exchange for

00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,640
controlling the data and when the

00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,880
community

00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,400
realized well wait a minute we don't

00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,920
know all the fine print here

00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,839
there's a lot of pushback and the whole

00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,839
thing got cancelled

00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,880
so other cities are saying okay there's

00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,720
a lesson there

00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,280
we need to be thinking about data from

00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,280
the outset and having some tools like

00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,440
what ospos are trying to

00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,640
provide is going to be i think a key

00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,160
part of

00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,160
that discovery

00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:08,800
stephen jacobs i know you have a thought

00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:11,760
for this one it seems wrong

00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,040
i i i do have a thought um you know in

00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,359
academia

00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,760
where we're gonna see osbos take off you

00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:20,240
know everybody's waking up

00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,520
everybody realizes that a lot of the

00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:24,880
things they have

00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:26,160
just need to be brought back into one

00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:29,040
place

00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:30,800
um so there's there's somebody looking

00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,160
at all the different projects all the

00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,960
different policies it's

00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:36,720
gathering metrics on because we as

00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,400
universities want to be able to say

00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:42,480
just like the corporations

00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,240
in open source say you know hey you know

00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,720
our people contributed this much

00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:48,560
back to the ecosystem right a big

00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:52,000
problem for universities is

00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,760
we have no idea you know everybody's in

00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,560
their own little box and we have no idea

00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,720
what anybody else is doing so hopefully

00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,240
getting everybody to to sign on for

00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:03,599
metrics so we can

00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:06,400
actually share our story with the world

00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:08,640
like google and other companies do is is

00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:12,960
one thing i think is a big future

00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:16,800
um i'm also really fascinated by the

00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:17,440
the city issue um and what smart cities

00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,520
can do

00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,800
and the challenge that these face we we

00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:24,240
work somewhat with

00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:27,280
our um our

00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:28,560
city's open data portal manager and and

00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,280
our students

00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:33,200
and a lot of the the challenges that

00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,480
cities have in open data is who really

00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,200
owns their data

00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:38,960
um because in rochester the school

00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,680
system owns the school's data and the

00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,760
police

00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,280
own their data and a lot of the data

00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,200
that you would think the city would own

00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,119
the county really owns and the county

00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:50,160
doesn't want to play nice with the city

00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:52,160
so it's it's a big challenge and i'm

00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,400
looking forward to hopefully as this

00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:57,440
momentum goes forward

00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:59,680
those people being able to kind of all

00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,880
come together

00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,520
i know that montgomery county maryland

00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,240
often gets

00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:07,040
pointed to as a leader in open data and

00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,440
that's

00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:10,400
something to really take a look at and i

00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,599
always

00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,240
thought that the ownership of data when

00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:17,920
austin

00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:19,920
threw out the the ubers and the lifts

00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:22,640
for the year or whatever it was that

00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,680
they expelled them from the city

00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:28,800
an independent organizer built an app

00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:30,160
for the taxis that was an open app and

00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,040
all the data was open

00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:34,319
um and that's that's a really cool thing

00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,880
seeing more of that

00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:37,839
happen would be amazing um the

00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,400
equivalence

00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:42,000
to on campus is you know how do we what

00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,480
do we do with the data that we own

00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,079
on our employees and how can we use that

00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,960
to make their jobs

00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:50,720
easier better how can we benefit our

00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,560
students with what we know

00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:55,119
those those are the things that i really

00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:57,040
see us getting a handle on

00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:59,040
in the next 10 to 20 years and really

00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:01,359
being able to to lift up the work that

00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:01,359
we do

00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:11,839
josh where do you see

00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:11,839
all's pose going in this vein

00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:19,520
i think you know over the last

00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:21,200
20 23 years has it been since we've got

00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,839
an official uh definition for open

00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:24,960
source

00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:29,040
you know we've seen

00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:31,920
a journey among institutions

00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:33,920
of various types you know academic and

00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,960
corporate and otherwise

00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:38,559
where people organizations have gone

00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:42,160
from uh

00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:44,000
outright hostile to open source and

00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:45,440
that that approach to collaboration and

00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,359
intellectual property

00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:51,040
to uh be grudging acceptance

00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:52,480
where it's like well i guess we've got

00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:56,480
linux machines running in this

00:47:52,480 --> 00:48:01,359
this operation what are we gonna do um

00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:04,720
to to an appreciation of the fact that

00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:08,240
uh open source means we can build

00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:08,240
more better faster

00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,079
and i think we're

00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:18,400
we're getting up to a point where

00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,800
we're seeing organizations who have been

00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:24,240
on this journey for long enough

00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:26,400
to start to realize

00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:28,559
the full potential of what open source

00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:32,480
can bring

00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:35,839
which is that it's not just about

00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:38,400
this these these free as in beer assets

00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:40,160
it's about the serendipity and the

00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,880
unexpected benefits that you get

00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:45,359
out of collaborating across borders that

00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:49,599
would have typically divided us

00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:51,200
and i think we're seeing organizations

00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,359
begin to understand how to work with

00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,400
that and begin to think a little bit

00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:58,400
bigger

00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:00,160
and so what i see in the future of open

00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:02,480
source programs offices and of course

00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,680
everybody's on a different on on on

00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,079
roughly the same journey but at

00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,400
different

00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:07,760
you know different pace so you know

00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,440
there's a bell curve here

00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:11,920
but i think what we're going to see is

00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,800
more organizations the standard

00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,599
being not just let's manage our open

00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,240
source

00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:20,640
to minimize our liability and our risk

00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:22,240
and and ship faster but like

00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,599
no this is this is a fundamentally

00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,280
different way of thinking about working

00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:27,520
with each other and producing value for

00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:30,800
the world at large

00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:32,319
and so i think um

00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,480
i think the future of ospose is is

00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:35,839
moving from the sort of table stakes of

00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:39,760
management

00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:40,960
um to to sort of strategic thinking of

00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:44,000
like well

00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:46,079
no this is this is a core rethinking of

00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,319
of what we're doing and we should this

00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:50,160
should be

00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:53,359
weaved into basically everything else we

00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:56,240
do in our business or our organization

00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:59,839
because there's just there's so much

00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:59,839
potential when we do that

00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:05,359
at the open source business alliance at

00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:06,720
fosasia you've

00:50:05,359 --> 00:50:07,920
actually encapsulated a lot of what we

00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,119
talked about with collaboration because

00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,599
you're not just working at the one

00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:11,040
company

00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:12,160
right zolando is great and they're doing

00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,359
awesome open source stuff and you're

00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:15,119
helping with that but you're also

00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:16,400
helping out at a larger scale

00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:18,880
josh just mentioned borderless

00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:19,359
collaboration and so i wanted to hear

00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:20,960
from you

00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:22,559
what do you think the future of osbos

00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:26,000
might be in

00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:27,599
the terms of how that works yes so thank

00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,599
you for mentioning open source business

00:50:27,599 --> 00:50:30,240
alliance so i just want to say that they

00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:33,359
are doing

00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:35,680
great work if you are in europe uh i

00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:37,200
highly recommend you to check them out

00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,680
yes the future of osbo

00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,640
i don't want to say that i want to say

00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:43,040
can what uh

00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:44,800
kat said earlier so do we really need an

00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,040
hospital in the future it should be a

00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,599
normal way of working so do we need open

00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,359
source

00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:51,680
open source program offers in order to

00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:54,720
collaborate or to do open source

00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:58,040
yeah so um so i think um

00:50:54,720 --> 00:51:00,800
i don't want uh us to buy in into any

00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:02,160
terminology so is it like now people

00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,760
have the feeling that okay we

00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,359
start now should have a hospital

00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,760
everyone should have an hospital

00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:09,440
uh to do open source right so it's about

00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:11,920
collaboration it's about

00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,680
um working with the community

00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,480
contribution into uh contributing to

00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,240
different uh

00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,319
projects so you can do it even without

00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,880
the hospital so individual can do that

00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:22,000
to do this and for in when you talk

00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,319
about academia as

00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,359
jonathan mentioned earlier so there is a

00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:27,599
need of having an

00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:30,480
entity in order to to face with the

00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:31,839
outside world to to receive funding or

00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,319
to access some

00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:36,800
um like process of procedure of course

00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:39,920
then it's always good to have an entity

00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:42,960
uh to emphasize the open source effort

00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:45,359
but um what i'm saying is whatever you

00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:48,000
do whatever this situation that you make

00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:50,319
do open source is a core you need a way

00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,720
to governance to manage but

00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:53,760
it doesn't need to be hospitable uh it

00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:56,160
could be uh

00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:58,000
like collaboration with the community

00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,640
work with people who actually know who

00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,119
actually do

00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:02,400
open source yeah so some companies

00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:02,960
haven't asked for because they don't

00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,880
have

00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,880
um a clear understanding what needs to

00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:09,520
be done so they have uh

00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:11,440
some uh funding and they said okay so

00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,440
seen and we are doing it let's do this

00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:15,440
but but my suggestion would be

00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,359
uh look into the community connect with

00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:18,480
people actually doing open source and

00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:20,880
work together with them

00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:23,200
and the decision whether you need an

00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,359
office or you need a team you need a

00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:28,800
project management or not is up to you

00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:32,720
not the same for um for everyone

00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:33,760
yeah i love that answer thank you so

00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,960
much um

00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,240
cat i want to make sure you had an

00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,839
opportunity you started this

00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,920
conversation by bringing up the fact

00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:41,520
that right now is a great time for us to

00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:43,119
collaborate together seeing as how we're

00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,160
all working from home due to global

00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:46,319
pandemic

00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:48,319
which is not fun to mention but it's

00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:50,800
it's true that this is a good point

00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:52,720
um do you have anything else you want to

00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:56,319
say about the future of open source

00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:56,319
program offices and working together

00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:01,839
looping back to the academic

00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,280
to illustrate with a story i last year

00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,800
was

00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:10,240
talking with a major research biological

00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:14,160
research center

00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:18,240
in the u.s that all their research

00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:21,599
is open source all their researchers

00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:22,319
do that by default and much to my

00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:25,680
surprise

00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:27,680
and theirs their legal department didn't

00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:31,040
know that

00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:34,319
so i think this speaks to

00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:38,559
i think this speaks to the need for

00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:42,720
internal uh coordination and education

00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:44,559
about um as many of you have said

00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:47,119
we need to train people that it's not

00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:48,559
scary that it's actually a good way of

00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:50,720
working

00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:52,960
and then align the incentives in

00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:55,040
academia and industry to support

00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:57,839
collaboration instead of working against

00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:57,839
it

00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:03,200
i agree again it's very easy to agree

00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:05,599
with friends who are right

00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:07,040
so i just do a lot of that so thank you

00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:09,280
all so much

00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,720
um before we wrap up and move on to

00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,680
questions and audience if you have any

00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,440
questions please put them in the

00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:14,880
question tab or just directly in the

00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,480
comments i can read that too and i'll

00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:17,599
field them to our wonderful panelists

00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,960
today who've really

00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,319
gone out of their way to show how

00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,839
awesome open source can be and how

00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:23,440
awesome they are

00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:25,599
without doing that selfishly they just

00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:28,079
do it naturally it exudes

00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:29,599
so one question i have is what do you

00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:31,040
want the audience to know what do you

00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,640
feel like we didn't get covered we don't

00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:35,200
have a ton of time but hopefully

00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:36,839
a point each might work steven jacobs

00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,400
you always have something what do you

00:54:36,839 --> 00:54:40,720
think

00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,720
um

00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:48,000
universities are great places to kind of

00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,960
forge the open ethics since academics

00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,720
and researchers

00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,760
are by the hundreds of years of the

00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:57,119
scientific method

00:54:53,760 --> 00:55:00,000
kind of ingrained to share their work

00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:01,359
and i think it's really gonna kind of

00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,680
move forward well

00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:06,799
as people start to look forward to

00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:10,640
getting involved

00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:10,640
thank you so much josh simmons

00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,359
i think if there's one thing i want to

00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:20,799
leave i want to leave the audience with

00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:24,559
it's uh

00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:28,079
it's the sense that that that you

00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:32,240
are the future of open source right

00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:34,559
i'm i'm right now very um

00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:36,480
honored to and and privileged to to

00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:38,000
occupy the seat of volunteer president

00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,799
of open source initiative

00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,160
um but i only occupy this seat because i

00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:44,559
ran for the board

00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:45,839
five years ago uh and i've ran a few

00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:49,119
times since and

00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:51,359
it's a community elected organization

00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:54,000
and open source is full of organizations

00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:57,839
like osi foundations that

00:55:54,000 --> 00:56:00,240
are made up of people and i want

00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:01,119
you and people in the audience to think

00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,280
about

00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:04,400
becoming a part of these organizations

00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,599
you know have you ever considered

00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,760
running for the board have you ever

00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:09,599
considered working for a foundation

00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,799
you know these are an essential part of

00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:14,319
our of our

00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:16,000
collective ecosystem and we're going to

00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:19,040
need our foundations all the more

00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,680
as we have these these uh academic and

00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:23,119
and municipal ospos popping up and

00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:25,520
needing to be able to interface with

00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:28,799
sort of the corporate ospos

00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:30,000
you know so you're the future of open

00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:33,280
source please consider working

00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:34,640
at or volunteering at a foundation osi

00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:35,520
is hiring a new executive director

00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:39,119
please apply

00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:42,319
um that's great thank you so much josh

00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:45,200
jonathan fink got any final points

00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:45,920
yes i think the um the fact that this is

00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,799
a

00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:50,480
an ongoing discussion that has some

00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:51,599
people who are further down the path

00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:55,359
than others

00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:57,760
is um good to know and um

00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:59,680
i would also say that we all have

00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:00,160
limited time to participate in new

00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:03,280
things

00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:05,040
and the the community that is around

00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,079
ospo at least as i've been introduced to

00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,400
it through

00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:10,000
through these individuals and others is

00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,000
really pleasant and so

00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,680
as one is trying to choose what do you

00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,400
spend time with not only is

00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:17,119
our ospo's important but it's something

00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,079
that is

00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:21,520
uh rewarding uh as as an experience and

00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:23,520
the last point is

00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,960
on this continuum there are some big

00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:28,160
players who have already

00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,440
invested in this just to mention uh the

00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:32,640
city of paris

00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:34,799
is a very uh prominent leader johns

00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:36,880
hopkins university one of the the

00:57:34,799 --> 00:57:37,920
largest research operations in the

00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:40,079
united states

00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,680
is really into it so there are guide

00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:45,040
posts that we can

00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:45,040
learn from along the way

00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:52,079
of that answer too hong any final points

00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,799
yes so final point i think the easiest

00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,440
uh

00:57:56,799 --> 00:58:00,240
thing to start is uh start to use open

00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,640
source uh

00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:04,640
software the reason why we have this

00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:06,400
come from force backstage and the reason

00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:09,280
why companies like google

00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,559
selando microsoft all the people in the

00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:12,799
tech industry now

00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,920
are doing open source because they're

00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:16,400
definitely

00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,480
a value and a benefit so we should all

00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:21,200
do the same so start to use open source

00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:22,000
university whether you're any sector you

00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:25,119
are in

00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:26,720
um the first journey would be using open

00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:28,640
facade i've been working with the tu

00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:31,680
berlin and i think that they're using

00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:33,200
nexcloud and they also like started to

00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:34,960
look into different solutions for

00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:37,280
academic sector

00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:38,880
if you have an option to work with open

00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,319
source software and

00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,400
after that start to contribute and

00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:44,400
engage you with the community

00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:47,040
while we are having this panel i also

00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:49,839
receive a message from the foster

00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,400
organizer asking how can we engage

00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:52,720
people

00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,720
from asia participating from asia in

00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:55,520
this conference and that is an excellent

00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,119
question

00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:59,599
first of all the traveling is not so

00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:01,680
grateful for asian people

00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:03,280
and in order to invite them into your

00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:05,200
conference of course you always need to

00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,960
reach out you need to be

00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:09,040
in the community you need to connect

00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,799
with them so people don't just come to

00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,920
you you need to make an effort get out

00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:14,400
of your

00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:15,359
area actively connect with people

00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,319
therefore i

00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:19,760
i want to take the infinity to invite

00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:20,799
you to join the frost asia something

00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:23,280
that could happen

00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:25,200
next month where a lot of um open source

00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,640
the user groups and organizations from

00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,400
asia will be there and i think it's a

00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:31,920
great opportunity

00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,400

project

01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:08,319
people are always asking me how do i get

01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:11,200
new contributors to my project

01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:11,599
and the number one thing i could say is

01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:16,400
well

01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:19,359
two document your project

01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,079
three provide an on-ramp for newcomers

01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:22,880
give them a

01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:23,520
hint as to how to get started and

01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:27,280
thirdly

01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:29,760
just be nice to people times are really

01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:31,200
challenging and it's scary to connect

01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,680
with strangers so just

01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:33,680
be nice

01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:38,400

here

01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:41,440
i know i said that a few minutes ago but

01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:43,839
it's still true thank you all

01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,640
so much for coming on and joining me for

01:00:43,839 --> 01:00:46,559
this

01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:48,720
little presentation it was really great

01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:49,440
to have you all uh we do have some

01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:52,720
questions

01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:55,119
so before we all leave and end here um

01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:58,799
i'm going to ask a question from the

01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:58,799
crowd if that is all right

01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,160
what are the ways that foss foundations

01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:04,559
are hosting organizations

01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:06,640
i.e non-profits or community groups can

01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:08,880
best explain their work and expectations

01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:11,200
to help osbos be more effective

01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,720
within their own big core for academic

01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:14,079
organizations

01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:16,559
it's a great question who would like to

01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:16,559
field this

01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:26,319
um so we're just getting started

01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:30,079
but um you know it's it's been

01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:34,160
said that um open source

01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:36,839
works due to enlightened self-interest

01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:38,480
that's a denise cooper quote right and

01:01:36,839 --> 01:01:41,119
so you know

01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:42,960
getting people to understand what what

01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:43,839
the benefits are to them as to why they

01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,240
would do this

01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:48,400
right there's there's intrinsic and

01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:51,119
extrinsic motivation how do you get the

01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:54,480
people in your organization to do that

01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:56,160
um as i said we're trying

01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,559
see me in a year we'll let you know

01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:01,200
whether people actually bought it or not

01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:02,720
but it's it's all about

01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:04,400
what can i do for you and what can you

01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:07,839
do for me right and that's not

01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,839
necessarily a bad thing

01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,839
