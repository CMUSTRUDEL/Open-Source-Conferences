Title: #FOSSBack: George DeMet - Thorny Problems in Open Source Community Management
Publication date: 2021-03-01
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Since 2013, the Drupal Community Working Group (CWG) has been responsible for helping to foster a welcoming community for the project and upholding its code of conduct.  In this session, longtime CWG group member George DeMet will discuss some of the more challenging issues and problems the group has faced in its nearly 8-year history, such as:



- Addressing known community issues and conflicts in the absence of formal incident reports.
 - Defining the boundaries of "community" when it comes to behavior on social media and in other venues not under the explicit jurisdiction of the project.

 - Issues involved with enforcing event bans across a global community.

 - Determining how, if , and when banned individuals are allowed to re-engage with the community.


This session is for representatives of projects that already have codes of conduct and know how to enforce and uphold them, but are interested in finding ways to address issues and problems that don't have obvious answers.
