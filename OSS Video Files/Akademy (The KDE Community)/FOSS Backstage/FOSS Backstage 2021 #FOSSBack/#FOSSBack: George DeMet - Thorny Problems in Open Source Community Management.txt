Title: #FOSSBack: George DeMet - Thorny Problems in Open Source Community Management
Publication date: 2021-03-01
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Since 2013, the Drupal Community Working Group (CWG) has been responsible for helping to foster a welcoming community for the project and upholding its code of conduct.  In this session, longtime CWG group member George DeMet will discuss some of the more challenging issues and problems the group has faced in its nearly 8-year history, such as:



- Addressing known community issues and conflicts in the absence of formal incident reports.
 - Defining the boundaries of "community" when it comes to behavior on social media and in other venues not under the explicit jurisdiction of the project.

 - Issues involved with enforcing event bans across a global community.

 - Determining how, if , and when banned individuals are allowed to re-engage with the community.


This session is for representatives of projects that already have codes of conduct and know how to enforce and uphold them, but are interested in finding ways to address issues and problems that don't have obvious answers.

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:18,080

uh so today we're gonna be talking uh a

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,760
little bit about some of the

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,960
like really difficult and challenging

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,040
problems that can

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,800
come up sometimes in a in a community

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,040
and i'm going to be talking about them

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:43,120
primarily from the perspective of um

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,079
dealing with a code of conduct

00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:47,280
enforcement

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:50,480
and uh community conflict resolution

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,520
um and my perspective um having

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,719
helped out with that uh for last eight

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,640
years or so

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,000
uh within the drupal open source

00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,920
community um

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,280
so i'll start with a just a brief

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,280
introduction hello

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,680
uh my name is george met i use he him

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,640
pronouns you can follow me on twitter at

00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,840
g2met

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,799
uh i am the founder and ceo of uh

00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,119
palantir.net uh we are

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,880
an open source uh digital consultancy

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,600
based outside of chicago

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,759
uh please do not confuse us with another

00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,600
company with a very similar name

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,880
remember we're the ones with dot net and

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,240
that's important

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,439
uh so as i mentioned before um i was one

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,840
of the founding members

00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,840
of the drupal community working group's

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,159
conflict resolution team

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,240
uh so we started the group uh we were

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,520
chartered in 2013

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:43,439
and um i actually just stepped down

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,439
last month after serving for eight years

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,280
to make way for fresh talent and

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,280
leadership on the team

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,520
however i continue to remain involved

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,119
with the group as part of

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,600
the community health team uh which is

00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,280
a group that we created uh within the

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,320
community working group to

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,799
work on kind of proactive fit measures

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,680
to help

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,759
improve community health uh health uh

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,759
things that would go beyond

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,400
just sort of code of conduct enforcement

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,480
and conflict resolution

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,760
so i continue to be remain involved

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,280
there i'm also

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,480
still very much in communication with

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,760
the other members of the conflict

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,160
resolution team

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,959
helping out on issues where i might have

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,000
some

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,599
institutional knowledge or for issues

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,120
that have been going on for

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,640
some time i

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,120
have a lot of experience in the drupal

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,840
community over the last decade or so

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,760
um of relevance to this talk is that um

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,959
i was also one of the co-authors

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,040
of uh the original version of

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,200
uh drupal's code of conduct that's used

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,720
for events uh it's gone through a few

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,640
uh iterations uh since uh i think 2012

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,560
or so but

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,160
i i've been involved every step of the

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,800
way so

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,879
um just to provide a little bit of

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,239
context and background for drupal for

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,120
those who may not be familiar with the

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,319
project uh

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,360
we are one of the largest uh independent

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,879
open source

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,040
projects in the world and what i mean by

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,360
independent open source projects

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,959
is that uh drupal does not uh have a

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,080
corporate sponsor

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,480
uh it's not uh run by

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,159
you know a large foundation that makes

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,840
decisions about

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,239
code and contribution we are an

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,879
independent open source project we do

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,959
have a non-profit that provides a lot of

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,120
support for the project

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,920
but they typically don't get involved in

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,040
sort of uh product direction

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,080
we have uh tens of thousands of active

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,480
contributors

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,519
and that can range anywhere from folks

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,519
who are

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,840
working on issues and contributing code

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,319
on drupal.org which is our

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,640
main project and community site we have

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,799
a very active community slack

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,480
we've got there's different facebook

00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,239
groups and pages

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,239
and github and events and just

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,599
all sorts of stuff going on with drupal

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,959
all over the world

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:10,720
and um used by millions of sites

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,760
um one of the uh top open source cmss

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,319
out there

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,160
everything from uh i said corporate

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,040
blogs i meant personal blogs in the

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,280
slide

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,919
uh all the way up to large corporate

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,600
enterprises that you know may be running

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,120
hundreds of different digital properties

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,080
on a single platform

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,880
so um you know and and we've been around

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,680
a long time

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,240
uh they uh the project just celebrated

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,280
its uh 20th anniversary last month

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,479
uh so um and we are currently

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,759
in version nine a major version nine

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,040
so it's um it's it's it's been a project

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,320
that's had a lot of uh

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,000
longevity to it so the way

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,120
that we do community management and

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,240
again when i'm talking about community

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,360
management here i'm

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,000
you know it's fairly loose um

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,960
you know but we have a community code of

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,360
conduct

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,320
that is maintained and enforced by a

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,000
volunteer team

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,080
that's the community working group or

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,000
the cwg

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:13,360
the oversight for that group is provided

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:17,039
by members of

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,360
community elected members of the

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,759
of the board of trustees of the drupal

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,840
association which is that nonprofit

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,759
which helps run drupal.org which

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,320
provides a lot of

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,440
assistance and support to the project

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,720
runs the

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:36,000
annual some by semi-annual

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,800
drupalcon conferences and

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,240
also you know is really that place to

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,919
make sure things on the project and

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,120
community are running smoothly so they

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,160
have two members on their board of

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,320
directors

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,360
that are directly elected by members of

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,160
the community

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,880
so those two members of the board along

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,000
with

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,240
an independent representative from a

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,800
different open source project who's

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,400
selected by the board at large that

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,520
group of three people

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,280
provide the oversight for the community

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,400
working groups

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,240
conflict resolution team they uh

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,560
you know they have to sign off on any

00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,880
members that are added to the team

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,199
if there is an issue that needs to be

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,880
appealed to a higher body

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:23,919
they're the ones who review that and so

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:26,080
uh the the independent representative on

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,440
uh on that group right now is actually

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,199
john o'bacon who's

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,800
i think a lot of folks probably here

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,479
probably know who he is

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,720
um and uh you know fortunately um

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,319
we don't uh keep that group too busy we

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,680
haven't kept that group too busy

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,280
um and uh yeah but it that's that sort

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,080
of level of accountability and support

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,319
so

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,800
um as i mentioned before uh we have our

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,280
semi-annual conferences

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,000
one typically in north america one

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,199
typically

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,880
in europe and um they have their own

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,360
event code of conduct um that that goes

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,280
into

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,960
kind of more specifics around issues

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,080
that would be associated with

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,479
in-person um or now virtual events and

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,280
that

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:12,000
is enforced directly by the paid staff

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,800
of the drupal association

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,199
and then we also have uh you know a lot

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,280
of

00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,240
local community organizations all over

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,199
the world

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,800
uh and they often run their own events

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,680
you know drupal camps

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,639
and those are largely run independently

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,280
um

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,000
and will have their own uh code of

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,120
conduct

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,840
and their own enforcement mechanisms

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,479
within

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,520
within those local communities one of

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,759
the things

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,919
that we've done to help provide

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,960
additional support

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,800
for those for those local communities

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,240
and for those independent events is we

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:53,199
actually do code of conduct enforcement

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,039
training it's a workshop that's provided

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,840
by sage sharp

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,440
and we strongly encourage anyone who is

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,520
running a local event to have at least

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,120
one person on their organizing team

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,800
who has been through that training by

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,160
sage

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,240
so that's the kind of little bit of a

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,560
background uh you know

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,000
about where i'm coming from the

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,160
experience and perspective

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,360
that i'm bringing to um what we're

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,280
talking about today and

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,440
you know what i really wanted to do you

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,319
know in the in the sort of brief time we

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,520
have together

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,599
is uh go through some of

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,840
sort of the the most challenging and

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,599
sort of sticky and complicated issues

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,640
that we've run up against

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,320
um over the uh last eight years and i'm

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,000
going to talk about them sort of as as

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,719
an abstract we've seen

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,680
kind of clusters of issues around these

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,240
sort of

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,440
problem spaces as i'm going to refer to

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,519
it so

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:50,160
dive right in problem number one is

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,839
harassment that occurs outside of

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,959
community spaces

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:59,120
uh so the the situation here right

00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:01,040
is that um you know online harassment

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,040
uh particularly on social media has

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,399
become a huge issue especially in the

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,720
last few years

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,880
um and you have folks who feel that no

00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,279
matter what they do or say

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,080
outside of a project space it's only

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,680
their behavior

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,200
within the project space that should

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,600
matter and in fact you know

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,680
we a lot of the very popular open source

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,600
codes of conduct

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,680
you know one of them actually is the

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,839
contributor covenant i absolutely love

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,040
the contributor covenant

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,839
in almost every respect but one

00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,440
challenge i

00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,320
have is that it does you know restrict

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,360
scope to

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,360
community spaces or individuals who are

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,640
officially representing the community in

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,680
some way

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,880
um the issue with that

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,080
is that things like brigading cyber

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,800
bullying

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,240
other forms of harassment very often

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,959
against marginalized members of the

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,080
community

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,920
but not exclusively usually occur or

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,160
originate on social media

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,440
and other places that are outside of

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,640
community control

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,519
right and as i look at it you know

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,320
if you are you know harassing and

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,640
attacking

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,600
someone who is another member of your

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,920
community

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,000
on social media you cannot then turn

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,640
around and expect them to collaborate

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,079
with you in a project space and pretend

00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,839
like nothing happened

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:28,160
right in recent years we've also seen

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,519
several cases where

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:33,920
you know we've had folks try to organize

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,160
anonymous harassment campaigns against

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,720
members of our community

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,480
and those are incredibly difficult to

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,399
address

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,959
especially when you know there's

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,120
insufficient evidence to sort of prove

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,120
who's behind them you can guess you have

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,680
suspicion you might have

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,760
um you know some little piece of

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,160
circumstantial evidence that might point

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,000
to

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,680
a person or group of folks who might be

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,959
involved

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,800
but you know uh you don't have

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,120
you know what what we would call the

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,360
smoking gun piece of evidence

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,720
and you know and of course the issue

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,040
we've also seen

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,720
uh is that you know you can report

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,200
harassment and abuse

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,360
um all you want but very often uh you

00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,360
know the platforms involved twitter

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,640
facebook what have you

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,519
won't take action uh unless it violates

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,519
their

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:28,000
um you know their rules in some very

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,320
particular way

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,200
you know the other the other issue is

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,320
that you know

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,920
uh public expressions of discriminatory

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,720
views or hate speech

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,800
by high profile community members also

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,800
have a negative impact on the community

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,640
even when they occur outside of

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,240
community spaces right so

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,920
i mean if if somebody who's a high

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,519
profile member of your community or a

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,560
leader in your community

00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:55,839
is on their personal twitter saying

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,480
you know racist misogynistic transphobic

00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:01,760
homophobic things

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,519
that is going to you know have an impact

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,279
on your community it's going to reflect

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,399
poorly on your community

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,880
and that is something that needs to be

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:14,480
addressed in some way shape or form

00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,920
so this next slide for this particular

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,800
problem i talk about some possible

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,680
solutions

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,360
these are some things that we've tried

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:24,000
this is not

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,360
comprehensive nor will the possible

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,200
solutions i present for any of these

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,320
problems be comprehensive

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,880
they're just some of the things that

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,320
we've tried to address them they may or

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,839
may not be helpful for you in your

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,160
community

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,000
so first and foremost in drupal we

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:41,279
define the scope of our community fairly

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,560
broadly to include interactions between

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,959
community members

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,639
regardless of venue right and we do have

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,920
to carve out some exceptions here

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,600
because

00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,440
you could have two people who are

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,880
members of the same community and who

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,519
have a dispute

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,079
um that is not related to the project

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,360
you know

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,920
if it's uh a workplace dispute obviously

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,079
that is

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,839
not a place where the community can get

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,959
involved that is

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,600
that is handled elsewhere um

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,639
and uh you know but beyond that you know

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,720
we really are

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,240
you know and we had an issue uh that we

00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,519
came up with last year where

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,320
that we had last year where there was

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:21,200
somebody who um was

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,440
who was engaging in some uh some

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,880
harassment within a community space

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,200
and then also um following up

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,320
with more a more intense level of

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,240
harassment

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:36,560
uh via social media um you know so

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,760
you know so in that case like we had to

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,639
can we did

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,040
consider the entirety of that person's

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,440
um

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,360
interactions when deciding what next

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,279
what next steps to take

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,760
um so this really goes to the next point

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,920
which is focusing on the impact

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,160
of an individual's words or actions

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,639
rather than when or where they occurred

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,320
or what their intent were you get a lot

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,440
of folks who are like oh i didn't mean

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,279
that i was just joking etc

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,120
the bottom line is that you have to

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,800
focus on the impact

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,959
and that and that you need to make it

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,760
really clear in your in your community

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,000
that

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,120
folks do need to hold themselves

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,720
responsible

00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,040
for their words and actions and the

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,240
impact they have on others

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,240
um so to the third point here right

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,079
you know i want to be really clear

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,760
people can have whatever political views

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,639
they want we do not want to be in a

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,240
position

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,240
we will not be in a position where we're

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,279
doing any kind of policing a political

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,880
speech of individuals in our community

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:40,160
but again you know if somebody is saying

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,880
something publicly expressing a view

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,000
right and publicly expressing a view is

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,279
not just holding that view

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,040
that's taking an action um and

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,959
and when you go to that step you know

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,680
where you're taking an action you are

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,160
responsible and accountable for it and

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,000
um

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,760
you know and if you are saying something

00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
that is going to fundamentally undermine

00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,920
your

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,279
ability to collaborate with other people

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:05,360
in your community

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:08,240
that is something that you need to be

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,880
you know to take responsibility for

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,639
right

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,240
and if you're not willing to take

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,040
responsibility for the things you say

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,399
and do

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,399
then you need to understand that there

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,079
may be additional consequences as a

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,600
result

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:24,880
all right problem number two

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,120
handling unreported incidents so what

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:30,399
this is really talking about here

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:33,680
um are situations where uh

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:36,560
you know there is something um

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,199
bad that has happened uh you know maybe

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,880
a

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:44,160
an incident of harassment or abuse

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,959
um but no one is really willing or

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,720
comfortable

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:49,759
to report it uh so you know what we see

00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,399
is that

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,560
uh you know there may be rumors about an

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,759
incident or an alleged harasser that's

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,639
circulating

00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,560
uh in informal back channels and uh

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,959
whisper networks right

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,839
um but that the folks who are

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,759
responsible

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,480
whether it's code of conduct authorities

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,399
or whoever within the community

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,240
may not have been provided with enough

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,639
information or may not have enough

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,519
information from those networks

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,920
in order to be able to take action right

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,440
we

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:24,880
also see that people may be

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:26,480
reluctant to file reports of harassment

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,199
or abuse that they have

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,160
either seen or experienced because

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,320
they're afraid

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,279
that they might get blamed for actions

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:39,040
any actions taken against the harasser

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:42,160
no matter what steps are taken to

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,000
protect their identity

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,519
or they may see they may be concerned

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,320
that they might get someone else in

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,880
trouble

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,000
as a result of filing a report so the

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,120
consequence of this is

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,399
actually really really bad um uh

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,160
you know it is if if there are other

00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,279
community members out there who are

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,000
aware

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:04,720
uh that an incident of harassment or

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
abuse has occurred and

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:12,319
knows that people are talking about it

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:15,520
but does not see any action being taken

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:17,919
by you know the code of conduct

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:20,640
enforcement folks or other uh

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:23,360
responsible folks in the community

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,600
they may lose faith uh in the

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,319
community's willingness or ability to

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,080
to address these kinds of issues right

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,559
and

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,919
so that is is something again that can

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,480
really kind of fundamentally

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,080
undermine sort of the level of trust and

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,120
psychological safety you have in your

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,280
community

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:45,840
so um possible solutions

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,559
we allow enough folks to file anonymous

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:52,559
informal reports

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:55,039
we are very open with about

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,760
how reports are handled what information

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,679
will and will not be shared publicly

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,320
we are very clear that information

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:05,120
circulated on whisper networks is not

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,200
in on of its own actionable may need to

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,000
be corroborated

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,280
and then to try and gain that additional

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,200
information

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,799
we communicate directly privately and

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,720
discreetly with those

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,799
who might have second hand knowledge of

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,799
an incident i.e that somebody

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,320
who may not have been involved directly

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,640
involved in the incident

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,960
but who may have observed it or heard

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,720
about it from someone who is involved

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,080
to try and gain additional information

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,039
and also as a way

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,480
of helping those who have been involved

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:37,679
understand

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,360
what is being done to address the

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,720
you know what they've experienced all

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,039
right so

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,600
i am moving very quickly now for the

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:48,000
next three problems enforcing event bans

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:50,000
um you know a lot of open source

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,080
communities are very decentralized

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,840
uh event organizers don't talk to each

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,080
other so that means that

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,760
events may not always be in local

00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,360
communities may not always be aware that

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,720
a person has been banned from attending

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,240
or speaking

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:08,000
at other community events you also have

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,520
events that might be aware but choose to

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,960
invite a banned person to speak or

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,480
attend because they don't agree with the

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,840
reasons that they were banned i was

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,280
speaking with someone from another open

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,200
source community earlier this week where

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,760
they had this same thing happen someone

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:21,600
who was very outspoken and was saying a

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,640
lot of very destructive things within

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,080
the community

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,280
had been banned from speaking at

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,480
official events so they just went and

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,080
started speaking at a bunch of

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,520
unofficial events

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,640
um one of the uh things that we're

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,640
seeing right now

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,480
with virtual events is it's a lot easier

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,000
for people to evade bands they register

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,080
under a false name and email they

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,280
turn off their camera and they

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:46,240
surreptitiously show up and sometimes

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,880
you know cause trouble we also have

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,880
debated

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,480
a long time back and forth whether it's

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,240
possible to publish or

00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,520
share a list of individuals who have

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,880
been banned

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,640
where we are currently coming down in

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,559
the drupal community is that we're not

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,720
able to do that for a variety of reasons

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:04,159
but it's an ongoing conversation

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,120
so possible solutions making it really

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,720
clear

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,559
to folks who have been banned from

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,400
physical events that the ban also

00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,520
extends to virtual ones

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,440
making it really clear what the

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,440
consequences are for evading a ban

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:21,360
and we also allow event organizers who

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,760
have concerns that they might

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,880
inadvertently invite a band person

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,679
to submit to share the list of attendees

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,919
with us

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,039
we can review that if we see someone on

00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,400
the list who shouldn't be there

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,400
we will reach out directly to that

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,000
person we will not involve the event

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,039
organizer we'll reach out to regular

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,960
person say hey

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,880
you were banned you need to withdraw

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,240
right away and

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,240
they will do that and

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,679
some communities may be able to take

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,360
action against events that deliberately

00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,559
invite banned speakers right

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:56,000
removal of the project name or other

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:57,039
kinds of support so i want to get to

00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,799
this last

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,400
point right here because this is a

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,559
really important one accountability

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:06,000
redemption and reconciliation

00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:07,440
so this is the question of folks who

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,600
have been banned

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,520
is there a way back a path back to

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,039
re-engagement with the community right

00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,080
and this is such a difficult issue

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,080
because

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,520
very often damage that's caused by an

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:20,000
individual's bad behavior

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,480
has an impact on the entire community

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,880
not just those who are directly involved

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:29,039
and that means that in order to

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,799
repair that damage an individual needs

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,480
to not only undergo a personal

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:34,480
transformation

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,000
and they need to not just be sorry for

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,640
what they've done but they need to be

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,520
willing

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,200
and able to rebuild trust and hold

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,480
themselves accountable

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:47,120
for their past behavior and even if

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,559
all of that occurs you will very likely

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,640
have some community members who will

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,520
object to any previously banned

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,280
individual

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,240
being allowed to return under any

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,240
circumstances

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,280
so when this comes up um we are very

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,440
upfront with banned individuals that the

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,720
path back is not an easy one

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,440
there will be setbacks uh bef we talk

00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,280
with people

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,880
who know the banned individual to assess

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,480
the level and sincerity of their

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,039
personal transformation

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,880
before we take any action we talk with

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,960
those who are most directly impacted by

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,080
the individual's past behavior

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,320
if all of those passes a sniff test

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,760
if everyone is okay with it we start

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,120
small we let the individual

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,200
re-engage with the community a very

00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,960
limited way doesn't work out you can

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,120
always pull the plug

00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,440
and we just are prepared for the

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,480
individual to walk away from the process

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,760
if they counter resistance it's very

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,039
disappointing because there's a lot that

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,520
folks can invest and they're like you

00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:43,360
know what

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,520
this is too much turns out i can't

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,840
handle it i need to just walk away okay

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,600
we'll be here when you're ready i want

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,000
to close with this quote

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,960
from bell hooks which summarizes kind of

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,480
a lot

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,120
of what i was just talking about in that

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,120
last slide

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,200
and informed a lot of what we did during

00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,120
my tenure on the drupal community

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,760
working group which is

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,240
uh for me forgiveness and compassion are

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,640
always

00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,480
linked right how do we hold people

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,960
accountable for wrongdoing and yet

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,760
at the same time remain in touch with

00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,600
their humanity

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,360
enough to believe in their capacity to

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,960
be transformed

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,880
so with that thank you

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,159
um i don't know if we have any time for

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,600
any questions

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:30,559
but if we do i am here and uh

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,559
willing to answer them

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,600
yes thanks george um we actually still

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:38,720
had a lot of time but

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:42,559
not so many questions okay

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:45,520
but um yeah then i can at least make a

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:46,400
comment um sure i really liked your your

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,279
point about

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,080
um what happens after the band like how

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,480
can someone

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,000
maybe get back into the community or not

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,960
under which circumstances that something

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,919
that's often overlooked

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,840
often ends with how to enforce the

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,799
guidelines

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,440
yeah it is it is really hard um we've

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,600
had

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,200
um you know we've had a couple people

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,760
try it um

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,880
and you know in and i would say we're

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,559
probably batting

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:18,240
uh maybe you know 50 50 right now

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:22,400
in terms of of success um you know and

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:26,080
and i think a lot of it has to do with

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,679
the scope of the and severity of the

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,480
incident that got you banned in the

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,240
first place

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,400
um you know so if you're somebody who

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:36,640
has an established history

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:39,360
of you know just being a difficult

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,360
person for many years and causing a lot

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,240
of people a lot of grief

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,679
i think that is going to be a much

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,039
harder road to climb because you're

00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,159
gonna have to rebuild trust and

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,799
connections

00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:53,039
with so many people uh including a bunch

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:55,520
of people who you never even knew

00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,520
you were hurting in the first place um

00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,799
so that's really really hard

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:04,320
um i think if you're somebody who um

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:07,360
you know who who made a few mistakes

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:10,000
um then um you know and

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,799
and those mistakes were were fairly

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,080
limited

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:17,279
and you know and you really are able

00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,080
to demonstrate like look that was the

00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:20,320
person i

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,760
was then this is the person i am now

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,600
here are the ways in which i've grown

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:28,799
and transformed and changed this person

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:31,919
and how i want to repair that damage um

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,919
there's a little more hope there

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,880
yes okay um i think there are no more

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,480
questions in the

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,520
uh chat or questions tool um but maybe

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,559
someone um

00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:46,000
has a more uh in-depth or private

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,320
question they want to discuss

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,600
in the breakout room so um and i just

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,080
want to i just want to give a call out
