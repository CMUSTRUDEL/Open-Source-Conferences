	00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:05,920
this is just going to be a super quick

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,360
introduction

00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,759
by me to sustain what is sustained

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,880
um by the way chris it was great to see

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,920
you just saying

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,160
so sustain is an organization that's

00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,840
basically

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,840
holding space for

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,640
topics like conversations around what

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,240
open source sustainability means what

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,480
sustainability is um

00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,679
open source is a super huge field and

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,559
there's a lot of issues with it

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,239
right so millions trillions of dollars

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,719
going through it and it's all run by

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,079
people

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,280
like me or volunteers or people sort of

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,680
trying to figure out things unlike their

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,039
side job or people who are paid maybe

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,200
one hour a week to

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,320
have a package uh everyone's seen this

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,640
xkcd comic

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,920
by randall monroe uh about the fact that

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,719
the entire internet depends on some guy

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,160
in nebraska

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,680
i like how he said some guy in nebraska

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,800
says nebraska is a bad place to be it

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,719
isn't it's great

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,000
but we all know the problem uh harpley

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,760
was a good example of this problem

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,719
um where everything was depending on

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,000
these two people who worked in the

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,640
basement in germany

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,479
basically running open ssl and then it

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,520
broke one day and they're like oh no the

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,360
world's gonna fail

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,119
um and this is a real problem right we

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,080
have our dependencies are not well

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,119
shored up

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:20,240
uh and it's hard how do we

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,759
solve who builds everything there's

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,119
other things as well right so this is a

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,119
maintainer dominic tarr

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,799
very popular javascript guy and he

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,600
created the package for fun uh left

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,040
pad and then realized that you get

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,720
nothing from maintaining a popular

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,520
package once you write the code that all

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,720
these people have these huge

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,640
expectations

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,560
and this is really really hard to deal

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,000
with right it's really hard to be like

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,280
ah i just made this thing and now people

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,399
are demanding me to fix the thing that

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,000
broke the internet

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,880
uh kind of sucks uh other issues with

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,560
open source

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,520
uh maintainers burn out they don't wanna

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,320
do it anymore there's a lack of

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,640
diversity

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,200
a lot of white cis fifth hit male dudes

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,799
from america speaking as one a lot of

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,000
corporate exploitation where people come

00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,600
in and take a lot of stuff and don't

00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,960
give back a lot of open source

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,240
where people say oh yeah it's kind of

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,600
open source but it isn't and there's

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,880
license stuff that's kind of hard

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,640
it's really hard to be governed in open

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,720
source projects because most people who

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,000
run open source are coders and may not

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,440
know how to collaboratively build

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,120
together

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,640
it's really hard to integrate designers

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,480
or

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,080
marketers or advertisers or anyone who

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,360
isn't a coder in open source

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,280
and there's language barriers and

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,959
there's ethical issues

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,319
and then giving back is really really

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,840
hard there's all sorts of stuff that's a

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,920
problem

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,680
so a few years ago there was a

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,200
discussion about this on twitter

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,720
and justin dorfman said you know it'd be

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,280
cool to have an unconference to talk

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,560
about it

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,760
and then pm engineering from obamacare

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,280
was like yeah let's do it then gregor

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,160
martinez who is awesome was like yeah

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,400
i'm in

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,360
and so a few months later we had sustain

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,519
this was the first

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,280
conference talking about all these

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,879
issues together and how do we solve them

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,440
how do we make it better for maintainers

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,360
for

00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,040
for funders for the whole community at

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,519
large and then the next year we had it

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,040
again

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,319
so this was in london it was pretty

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,599
sweet we put a green filter on

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,280
everything for no reason

00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,800
maybe that's just this photo and then we

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,760
had it again last year

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,680
in brussels this was right pre-pandemic

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,599
super fun to be able to go to belgium

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,480
and see all this great people all

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:10,080
talking about sustain

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,840
and then we had some more right so we

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,560
had uh some stuff in boulder we had a

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,040
thing

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,640
in lagos where we had developers

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,480
basically hold events

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,480
under the sustained branch and talk

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,000
about the whole issue

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,519
obviously we can't do that anymore

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,640
because cove is kind of really tough so

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,920
it's hard to have the sort of events

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,519
that we had so instead what we've been

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,560
doing this year is focusing a lot on our

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,720
working groups

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,000
where these are just ad hoc you know

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,360
sort of asephalus

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,040
if you want to talk about something with

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,799
someone else and it's related to sustain

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,000
we will hold space for you to do that

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,440
we'll run a zoom meeting

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,879
we'll get people interested we'll talk

00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,560
about it so these are some of our

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,640
working groups and not all of them

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,400
um super super fun to see people working

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,319
on all these different issues together

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,159
we also now have podcasts where we talk

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,519
about sustain i just hosted it an hour

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,439
ago for the main sustained one

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,720
it's also impactful uh no sustainable

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,879
open source design

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,159
talking about design and sustain and how

00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,280
do you get designers involved then

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,239
there's an ethics and open source

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,760
podcast we just

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,599
which is together with ethical source

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,680
coraline gave a talk a bit earlier

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,879
um we're going to have more there and if

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,680
you have guests for any of these or you

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,519
want to be on the show

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,280
please get in touch these are things

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,280
that hussein is doing now to sort of

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,400
raise level of awareness about what

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,079
what's wrong with open source and how

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,079
can we fix it another thing we're doing

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,959
at the moment is fundoss.org

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,160
fundos.org is a new fund with 75 000

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,560
already in it

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,080
which is a matching fund to give back to

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,440
developers using this really cool

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,639
algorithm called quadratic funding

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,639
developed by vitalik

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,479
uh from the ethereum space highly

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,960
suggest you check out fundoss.org that

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,680
launched

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,240
yesterday um susan is giving money

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,479
towards that

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,520

foundation we have some funds to give

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,800
out and support all these different

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,400
things

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,320
