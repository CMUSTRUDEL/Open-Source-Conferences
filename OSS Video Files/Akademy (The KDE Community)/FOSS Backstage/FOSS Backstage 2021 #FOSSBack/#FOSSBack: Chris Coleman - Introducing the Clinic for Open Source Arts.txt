Title: #FOSSBack: Chris Coleman - Introducing the Clinic for Open Source Arts
Publication date: 2021-03-02
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	The Clinic for Open Source Arts (COSA) is focused on the health of open source creative tools. We look at communities, access, innovation, and sustainability to help new projects emerge, strong projects grow, and unstable projects change. COSA does this work through training, supporting, guiding conversations, and sharing community wisdom. This short talk will introduce the organization and what we have been up to over the first 2 years.

uh

00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,040
hello everybody i am chris coleman i'm

00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,440
the director of the clinic for open

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,440
source

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,679
arts a new program or thing

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,039
at the university of denver in colorado

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,480
in the u.s

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,119
and i'm going to talk to you a little

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,199
bit about what we do today

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,160
primarily we are a clinic we're

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,439
interested in

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,320
health and thinking about the health

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,880
of different kinds of ways of thinking

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,480
about the tools that artists are using

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,239
specifically open source ones so

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,120
thinking about the communities around

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,920
tools thinking about how people access

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,079
those tools

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,520
do you have the pieces in place with

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,800
documentation

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,960
examples tutorials do you have ways for

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,520
people to access

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,360
ways to become contributors we're really

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,719
interested in sustainability issues

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,800
around these tools

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,160
a lot of tools for artists come and go

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,080
really quickly

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,159
because they don't have support systems

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,920
set up what does it look like to have a

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,960
sustainable

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,760
ecosystem of tools for artists

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,439
we're also fostering new kinds of tools

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,000
very much interested in what it looks

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,560
like to have

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,320
underrepresented people in this space

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,280
creating the tools that they see a need

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,960
for

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,320
and how do we foster that kind of

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,280
environment

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,759
so that we create a situation of change

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,680
and

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,759
you know again i keep using the word

00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,560
tools and that really does refer

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,680
to a large grouping of of different

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,320
pieces of open

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,079
open source software uh eventually we do

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,880
want to move to open source hardware

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,640
as well but right now thinking about

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,680
software specifically

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,520
what does it look like to have

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,479
those kind of tools that are used for

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,360
creative purposes primarily

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,719
how do you make sure that those have uh

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,520
healthy systems

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,079
healthy ecosystems healthy communities

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,399
um

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,399
so that's really what we keep focusing

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,000
on and that art that uh

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,840
that focus is quite global um and

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,039
again really thinking deeply about the

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,120
people um

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,720
we've been concerned over the years to

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,160
think about who's getting involved in

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,760
the tools and who's missing

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,599
from those groups of people and so

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,800
creating opportunities where new people

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,959
are invited in

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,640
new kinds of leadership are instituted

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,000
in these communities

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:33,040
and we literally change the face of

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,360
the communities around those tools

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,040
that that artists are using and we think

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,480
it's a really beautiful space to start

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,519
that conversation

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,840
um i think uh one of the

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,879
sort of specific pieces that we're

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,400
really thinking about

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,319
is at the moment we're running a

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,280
training program to train community

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,280
leaders

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,800
i'm thinking about how do you help

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,760
people transition

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,400
from becoming contributors or community

00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,640
members

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,879
into community leaders thinking about

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,640
the people who are orchestrating the

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,640
process between people who might be

00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,640
working on code and people who might be

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,440
working on documentation and educational

00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,360
material

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,040
and people who might be interacting with

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,159
and getting feedback from the larger

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,400
community

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,400
what does what how does that all come

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,000
together and so training community

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,599
leaders to be prepared for that

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,280
task for many different size projects

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,799
is a really core initiative that we're

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,720
focused on right now

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,159
we're doing that with funding from the

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,640
knight foundation

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,480
the national endowment for the arts as

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,040
well as a melon grant

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,920
and we continue to do a lot of that kind

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,000
of work

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,920
and that's led us to do lots of

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,280
different kinds of projects

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:46,080
including supporting things like ml5

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,239
looking at things like p embroider that

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,280
open source way to run an embroidery

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,640
machine

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,680
and even live coding tools like carl

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,599
and then thinking about how education

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,879
starts with art and technology and open

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,360
source tools

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,000
with things like out of the black box

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,400
that's

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,720
starting with k through 12 and engaging

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,159
them with these kind of technologies

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,799
and then beyond that we're hosting

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,959
clinics which are deeper conversations

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,040
with experts in the field gathering

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,759
their ideas and putting them together

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,799
hosting summits for tools like open

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,720
frameworks

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,360
to you know this was the first ever

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,400
contributors conference that was

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,240
more about something more than code and

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,000
so we continue to push boundaries and

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,680
think about how can we help

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,440
the community uh in some really

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,759
interesting ways so
