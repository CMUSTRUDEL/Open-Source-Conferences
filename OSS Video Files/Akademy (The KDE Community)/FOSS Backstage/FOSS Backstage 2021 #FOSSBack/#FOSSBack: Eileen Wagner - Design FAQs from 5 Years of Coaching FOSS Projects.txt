	00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,839
thank you paul

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,599
thank you so much for having me um i

00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,559
really i should say i always really

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,639
enjoyed

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,240
coming to fuss backstage and having

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,039
these sort of more

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,160
i should say meta conversations around

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,080
open source

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,359
and i really hope that this is one of

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,960
those talks as well

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,560
where you know on the one hand you know

00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,359
i'm trying to give you some kind of

00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,279
quick tips

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,679
um just based on all the design work

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,480
that i've been doing in open source

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,600
but also maybe in highlighting these you

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,600
know different

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,840
aspects and maybe blind spots that we've

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,440
been facing uh this is also a way to

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,600
enter some of those more

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,800
um well looking at the systematic

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,239
questions right

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,920
asking about the structures and the

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,239
overarching issues uh

00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,360
so this is sort of the the goal for my

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,920
session today

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,719
um but yeah let's start at the beginning

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,360
who am i

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,600
uh my name is eileen i am a designer in

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,160
open source uh this is how i feel most

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,199
of the time

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,600
when i am an open source um previously

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,960
uh before i you know called myself a

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,360
designer i was

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,000
a open source and public interest tech

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,640
advocate

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
um in berlin and previously previously

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,880
you know my background is actually

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,240
in mathematical logic and philosophy so

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,840
in case you ever wonder where those

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,799
philosophers end up this is where they

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,680
end up they design

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,520
in open source um i work for an

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,400
organization called simply secure

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,000
we're a us-based nonprofit and most of

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,400
the time we do design research and this

00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,360
sort of

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,320
coaching when there is not a pandemic

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:36,880
going on we host events and gatherings

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,920
and of course in in doing that we try to

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,680
write a lot and

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,200
develop toolkits design pattern

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,360
libraries videos

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,040
to help support the community so this

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,560
sort of thing where we open source our

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,119
methodologies

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,680
is very much in line with what we do we

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,880
work with mostly infrastructure funders

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,040
across the globe um and as

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,960
paul has already said we we coached a

00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,719
lot of projects uh in the subtitle it

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,479
says uh over a hundred projects simply

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,159
secure has definitely worked with

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,759
over a hundred projects i think these

00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,640
are just some of them uh

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,440
i i myself i counted that recently i the

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,520
number is probably more around

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:15,200
49 like that's the number of projects i

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,640
have been directly working with

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,480
so all this is to say like we have been

00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,200
doing this for a few years now and we've

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,640
you know

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,080
come to coachings uh where basically uh

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,160
we just sort of like hey do you need a

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,319
designer what can we do for you and then

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,920
projects come to us for help and in

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,480
doing so you know there are obviously

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,000
some larger patterns we see and so today

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,160
really like what i'm trying to think

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,239
about is what are the

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,440
frequently asked questions in those

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,080
coachings and can we

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,440
talk about them in a more systematic way

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,040
that might benefit

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,280
the whole space so here i am i

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,280
uh i crystallized eight because we only

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,120
have half an hour today and i want to be

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,040
really mindful of everybody's time

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,640
so i'm gonna just go through these eight

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,080
uh there are definitely more but you

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,840
know i'll stick around you can ask me

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,040
more there's also a whole ux clinic

00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,640
going on so

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,879
um you know if you have more questions

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,400
you can always uh

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,080
yeah dive in so without further ado

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,560
let me let me just start let me start

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,280
with like what is the most common design

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,159
question that we get um oh without

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,319
further ado

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,760
should disclaimer these are quick tips

00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,799
to get you started they're

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,760
um not a replacement for ux process like

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,599
i'm not saying

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,840
do this instead of actually going

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,040
through the process of ux design

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,480
um but yeah this is a place to start

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,480
and of course these slides will be made

00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,519
available either directly at the fox

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,920
backstage venue list place or

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,040
uh i'll tweet them out or something like

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,400
that

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,799
okay without further ado now um

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,840
by far the most frequent question is

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,480
this logo

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,280
okay i made a logo what do you think is

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,720
this okay

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,200
what do i need to change um and

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,720
my answer to that is always like yes yes

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,480
it is it's okay

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,159
design is you know really about making

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,599
the tool make sense to people so

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,840
you know if you want to have a nice

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,400
visual design yes that is part of that

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,760
but often not the most important part

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,200
often the most important part

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,400
is making something make sense to people

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,959
so um you know whenever you do have a

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,120
logo

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,320
and a color palette and a name that you

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,160
want feedback on

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,600
that's important but it's probably not

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,199
the most important thing

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,960
having said that though there are some

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,919
great resources you can help yourselves

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,840
like there's

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,520
there's the noun project you know there

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,120
are color palettes that you can choose

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,199
from like there are people where

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,120
designers and communities you know work

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,000
together and have actually done some

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,639
stuff

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,520
for the community that it's open to use

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,360
um

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,479
logo desk is a great place for unused

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,720
logos you can go to unsplash for images

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,160
never forget to check for accessibility

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,120
when you're thinking about color and

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,240
stuff like that

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,000
um there's a lot of resources and

00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,560
there's even uh you know collections of

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,199
tools

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,720
um i listed some of those uh the last

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,600
one here is a guide

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,360
for it's literally called design for uh

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,800
non-designers and i think it made the

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,039
rounds on hacker news

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,479
basically there are resources out there

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,240
use them rely on them

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,320
they're good you can you don't have to

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,400
spend a lot of time thinking about it

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,639
the more important part about thinking

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,360
about logo and colors is probably

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,639
you want some sense of consistency you

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,680
want to have a style

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,720
guide so as you are developing

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,479
those styles make sure it's documented

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,000
and communicated to your team and the

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,320
wider community so that

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,240
you know it actually leads to something

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,080
being used and recognized in

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,600
a wider way so that's that's kind of

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,880
what i have to say about logos and

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,759
colors

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,440
um second most frequent ask question

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,160
most frequently asked question is

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,840
how do i improve usability like let's

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,479
let's do it let's i want to do i want to

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,360
talk about usability how do i even start

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,160
um and for that like my question is just

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,960
it depends

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,560
usability is not something you know it's

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,240
not a binary property it's not like

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,479
you're there is a scale and you can rank

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,639
you know between like 0 and 10 of usabil

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,000
like it's it's always something that is

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,840
very contextual

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
right like i have here on the right you

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,319
know uh nasa is like you know

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
landing like rocket landing technology

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,720
is not going to be like one big button

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,280
that just says

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,440
land rocket right it's going to be very

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,919
involved depending on what the use cases

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,440
are

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,479
so who are your users in what context do

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,199
they use your tool

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,600
you need to define and scope exactly

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,319
kind of

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,120
how you fit in and based on that then

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,080
you can

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,400
start thinking about usability um so the

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,759
first tool i would like to offer up is

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,240
just a simple value proposition tool

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,600
um you can use it like this a project

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,400
name right some project

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,520
is a mobile platform for people in a

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,919
neighborhood to

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,759
share their tools and expertise very

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,479
simple formula you can apply

00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,120
in many contexts another example this

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,479
project

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,080
is a secure protocol for sysadmins in

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,680
human rights orgs to

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:10,240
configure remote devices again

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,960
super it gives me a very good overview

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,120
of

00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,360
what what is it you know is it an animal

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,039
a mineral a vegetable what is it

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:22,319
and who it is who is who is it for

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,120
and what context are they using it based

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,919
on that then

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,840
again i'm giving out tools today um

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,199
create personas create personas of the

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,000
people that you're working for and

00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,919
really understand

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,599
get a deeper understanding of their

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,360
their needs and challenges

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,960
and do just some lightweight journey

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,400
mapping no need to do like a full

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,560
service design blueprint

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,520
but just sort of like what are the steps

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,919
they

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,800
take on this journey in interacting with

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,440
your tool

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,960
um and how can you yeah what are the

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,840
pain points that you can identify and

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,160
how can you

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,680
sort of like uh fill in the gaps and the

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,720
needs along the way

00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:00,000
um again lightweight things

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,919
to think about here's another one how do

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,039
i get that user feedback right we talked

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,639
about you know okay

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,039
understanding who the users are but how

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:10,160
do i actually get feedback to implement

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:12,879
um in our in our development process

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,400
and i think my answer there is also

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,400
depends on

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,440
where you put it and how you place it i

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,960
have this

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,479
image here of you know i don't know if

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,080
you've seen those before you know you go

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:25,039
to a restroom and then you're asked

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,639
like to rate it afterwards and i don't

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,479
think those get really good responses

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,960
because nobody wants to touch

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:32,640
buttons that other people might have

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,519
touched after they went to the bathroom

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,919
right so

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,120
what where do you place that like

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,599
feedback giving

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,159
moment in the process and i think there

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,200
are two

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,919
main ways of approaching this one way is

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,240
to think about

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,760
passively getting user feedback and this

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,880
is just looking at your github issues

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,120
and seeing which ones

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,560
are about ux or ui identifying them and

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,200
kind of getting a feel for what people

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,640
are running into um

00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,480
talk to your technical support team if

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,080
you have one they usually have the best

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,320
idea of like what's working and what's

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,200
not working um you can also offer a

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,680
feedback form

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,560
always you can always just put it on

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,279
your website

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,519
and wait for things to come in of course

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,959
that has the major downside that

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,560
this is going to be uh there's going to

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,880
be a huge selection bias

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,720
right like people who can come and

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,640
actually file something with you

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,399
are probably good hub users already so

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,760
you have a massive

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:31,120
selection bias the other way to do it is

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,519
to actively seek out user feedback so

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,959
talking to people talking to real people

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,279
um three to six

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,240
great number don't need to go further

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,080
than that

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,920
and what you should probably go further

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,080
then is your community right

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,279
just think about like what would it take

00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,720
to grab someone

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,880
maybe not someone off the street but

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,560
like grab someone who

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,720
is interested in these topics but has

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,880
never seen your tool before like

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,480
talk to someone like that and just you

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,399
know put something in front of them and

00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,920
see what they think right like that's

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,320
that's also a great place to get some

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,760
feedback um when you do

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,320
have a github issue tracking flow

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,720
add a ux bug template in it right and

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,560
and the the template should just be

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,320
you know what what are you running into

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,279
and what are your expectations like kind

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,200
of like any good

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,760
bug reporting but just make sure that

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:23,279
you give people in a special place

00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:26,320
to file and to also track ux bugs

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,959
um and finally also a good way um if

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,720
you're not

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,320
you know tracking any people which

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,000
nobody should be doing anyway but like

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,480
you know if you want to know like oh who

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
are actually my users send out a survey

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,480
right um

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,480
send out a survey and see who responds

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,560
and uh get some like basic

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,959
demographic information about your user

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:49,040
base that sometimes also goes a long way

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,440
and now okay well all right eileen you

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,240
told me about how to actually

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,160
you know talk to real people well but

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,680
how do i test my piece of software right

00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,160
like there's one there's a difference

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,279
between

00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,279
talking to people and testing software

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,480
testing software doesn't have to be

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,760
complicated testing software can be

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,120
anything like

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,040
i'm printing out my website

00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,519
and i'm having people highlight things

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,680
that confuse them like in this case uh

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,959
with a project we worked with um least

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,200
authorities gridsync

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,959
um it was just yeah mark anything that

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,720
is really really confusing to you

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,240
and i love this particular example

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,399
because you know we think

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,079
oh open source transparency unlike other

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,880
client-side encryption services

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,920
this is free open-source software anyone

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,519
can read the code

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,600
and confirm that it doesn't have secret

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,079
backdoors and this user tester is just

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,360
literally

00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:43,839
circled at anyone and said well i can't

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,560
like not any anyone can read the i can't

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,640
read the code

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,680
doesn't mean anything to me who cares

00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,120
right and that

00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,639
those are the sort of moments you really

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,920
want to capture in a user testing

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,519
situation

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:58,399
and to that end also giving you some

00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,000
guidance this is a video that we shot um

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,800
just basically

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,880
have a way to interact with someone

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,880
where you can be open-minded

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,720
and resist the urge to educate right

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,160
because in this sort of user testing

00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,639
scenario you really have to like

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,519
flip the dynamic and you have to be the

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,440
learner

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,680
rather than the teacher and you have to

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,160
learn from someone to really teach you

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,480
about

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,240
how your tool works or doesn't work for

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,720
their context

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,560
paper prototypes super helpful you know

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,959
you don't even write a line of code to

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,600
to test anything you can just literally

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,120
draw it

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,200
you know make sure the screens kind of

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,760
make sense um i really love using sort

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,680
of like

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,000
sticky notes are great like in this size

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:42,160
that's a perfect mobile screen

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,320
um just grab something and start drawing

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,440
um if you want more guidance again

00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,320
here's a small video

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,920
and there's also uh our partners okay

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,560
thanks have a guide of like you know

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,079
just

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,880
give someone a guide give someone a tour

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,959
of your tool

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,360
and see what they how they deal with it

00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,360
or not

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:06,079
all right how to organize settings

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,360
super super frequent question because of

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,440
course we love

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,480
having lots of different ways to

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,399
interact with

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,959
a tool and having lots of options to

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,959
customize

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:22,399
my first answer is defaults

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,839
think about how you can help your first

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,120
time user by having

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,480
sane defaults having defaults that make

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,920
sense to people

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,000
that help them in some way that actually

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,760
you know is is going to increase their

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,680
you know security privacy

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,279
uh whatever values you have as a tool

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,800
maker um

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,040
and then you can still offer them the

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,720
options to to customize

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,320
um of course you know when i think about

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,680
that i always think about

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:55,040
this particular video that i shot uh

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,199
in a taiwanese bathroom you have the

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,440
you know all the intricacies all the

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,199
options of customizability

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,279
in the background but what you're doing

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:06,320
is you're putting a mask

00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,360
in front of it to make it simple to most

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,440
people's needs

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,440
right so think about that metaphor of

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,000
like what it would mean in your

00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,040
particular tool to just give people some

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:21,279
help and some guidance um

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:24,079
yeah help

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,000
writing i need to write how do i write

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,639
can someone help me write like this is

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,600
uh

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,399
often a real like panic moment to a lot

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,399
of projects

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,320
um like now i actually have to write a

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:38,320
documentation where do i start

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:40,079
um my kind of almost simplistic answer

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,199
there is you know start with like the

00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:44,480
really really

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,680
like the first places one level at a

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,800
time

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,360
start with what is this thing like

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,519
again is it an animal a mineral or a

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,480
vegetable like what is it

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,399
how does it work how do i use it as a

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,320
person and why should i use it those are

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,120
the four questions you really need to

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,800
answer

00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:07,519
to anybody any reader coming to your

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,399
website coming to your tool starter page

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,920
basically

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,440
those are the four questions you really

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:16,880
want to answer and i also want to say

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,480
the hardest part about writing is really

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,000
communicating the relevant information

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,160
at the right time

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,040
and it's something that lots of people

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,600
don't

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,399
don't appreciate you know that basically

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,800
you know those

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,480
four types of information can also be

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,680
very very different depending on who

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,720
your reader is

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,440
so i just i just started this because i

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,959
feel like

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,160
that's a lot of people have that in

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,160
common like you have like your

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,600
contributor audience you have your user

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,480
audience and then you have the

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,320
quote-unquote rest of the world audience

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,920
those four questions are going to be

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,199
very very different both in

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:53,680
the format and in the tone depending on

00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,959
where you know who your reader is and

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,680
where they're reading it

00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,279
so um just to give you some examples

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,639
like what is this you know for the rest

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,639
of the world should probably be on the

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,360
level of like explain it like i'm five

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,759
right like don't

00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,399
don't give me um more information that i

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,240
need

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,839
uh versus you know a how does it work

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,920
question for your contributor

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,680
probably is more you know suitable as a

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,720
spec or a white paper

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,199
um really think hard about like how

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,160
people

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:22,639
are going to try to understand your tool

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:27,199
and like divide up the bits of writing

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:29,519
in these parts um writing is hard

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,240
anybody who says writing is easy is

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,920
probably

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,360
not necessarily a good writer right

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:37,519
writing really takes laboring over so

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,079
it's okay that it's hard but just make

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:43,199
sure that you go one step at a time

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:45,519
um faqs are really

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,680
great to help people troubleshoot if you

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,519
want people to like look up something

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,600
and you know honestly if you're

00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,000
definitely getting faqs

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,680
um put them in there if you're not

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,240
getting faqs

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,279
um don't use that as kind of a crutch to

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,959
actually

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,639
write stuff right like they're not a

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,720
replacement for good writing

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:06,319
um like i i know i just showed you like

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,120
you know these questions but

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,959
um these questions should be a guidance

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,199
to your writing they should not actually

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,919
be

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,520
appear on the website because it it's

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,839
like um

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,600
it's too many questions and people are

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,799
finding it hard to navigate

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,160
also just you know like

00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,760
public service announcement like if you

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,880
ever find yourself saying like go and

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,240
read the manual

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,679
it's probably time to rethink your

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,240
information architecture right it's

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,000
probably

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,760
a really really good indicator that

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,559
people cannot find

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,440
the information in a timely and relevant

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,440
place

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,559
so um again go back to that like menu

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,120
bar and like

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,000
just literally write things on like

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,480
index cards

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,400
and try to like sort them in a way

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,559
according to context according to

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,480
audience and see if you can make sense

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,600
of it in a better way

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,080
um i want to say a really great way of

00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,760
writing

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,080
is using metaphors um this is an example

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,640
from

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,320
tails that i brought uh tails is a live

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,960
operating system that you can

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,320
you know put on a usb stick it has this

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,679
really wonderful feature of being

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,840
amnesic which means

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,039
whenever you you know unplug it

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,480
everything gets deleted

00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,480
so to say like there's nothing on it

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,679
that can trace back to you

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,280
and tails really found a wonderful way

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,280
of describing something that is kind of

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,840
technically a little bit more complex

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,039
in a very accessible way by using this

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,200
metaphor of a tent

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,320
right it's a tent that you roll up

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,559
whenever you leave you know

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,400
the contents get are gone you can do

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,160
lots of things in the tent but like

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,679
once you roll up the tent that you know

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,160
nothing should be inside

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,160
um and this this sort of idea you know

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:45,520
using metaphors to really explain a

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,080
technology to

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,080
first-time users that that is sort of

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,480
the holy grail of a writer

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,840
um and in this case also a really good

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:58,160
thing to illustrate

00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:00,960
okay ui

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,799
user interface where to start like there

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,280
is lots of stuff out there today lots of

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,240
like

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,799
design tools um how do i you know how do

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,840
i first

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,559
you know implement anything to begin

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,440
with i would say

00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,960
start where you are don't don't

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,080
overthink it

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,120
use familiar ui patterns wherever you

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,240
can

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,760
your users thank you very much um and

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,360
the other thing i want to just like

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,240
sneakily say there's no copyrighted

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,640
design patterns

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,679
right like anything that you see that is

00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,720
a nice pattern

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,559
in the wild you can use basically

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,240
um and what is a design pattern it's a

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,679
sort of like well we'll get there in a

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,960
second but like i want to just show you

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:43,600
the real quick

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:46,720
um wonderful methodology here which is

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,320
oh this this website has a really good

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,000
layout that i like too

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,360
maybe we should use that and then you

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,880
just literally like

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,720
print it out again and trace it and then

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,480
next thing you do you have you have the

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,640
actual wireframe already

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:05,440
right like you can just just do that um

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,480
design pattern this is from a coaching

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,679
with fab access they're doing

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:15,280
sort of like open source user

00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,720
management of fab labs and makerspaces

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,400
and because they're federated they have

00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,600
this wonderful feature that when you go

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,320
into a space

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,919
you can use the same app to sign on to

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,440
different servers right you can say oh

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,840
this is this particular

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,159
makerspace so i'm going to sign on as

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:32,880
you know this user and this server

00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,760
versus you know some other makerspace as

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,039
that other user

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,960
in that server um they just they just

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,799
used a very basic wi-fi

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,320
design pattern i don't know if you can

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,520
see that but basically you know you have

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:45,440
this sort of like

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,640
active connection and then there are the

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,799
other connections that are also

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,919
available that you can also choose from

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:54,720
and this sort of idea that well you know

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,159
connecting to a server technically has

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,159
well not

00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,159
it doesn't have a lot of overlap with

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,799
wi-fi but the mental model

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,720
is super similar and whenever you can

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,919
find opportunities like that

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:11,200
rely on something that you can use

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:13,039
uh you know over and over again um

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,840
because your users will be familiar with

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:19,039
that pattern already

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,080
that's just a tip from the ui side of

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:24,080
things

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:26,559
okay and finally sorry for the

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,120
the tongue and cheekness of this but um

00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:31,200
how do we hire designers

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,240
what's the best way to hire designers

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,600
and this is a

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,360
this is a joke um uh that i should

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,440
you know credit my fellow simply secure

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,120
folks for um

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,720
how many black turtlenecks do we have to

00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,000
give away to get designers to work on

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,799
this open source project

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,520
and i think it's a really really hard

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,679
question

00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,360
and it touches on some of the structural

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:56,000
things that we've been talking about

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:58,880
um you know these past two three days

00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,360
i would say start by asking start by

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,960
asking

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,559
in the best case scenario you have a

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,760
designer as a user already

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,679
and they might be interested to

00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,080
contribute in some fashion

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,880
um there are lots of designers also who

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,960
are

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,000
working in your domain you know maybe

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,360
your domain is

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
you know fab labs maybe your domain is

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,679
uh in browser security like they're

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,640
they're designers who are working in

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,880
those domains

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,480
and you just need to kind of actively

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,600
seek them out a little bit

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:28,880
um or you know the hard part is to

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,600
actually put in time

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,360
to onboard designers to your project um

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,520
that takes a lot of time both from

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,640
you as a project but also from designers

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,039
so it's like um

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,880
sort of a you know an investment on both

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,400
ends but i do want to point to this

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,000
really wonderful thing that happened

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,919
last year at least in my little world it

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,400
was kind of amazing

00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,919
musescore is a wonderful open source

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,480
tool for

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,480
jotting down music any you know if

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,880
you're composing if you're arranging if

00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,720
you're

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,360
whatever it is if you kind of work with

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,240
sheet music you probably have bumped

00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,360
into muse core at some point um and

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,120
there's this wonderful

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:09,919
uh youtuber who's you know a ux designer

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,520
uh who loves to compose and uh his name

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:15,360
is martin curie and he

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:17,520
did this like 20 minute takedown on

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,760
musescore on all the things that you

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,880
know he he saw that were

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:26,000
problematic that were like torturous and

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,799
horrible for a designer on musescore

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,440
and um the way musescore responded and

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,440
the

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,880
you know ensuing conversations that

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,320
would have happened

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:38,000
actually have led to martin being the

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,960
head of design at musescore

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,679
months later right so this sort of like

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,080
small

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,360
interactions you know that's exactly the

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,400
sort of thing that

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:51,200
um we can like hope to see more of

00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,080
by by having more designers using open

00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,559
source tools

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,080
who can then like actually take on some

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:59,440
more responsibilities

00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,279
um again not this is not hopefully not

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,520
an exception

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,400
the other good route to go is to think

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,960
about how

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,880
you want to have design contributions

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,000
rather than just code contributions for

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,960
your project

00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,640
this is from elementary os which is a

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,440
kind of like a

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,159
mac like linux distribution that you can

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,600
use

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,720
and they don't just have you know how to

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,760
support us

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,039
as a web developer um as a desktop uh

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:30,320
developer

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:31,279
they also have design like if you're a

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,880
designer

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,880
this is how you can be part of the

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,840
conversation and so that's something i

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,400
think

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,520
more people can more projects more

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,000
people can think about

00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,200
uh introducing like basically what are

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,919
the like

00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,279
things that designers can contribute to

00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,799
how do you make it easy

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:52,400
in terms of onboarding them and

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,400
including them as part of the community

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,440
i should also say working in open source

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,440
with all of its you know ups and downs

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,600
it also means having huge amount of

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,000
variety and working on hard problems and

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,480
having lots of impact right so

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,120
designers actually once they come in

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,120
here

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,039
they're really motivated to work more on

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,840
it like i listed some of the

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,559
topics that i worked on just in the last

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,600
two years

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,799
and i don't know if i should read it but

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,000
like basically you know like

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:24,400
how to design a privacy-minded

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,840
period tracker how to teach people about

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,840
in-browser malware

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,440
how to reliably document human rights

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,760
violations these are all like

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,960
different questions that you can touch

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,120
on just by like

00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,880
joining an open source project and i

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,240
feel like these are the kind of things

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,720
that we can

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,000
uh you know advocate for more also in

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,559
the design circles

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,919
um that this is really you know once you

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,320
once you kind of

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,919
get over the first initial hurdle of

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,320
joining an open source project

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,960
that there is actually a lot of fun um

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:56,080
and joy

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,559
to the work that that we all do

00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,919
um finally i would you know be a miss if

00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,919
i don't point you to

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,000
uh open source design the community of

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,679
designers who have been here for years

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,320
and have been saying the same things for

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,279
years

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,240
uh they have a job board uh you can find

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,279
it um

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,679
at you know

00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:16,240
opensource.opensourcedesign.net

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,880
jobs um where you can post you know

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,120
specific

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,799
asks that you might have and this is

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,000
also a place where designers can come

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:27,600
in and maybe pick a thing up or too

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,720
um so that leaves me with you know

00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,520
major things to to to take home uh talk

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,039
to your users

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,720
and your potential users you know

00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:37,919
understand the needs and pains

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,760
uh not just of those who are currently

00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,240
using your tool but hopefully who might

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,240
be using your tool in the future

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,520
always focus on onboarding explanations

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,600
and documentation

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,679
rather than just like the pretty the

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,200
logos

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,600
and really help guide your users with

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,840
good writing from their ui's

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,520
easy way finding just sort of put

00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,120
yourself in their shoes and see what

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,279
what would happen

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,200
and the most important thing maybe ux

00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:05,200
and ui design is a mindset i think

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,720
rather than a craft

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,400
just thinking about usability and

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,799
accessibility

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,320
is is sort of a perspective it's a lens

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,640
on things um

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,679
applying that perspective is way more

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,840
important

00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,360
than yeah making things look pretty or

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,039
having a logo i think it's more

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,080
important to really be able to

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:26,559
empathize with your users

00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,720
um i put some more design resources

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,640
under simplysecure.org

00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,880
ux starter pack there you'll find some

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,039
like basics like in terms of persona

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:38,080
templates uh

00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,799
user testing guides value proposition

00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,600
tools

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,799
and more so you know you're very welcome

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,480
to use it and if you

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:47,440
ever have any questions please do get

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,600
back to us i also want to point you to

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,279
two more talks today i think immediately

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,840
after my talk right here in prince allah

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,600
back

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,520
bailin my fellow open source designer

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,520
we'll be talking about user research and

00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,320
why we are so scared of it

00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,960
um related to that also later scott

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,360
jensen

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:08,000
a ux designer has tried open source but

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,559
failed so i really look forward to that

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,960
talk

00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,760
um i hope we'll touch on more topics

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,159
about you know

00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,880
the systematic issues around design and

00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,520
open source

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,559
and don't forget there is a ux clinic so

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,120
please do

00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:23,120
come by and you know ask us more

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,559
questions that i can include in the

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,159
future versions of faqs from design

00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:32,159
coaching

00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:33,840
that's it from me this is me um and yeah

00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:37,679
i'm gonna stick around a little bit for

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,679
more questions if you have any questions

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:42,320
yeah so first of all thank you very much

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,640
for this a very interesting talk um i

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,679
learned a lot actually um

00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,600
i will try to to put to work soon um but

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,000
we actually also we had a few questions

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,120
um

00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,240
on our platform um

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,880
so i'll just start with those

00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,200
um the first question is do you think

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,000
that users could report ux problems

00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,399
better if uh fos operating systems like

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,720
linux provided better tools to

00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:11,039
record and paste short videos and

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,039
screens

00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:15,279
yeah i think that's i think that's a

00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,480
good way to get user feedback if you

00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,720
don't have any other

00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,799
solutions but i've been saying that

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,120
literally talking to people will get you

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:24,559
better information and this is and i

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:27,840
really do believe that

00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:28,559
qualitative information is is not to be

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,640
replaced

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,240
um yes you can have screen recordings

00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,159
and you can get more data and you can

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,360
have it built in more i i don't think

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,440
that's a bad idea

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,360
but i really do think that there's no

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:42,000
way around actually just sitting down

00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,360
with the person and testing it

00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,440
okay and the other question is a bit

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,679
more uh specific

00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,480
and one of the projects you talked about

00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,880
um entails do they specifically

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,080
research how to make the default better

00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,880
because if you start

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,240
from scratch every time um yeah usually

00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,520
on linux systems you have to

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,960
like build up as a convenient um yeah

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,840
starting point for you

00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,320
um yeah how do they approach that yeah i

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,320
should say

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,480
tails out of the many many sort of

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:13,440
security-minded open source projects is

00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:15,440
one of the most user-focused

00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,960
projects i think and teams they really

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,760
have usability in mind first and

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,440
foremost

00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,200
so when they make decisions and you know

00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,200
i'm not part of the tales team but

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,039
my understanding is they really think

00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,679
hard about what the defaults are

00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:28,240
what is the like minimum required things

00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,320
that

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,480
people need in this particular operating

00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:35,200
system and how can we make the defaults

00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,000
saner than usual i work with them

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,480
especially around

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,240
explaining tales to new users and also

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,600
in the onboarding flow so you can kind

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,840
of see like

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,840
more guidance more explanation always

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,880
helps but yeah the other point about

00:30:45,840 --> 00:31:05,840
sane defaults um i think also stands so

00:30:48,880 --> 00:31:05,840
i hope this answers the question

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,200
