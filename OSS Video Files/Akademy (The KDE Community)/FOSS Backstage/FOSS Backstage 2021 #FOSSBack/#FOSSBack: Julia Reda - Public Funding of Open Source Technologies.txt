	00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,920
thanks for coming you again

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,960
thank you yeah it's a great pleasure to

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,280
be here and

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,320
uh to speak on this important subject

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,640
you've already

00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,960
said i think the most important

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,640
biographical facts about myself

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,720
uh i would just like to add for

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,000
transparency's sake that i am

00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,400
nowadays also a board member of the

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,640
open knowledge foundation germany which

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,279
is also working on this subject of

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,880
funding

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:37,920
uh open source technology um so today

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,960
however i am representing myself as a

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,440
private person who is passionate about

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,440
free software and already when i was a

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,719
member of the european parliament i was

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,840
trying to convince

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,000
governments to take um free and open

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,960
source software more seriously

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,160
as a matter of public policy and uh

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,039
today

00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,039
i want to give you an update on my

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,039
thinking on this and also some of the

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,000
work that i've been doing with other

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,720
free software policy activists in order

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,280
to

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,799
make more public funding for open source

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,760
technology a reality

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,640
in europe so i want to start with a

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,280
pretty

00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,840
i would say high level of observation

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,479
about

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,880
what government actually is and what

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,560
what its purpose is so like on a very

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,600
idealized

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,320
uh very high level view the government

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,479
is

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,600
supposed to be all of us so it's

00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,920
representing

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,759
the entire population and trying to

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,360
serve all of the population and be

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,240
accountable to it

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,040
and one very important function that

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,079
government

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,880
provides for its population is to

00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,320
uh provide to build and to maintain

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,520
infrastructure

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,240
and in the past this was mostly

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,240
sort of thought of as uh maintaining

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,240
roads or making sure that there is a

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,960
fire service and

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,280
other public services like that but i

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,960
think

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,439
more and more software has become

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,599
such an infrastructure for public life

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,239
and we are seeing this really more than

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,560
ever

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,239
during the coronavirus pandemic i mean i

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,560
was looking at this slide

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,520
that i have used before and it very much

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,760
looks like

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,840
a scene from a different world uh now

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,160
that we're in lockdown and our

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,480
daily lives all parts of it education

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,680
etc have really become more and more

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,040
mediated

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,280
by technology and i think that

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,040
the government should therefore have a

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,840
free software philosophy

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,720
at its heart which is to use free

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,280
software

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,680
to take responsibility for it and also

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,080
to contribute to the development of

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,480
free and open source software because it

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,040
really forms part of the backbone

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,680
of public service that governments are

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,840
responsible for

00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:01,040
um it's quite quite certain i think

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,599
also that nowadays in this very

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,920
technologically mediated society those

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,480
who build the technology have a lot of

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,440
power

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,840
and this phrase algorithms rule the

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,159
world

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,200
is maybe a little bit cheeky in the

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,680
sense that

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,400
it sounds sort of like some of these

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,519
really

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,519
um sensational headlines that are trying

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,360
to pretend that software is magic

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,519
and this is not what i'm trying to say

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,920
with this so i'm not saying you know

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,080
algorithms are are scary and therefore

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,400
we should ban them or anything like that

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,599
which is popular with some politicians

00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,879
but rather in the sense that computers

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,760
are no longer

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:41,120
limited to particular parts of our lives

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,599
but instead

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,680
all of our society is mediated by

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,080
technology and

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,720
this is leading sometimes to some really

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,760
fun

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,239
and weird problems like uh you know

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,879
this twitter account internet of is

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,159
uh

00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,879
um collecting sort of funny

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,720
problems funny bugs with uh the internet

00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,360
of things where you could have

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,439
uh a blue screen of death on a fridge

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,720
which is maybe not like the greatest

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:13,360
uh utopian scenario so

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,840
um nowadays of course with the

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,120
coronavirus this has become

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,560
even more obvious because

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,639
all of a sudden we had to improvise

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,800
digital solutions for a lot of things

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,800
that we used to do physically

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,320
and at the center of the discussion has

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,000
sort of been zoom

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,160
and whether it's a good idea that

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,120
everybody is using this proprietary

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,479
software

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,960
um but because it was a crisis

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,479
uh when the first lockdown started a

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,680
year ago

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:48,800
the sort of normative power of

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,600
having something that works out of the

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,040
box

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,280
sort of took over but um i think

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,080
one year into the crisis we should no

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,280
longer

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,600
take this uh excuse that we were in a

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,960
crisis situation and instead really

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:07,360
ask our governments to also help

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,520
support and provide open source

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,160
alternatives that have the same sort of

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:13,120
backbone

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,680
power that a proprietary software like

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,199
zoom can provide and also the same

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,120
usability which also is you know needs

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,479
to be developed needs to be tested and

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,639
can be quite expensive

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,680
and everybody benefits from it being

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,000
there but

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,919
not everybody feels responsible to

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
contribute to it and to pay for it

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,000
the same is true in other parts of

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,520
society like schools

00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,600
businesses and even the public

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,000
administrations themselves like

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,320
i come from germany and german public

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,880
administration has been very reluctant

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,919
to digitizing a lot of its services for

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,440
a long time

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:52,160
but now that a lot of public services

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,720
had to close their physical spaces it's

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,639
really

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,800
become so urgent that they have to

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,840
seriously deal with these questions

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,160
so quite often we end up using

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,360
improvised proprietary solutions that

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,000
actually conflict

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,000
with our own data security and data

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,400
protection standards

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,560
so i think we've established

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,960
at this point that software is playing

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,000
this increasingly important role in our

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,600
society

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,680
and then the question is okay what

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,039
should be the government's role in it

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,360
um i think it would be somewhat

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,160
dangerous if government was centrally

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,240
controlling

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,520
open source software projects because of

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,520
course um

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,520
the permissionless innovation and the

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,880
the possibility that really everybody

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,759
can participate uh

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,280
in free software projects um without

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,400
some sort of central

00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,560
control and planning is really what has

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,479
made free software so successful so i

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,759
think it's really more about

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:54,240
creating the awareness

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,479
within governments that they are already

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,479
relying on free and open source software

00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,440
every day whether they are aware of it

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,000
or not

00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,080
because quite often politicians

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,639
understanding of software is very much

00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,319
focused on the application layer only

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,639
and they don't know all the software

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,400
libraries or the server infrastructure

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,120
that is run on open source

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,080
even in their own institutions so my

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,039
goal is that

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,000
uh governments realize this better and

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,720
start taking more responsibility

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,199
to actually support the security and

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,000
safety of their own it infrastructures

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:34,080
but by that also start contributing more

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:36,240
to the overall software ecosystem

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,080
there is a very i think somewhat

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,199
dangerous debate going on

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,039
at the moment in europe about digital

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,000
sovereignty

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,560
that is sort of trying to frame the

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,440
dependence on proprietary software as a

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,120
nationalist

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,039
issue and i don't really like this

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,919
framing because for me

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,120
the point is not that you know amazon or

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,039
microsoft are

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,720
american companies but i think the

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,840
problem is really more

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,240
that um if the uh

00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,000
open source software that we are using

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,319
on a day-to-day basis

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,879
is not accessible to a security audits

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,919
and to modification that actually suits

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,599
our needs

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:22,000
so i think we should not promote this

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,120
idea of digital sovereignty as sort of

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,280
trying to

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,680
separate the internet and digital

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,639
technology into different geopolitical

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,680
spheres

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:34,080
actually that is an idea that china

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,959
and russia have been promoting in the

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,919
past

00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,919
at for example international internet

00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,760
governance discussions that basically

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,560
the internet should not be a global

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,320
medium

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,399
i think we should actually take this

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,839
discussion around digital sovereignty in

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,720
a different direction

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,080
so the kind of digital sovereignty that

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,480
makes sense to me

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,080
is to say okay if we have a lot of free

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,560
and open source software

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,560
that provides the basic infrastructure

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,440
that a state needs to function and that

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,360
the economy

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,880
and the educational system needs to

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,320
function then

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,959
we become less dependent on a single

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,519
government

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,680
or on a single company regardless of

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,519
which country that company is from or

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,399
whether it's a multinational

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:22,000
so digital sovereignty can actually be

00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:23,200
interconnectedness and decentralization

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
instead of trying to

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,200
sort of lock ourselves up off from the

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,279
rest of the world

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,240
i don't really care if software is made

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,560
in germany

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,000
as long as it is made open source and so

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,240
i think

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,120
it's important to kind of instill this

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,160
thinking also in public administrations

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:45,200
to sort of go away from only funding

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,360
companies that sort of immediately and

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,000
directly contribute to the economic

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,880
growth of

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,760
that particular country and instead also

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,160
look at

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,440
what is the basis for all of that

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,720
economic growth

00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,240
what is the free infrastructure that at

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,040
the end of the day benefits

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,079
all of us because i don't think that

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,720
global politics

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:10,240
is a zero-sum game where we can only

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:14,000
benefit if somebody else is losing out

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,000
so um i think this idea of sort of

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,360
digital sovereignty as

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,079
embodying decentralization connectedness

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,240
and

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,600
permissionless innovation is actually

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,519
pretty well

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,640
um established in one already existing

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,959
u.s based

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,399
uh open source funding program the open

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,360
technology fund

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,760
so uh this is a pretty good program that

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,839
uh

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,839
we all benefit from even though it's

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,160
paid for by the u.s government

00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,200
but it is not run by the us government

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,360
it's run by

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,399
an independent ngo that has been

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,839
receiving

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,880
public funding from congress in order to

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:55,200
promote primarily anti-censorship

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,079
technology so they have funded things

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,200
like signal

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,800
or tor or wireguard so also privacy

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,880
technologies that help

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,200
democracy activists independent

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:09,040
journalists around the world

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,640
um in countries such as belarus or hong

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,200
kong or iran

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,079
to stand up to authoritarian governments

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,079
and so of course

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,000
this has been sort of in the interest of

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:21,760
the us government as well

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,600
but nobody is stopping the

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:26,079
you know activists in other countries

00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,839
that may not be aligned with u.s policy

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,920
from using those open source

00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,560
technologies precisely because they are

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,560
open source and so i'm sure that a lot

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,040
of the developers who have

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,680
received public funding from the open

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,480
technology fund do not agree with the

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,560
us government's policies at all i mean

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,519
uh just look at sort of the surveillance

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,079
programs at the

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,079
of the us but because there is a

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,079
separation between it where

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,240
money is coming from the public sector

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,000
but the organization of the funding is

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,000
done by civil society

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,760
this is why people can trust these kinds

00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,880
of projects and so i think it's a good

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,920
model

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:07,680
that we should learn from so

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,920
the problem though that was exposed with

00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,120
the open technology fund is that last

00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,519
year

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,399
this project was under extreme threat

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,320
because

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,160
there was a single point of failure

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,360
because basically if you only have this

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,399
one project

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,959
that lots and lots of open source

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,240
technology projects rely on this one

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,240
funding source

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:32,480
then a single authoritarian regime can

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,800
also try to shut it down and this was

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:39,120
actually something that was attempted

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:41,519
by the trump administration last year so

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,800
president trump appointed one of his

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:46,000
allies to the u.s

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,320
agency for global media who

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,839
fired executives from the open

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,519
technology fund

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,560
froze its funding and also even tried to

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,040
get the otf

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,639
permanently banned from receiving u.s

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,519
funding even after

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,320
uh he would leave office now unfortunate

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,880
uh let's say

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,000
fortunately this attack on the open

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,160
technology fund was

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,040
not successful because they actually had

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,440
support

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,240
from both parties in congress and were

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,519
able to

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,600
um protect it from um

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,600
from this attack and now under the biden

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,680
administration it's pretty clear

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,200
that the open technology fund will be

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,120
able to continue

00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,800
but i think what this means for us

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,160
european is that

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,079
we are not very digitally sovereign if

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,000
uh basically a single government

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:37,120
somewhere else in the world can

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,079
go down an authoritarian route and

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,399
suddenly

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,480
the free software that we all have been

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,399
relying on for our privacy

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,320
for circumventing censorship

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,199
technologies is suddenly

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,160
not funded anymore so in a way i feel

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,120
like the eu

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,959
has been coasting on the benefits of the

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,040
open technology fund without

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,279
actually contributing to it and i think

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,399
this is something that should change

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,639
because um if there are more prop

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,519
uh projects like the open technology

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,320
fund that maybe

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,199
focus on different types of open source

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,920
technologies

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,199
not just on sort of privacy technologies

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,560
in particular

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:19,120
um then it's also less damaging if a

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,399
single one of them loses its funding or

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,720
has to

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,839
reduce its operation for a particular

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,680
time because i think

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,600
one thing that is really important and

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,199
that has not been

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,519
paid attention to enough is the

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,720
maintenance of free and open source

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,199
software projects

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,279
which is not as sexy as saying okay i'm

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:40,480
inventing something entirely new

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:43,760
but the maintenance is just as important

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:47,440
so where are we in the european union

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,760
there are some funding infrastructures

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,600
in

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,040
individual member states such as the

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,199
netherlands and

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,440
also to a certain extent at the european

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,720
union level and i'm mostly going to talk

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,800
about the eu

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,079
because i was involved with that and

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,760
also with

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,680
germany because this is the country

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,480
where i'm from but there are

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,760
also other um very interesting and

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,760
exciting projects in

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,760
other member states that i think we

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,800
should share information about

00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,839
so the european commission is really

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,399
uncomfortable

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,560
with its own reliance on proprietary

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,760
technology so for example when the

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:26,560
the lockdown started um the european

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,040
commission was criticizing

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,600
the security of zoom but at the same

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,680
time

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,120
still using it for some of its own

00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,880
meetings

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:39,440
well because it simply worked so i think

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,040
we need to push the european commission

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,759
to actually put its money where its

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,560
mouth

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,079
is and it already has an open source

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:49,360
strategy so that's good

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:51,759
it has committed to releasing um

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,440
more of its in-house software as open

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,320
source and i think that's a really good

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,440
development

00:15:54,320 --> 00:16:00,079
but we should sort of push them

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,040
to also fund open source projects more

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,160
generally

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,199
so um when i was in the european

00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,320
parliament

00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:09,120
in 2014 this was the first year i was in

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,399
parliament

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,240
the heartbleed and shellshook

00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:17,120
vulnerabilities were

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,079
discovered and they i think demonstrated

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,639
that

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,000
open source software and open source

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,079
infrastructure is really

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,440
implemented all over the place and quite

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,720
often we're not aware

00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,639
aware of it and even though

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,880
free and open source software has a lot

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,880
of

00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,720
benefits in terms of security and

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,959
reliability

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,079
it's not enough to just make something

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:43,120
open source

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:46,000
you also have to make sure that there is

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,920
funding available and an infrastructure

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,240
available to make sure that the software

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,839
can be maintained and audited

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,720
so as sort of a learning

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,800
from heartbleed i was able to convince

00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,600
the european commission with a few of my

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,199
colleagues

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,920
to start the free and open source

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:06,720
software auditing project

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,600
where the goal was basically to pay for

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,079
the audit

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,559
of free software applications that were

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:15,520
used inside the european commission

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,720
and then to release those the results of

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,039
those audits

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,000
and hopefully bug fixes back into those

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,959
projects

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,439
and um well i think we learned a lot in

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,439
the

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,959
process of doing this pilot project

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,360
because the european commission had

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,320
never done something like this before

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,760
and we ran into quite a lot of problems

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:37,120
and then sort of try to

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:40,960
iterately iteratively improve

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:43,600
this project so in the beginning um

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:46,000
there was basically the approach of

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,559
contracting this

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,919
security audit out to a company so there

00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,160
was a public tender

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,080
and we realized that basically the the

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,000
companies or the individuals that are

00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,919
best placed to actually

00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,919
improve free and open source software

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,440
are not usually the companies that are

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,600
best placed to win

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,039
european union public tenders because

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,039
this is just a different

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,799
sort of skill sets there is a lot of

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,720
bureaucracy involved

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,120
and there is a high risk that you end up

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,280
with a consultancy that produces a lot

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,679
of reports writes a lot of things

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,480
but doesn't actually write a lot of code

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,600
and so

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:24,000
um in order to fix this problem we

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,840
eventually changed the eu fossa program

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,080
into a bug bounty program

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:30,559
which was also criticized by some people

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:34,480
because back bounties um

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:36,320
can also create sort of um not ideal

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,720
incentives because back bounties

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,400
basically are paid out for finding a bug

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,400
but then there is still the problem who

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,120
is doing the actual work of fixing the

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,080
bug

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:48,080
and um even though the eu fossa has

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,720
finished by now and it has

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,320
i think found some quite serious flaws

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,679
for example in putti

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,160
that were fixed as a consequence of it

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,799
and

00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,799
generally the response from the free

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,880
software community to fossa was quite

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,440
good

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,520
this project has now wrapped up and is

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,720
being continued in a slightly different

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,440
form as part of

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,240
the europeans commission's isa square

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,720
program

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,080
so in isa square the european commission

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,960
is actually trying to

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,120
pay for the fixing of bugs which i think

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,240
is a good sort of next step approach so

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,440
they have

00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:28,720
partnered up with integrity and um

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:32,880
are basically paying a 20 bonus

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:35,360
for uh bug bounties that um

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,640
are released in the contracts context of

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,200
the matrix.org

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,360
program program for encrypted and

00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,360
decentralized communication so if you

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,880
don't just find the vulnerability but

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,200
also provide a fix

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,120
you get this 20 bonus and this is

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,679
actually a program that is running right

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,160
now and that people can participate in

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,120
um

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,799
at the year at german level we have the

00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,799
prototype fund which is

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,520
also funded by uh german government

00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,559
ministry

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,720
but is uh run by civil society and i

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:09,440
think this is really the best approach

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,480
to make sure that free software

00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,440
developers have an

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,360
easy time actually applying for funding

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,200
so the prototype fund

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,400
is also a project of the open knowledge

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,120
foundation

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,840
where i'm a board member and it's

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,960
directly funding free software

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,320
um and also helps projects with the

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,919
bureaucracy

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:34,880
around that so the problem though

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,559
is that because of the limits that are

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,360
put on the funding by the german

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:41,840
government the prototype fund can only

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,320
fund prototypes so it's about funding

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,520
innovation it's about starting off a new

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:50,400
project which can be pretty important

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,480
but what is missing is a funding

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,159
structure for the maintenance of open

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,200
source infrastructure

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:59,120
i really like this xkcd pro comic

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,799
because i think it illustrates

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,000
the problem very well so um it's kind of

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:05,919
a stack of

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,440
building bricks that says all modern

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,520
digital infrastructure

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,880
and then at the very bottom there's a

00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,360
tiny piece that says

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,440
a project some random person in nebraska

00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,640
has been thanklessly maintaining since

00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,440
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,880
now this person in nebraska would not be

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,679
able to apply

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,720
to a lot of the existing funding pro

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,480
programs for

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,960
open source software because it's not

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,080
innovative it's not you know developing

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,919
a prototype it's

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,320
sort of boring it's maintaining

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:36,640
something that everybody relies on but

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,159
most politicians have never heard of

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,159
and this is i think the funding

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,960
structure that is missing and that we

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,799
should

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:48,320
have in the european union so um

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:50,320
together with some activist friends from

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,559
different organizations both from the

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,919
prototype fund but also from the open

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,480
technology fund

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,320
i've started sort of conceptualizing

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,720
what such a digital infrastructure

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,240
fund could look like and also trying to

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,000
start to talk to

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,760
government officials in the german

00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,679
government and also in the european

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,880
commission about how we can make this a

00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,679
reality

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,000
so we have come up with a few principles

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,400
that

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,280
would be really important for this fund

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,880
to work

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:21,200
first of all um we should learn

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,880
from the lessons of the fossa program

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,600
and the prototype funds so

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,600
it must be really easy to apply to this

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,159
was not the case in the beginning of

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,159
fossa

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,679
it sort of became better throughout the

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,120
bug bounty process

00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,120
but it's also something that the

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,799
prototype fund is really good at that

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,120
the entry barrier is low

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:41,840
and even if you're not a company even if

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,240
you're like an individual person

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,080
you should be able to apply for funding

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,559
for your free software project

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,679
um there has to be very low overheads so

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,679
you should not

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,679
basically have reports written by

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,840
consultancies and things like this but

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,799
the majority of the funding should go

00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,400
directly

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:02,159
to the project it must not be limited to

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,280
innovative projects so we have to

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:06,000
convince

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,000
governments that it's worth funding the

00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
maintenance and improvement of

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,240
infrastructure rather than just funding

00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,320
innovation because at the end of the day

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,960
new innovation is going to build on top

00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,280
of that and so it is going to pay off

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,080
for the economy at large but we have to

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:24,880
focus on sustainability and making sure

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:28,240
that basically if this one building

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,960
block in the xkcd comic is pulled out

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,039
that the whole infrastructure doesn't

00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,200
just crumble

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,520
also i think it's really important that

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,400
this funding program has to be part of a

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,799
broader

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,600
free software and also free hardware

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,440
strategy

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,520
of government where they also pay

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,600
attention to other issues that arrive

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,240
such as

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,120
chip manufacturing and other issues that

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,640
may affect

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,520
our ability to sort of be digitally

00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:00,400
sovereign to

00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:02,400
to stay in their own vernacular

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,840
we also want to learn from the open

00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,640
technology fund and

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,360
we're in talks with them and the great

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,200
thing about

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,760
the open technology fund is that it

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,559
actually wants to be copied

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,679
the entire basically operational

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,480
infrastructure of

00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,840
how the otf distributes funding is open

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,360
source itself

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:25,279
so we are able to to basically

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,799
take all the lessons that they have

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,360
learned in their operation

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:31,520
and build a european project that is

00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,000
inspired by it but maybe is funding

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,039
slightly

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,799
different projects so from the otf i

00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,520
think we have learned how important it

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,840
is that

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,000
this funding structure must not be

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,000
directly run by the government

00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,159
it's okay if money is coming from the

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,919
public hand i think that's the job of

00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,320
the public administration

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:53,039
but at the same time i think a lot of

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,600
developers are rightfully suspicious of

00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,559
government oversight and so that should

00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,279
not be

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:01,440
part of this funding structure also

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,840
there should be no expectation

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,279
of promoting the government in exchange

00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,039
for receiving this funding you're

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,760
receiving the funding because this is

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,559
something

00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,559
that is helpful to society at large and

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:15,600
not because the government wants to have

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:17,919
a good publicity it must be built also

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,080
on a network of trusted actors so the

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,880
open source community is not just sort

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,720
of

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,720
a business community or something like

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,919
that it's a culture where people know

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,760
each other and trust

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,120
individual people that they have worked

00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,080
with over years

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,320
and so whoever runs such a fund has to

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,679
be part of the free software community

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,679
to actually have

00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,200
these personal connections and be able

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,279
to build this trust

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,559
there should also be no restrictions on

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,880
the nationality

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,240
of the people who can apply and this is

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,320
something that's actually pretty

00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,799
difficult to convince governments of

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,600
that you know the german economy will

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,640
grow

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,600
if we give money to some developer in

00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,760
brazil

00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,720
who is maintaining and improving

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,960
infrastructure

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,320
that is open source i think to me this

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,080
is totally logical

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:08,840
but to a lot of governments it's not um

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:11,600
yeah and obviously there is no

00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:14,080
competition between the open technology

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,960
fund which is now thankfully continuing

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,000
under the biden administration and these

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,159
this new

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,159
european fund that we're hoping to build

00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,559
because basically

00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,640
we want to have decentralized and

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:29,039
redundant funding infrastructure

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,720
so if one of them for example shrinks

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:34,880
the other can take it off

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,880
so take take it up so i think the crisis

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,960
with the open technology fund last year

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,279
has demonstrated that it's good for

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,039
all of us to have a diverse funding

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,880
infrastructure that can talk to each

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:47,120
other that can help each other

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:49,039
and that can maybe also specialize in

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:53,279
slightly different fields

00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:56,320
so i think

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:58,320
uh that obviously the core

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,320
of the free software community are the

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,559
people who are building the software

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,440
i'm not a software developer actually

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,640
and i think

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,720
what i can contribute to the overall

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,720
ecosystem is to build a bridge between

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,840
the free software community

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,799
and public policy because well most

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,600
people in government

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,960
are also not free software developers so

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,120
i think it's great if you

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,640
continue to do the coding and i'll try

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,880
to focus on

00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,559
telling the story behind it why this is

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,360
something that politicians should care

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,240
about

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,960
and um yeah i'm hoping to do that with

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,360
like-minded activists from

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,440
the other uh organizations that i've

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,960
mentioned such as the prototype fund the

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,120
open technology fund

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,320
and also in the individual people in the

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,799
european commission

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,600
or in governments who really want to

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,880
push

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:52,720
um this open source strategy forward

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,640
um so we will try together to make

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,960
something like a european digital

00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,559
infrastructure fund or basic technology

00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,120
fund a reality

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:02,000
in the next couple of years but what is

00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,799
the most important

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,039
to us is to insist that these design

00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:07,760
features that we think are needed are

00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,480
actually

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:11,200
put in place so this means not a focus

00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,760
on like

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,240
which country you're from and which tax

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,520
id

00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:18,960
you have not a focus on

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,200
things like whether you're a big

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,880
business or an individual developer but

00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,360
what should really count is are you

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:28,559
building something that is relevant

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:31,440
for the public infrastructure

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,760
and is it released as open source and is

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,480
it

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:36,399
auditable that is really at the core of

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:40,000
what we should be funding

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:43,039
so um the goal ultimately

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
is to have eu or global funding

00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,559
structures

00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,799
but we don't want to wait for you know

00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,960
27 member state governments to

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,720
to come together and to agree on

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,720
something with the european parliament

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:57,120
but sometimes it's actually easier

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:59,120
to start something in one country and

00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,440
then if it's successful other countries

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,760
may

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,640
join it this has actually recently

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,440
happened

00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,200
with gaia x project for open cloud

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,080
infrastructure which was started in

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,080
germany

00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,919
and then france got interested in it and

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,640
now it's sort of more of a european

00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,480
project

00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,840
so this is kind of how we want to

00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,960
operate so

00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,440
um we are trying to get this off the

00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,640
ground

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,200
in germany and i'm really glad to have

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,799
support from people within the otf who

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,720
are basically saying well look

00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:31,679
everything we're doing is open source

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,880
you can copy our methodology you can

00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:35,760
copy our

00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,919
um our infrastructure our own software

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,399
that we're using to run this fund

00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,200
but i think there are many important

00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,760
areas

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,679
aside from anti-censorship and privacy

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,840
technology that also need

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,559
funds like the open technology fund and

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:51,039
for me sort of basic technologies that

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:54,080
are not

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:56,080
at the application layer are one of the

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,720
missing links that i would like to focus

00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,880
on

00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,240
but there are also other things i think

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,240
where this sort of funding

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,520
structure is needed so for example i

00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,399
could imagine

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,679
an open technology fund for government

00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:10,159
technology like government

00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,399
applications or one for open hardware

00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,799
and so on so i think there is no

00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,600
shortage of areas that would benefit

00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:18,240
from this

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,880
so hopefully in a few decades we will

00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,559
have

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,240
100 open technology funds

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:27,200
funded by different governments and

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,720
public sector players around the world

00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,640
because i don't think

00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,480
that the public infrastructure that we

00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,600
use for everything

00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,080
from school to work to the healthcare

00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,520
system

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,399
is something that we should leave

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:43,600
entirely to the responsibility of

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:45,520
private companies so um yeah what can

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,399
you do to help so at the moment this

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,039
fund does not

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,000
exist yet so that means we cannot

00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,840
actually take like

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,120
funding applications for this or

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,520
anything like this

00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:57,919
but of course do check out the prototype

00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,640
fund or the open technology fund if you

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:01,279
are building open source software that

00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,080
you think

00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:06,720
might uh fit those criteria so for the

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,240
otf primarily sort of anti-censorship

00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,559
and privacy technology

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,039
and for the prototype fund primarily

00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,399
sort of new ideas new projects that are

00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:17,279
just starting out

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:18,000
um especially in germany and yes please

00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,880
talk about

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,519
this idea write newspaper articles about

00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,200
why

00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,640
government should find open source

00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,760
software and

00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:30,480
um if you hear your politicians

00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,480
talk about digital sovereignty ask them

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,480
what they actually mean by that like do

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,559
you actually mean that we should sort of

00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,399
shut ourselves off from the rest of the

00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:41,200
world i think this is something

00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:42,080
that uh lies in europe's past and not in

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,840
its future

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,159
or do you actually mean that we should

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,440
become more resilient by having things

00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:50,080
like open source

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,960
so we become less dependent on a single

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,880
technology company for example

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,440
and please also start similar

00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,240
initiatives in your country

00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,240
ask political parties to include this

00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,559
idea in the election programs

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,559
and please also share if there are

00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:08,640
existing projects like this in your

00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:11,440
countries that we should know about

00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:14,000
and yeah hopefully uh not in not too

00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,159
distant future we will be able to share

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,279
good news about this project going ahead

00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,360
in germany

00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:21,039
i will leave it at that thank you very

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:24,000
much for your attention

00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,440
um this is where you can reach me at zen

00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,679
viking on twitter

00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:32,399
or at julia.reda okay

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,279
and yeah i look very much forward to

00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:36,080
discussing

00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,880
more of this in breakout or by email or

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,240
on twitter

00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,279
thanks a lot yeah thanks a lot julia for

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,720
your talk

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:47,760
um we actually got a few questions in um

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,519
via our platform uh maybe we can go

00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,679
through a few before you go over to the

00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,559
breakout and then people can take it

00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,360
further

00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,840
um one person asked um about the eu

00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,840
fossa

00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,360
project what were your what are your key

00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,720
learnings basically from

00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,559
this because it was the first time that

00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,760
was done right yeah

00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:07,760
um so i think the most

00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,679
important one is that you have to make

00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:13,679
it really easy to apply

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:16,559
so like the the first sort of try

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,279
of fossa where we had these this public

00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,120
tender

00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:21,200
i think that didn't work very well

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,600
because of basically

00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,039
to yeah to win a public tender from the

00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,799
eu you kind of

00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:29,279
like you don't necessarily have to be a

00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:30,000
big company but if you're an individual

00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:33,039
developer

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,679
like yeah don't even try so at the end

00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:36,080
what we

00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,799
why we decided to do bug bounties

00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,200
instead

00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:40,080
was because then we could do a public

00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,279
tender for

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:46,080
a bug bounty company and then basically

00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,039
uh um different back boundary platforms

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,799
could apply

00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,559
and they are actually able to do that

00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,640
but then we were able to actually pay

00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,000
money to individual developers which

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,399
otherwise the eu

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,039
wasn't really equipped to do but of

00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,120
course

00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:00,080
this sort of meant that we ended up

00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,519
using

00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:05,360
the form of funding because

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,519
this was the easiest to implement and

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,639
not necessarily because bug bounties are

00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,879
the best way

00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,839
to support the free software community

00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,760
so in the end

00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:16,560
we also did some other stuff like

00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,720
creating hackathons which actually

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,000
like i was a little bit skeptical if

00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:22,240
this is useful but

00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,000
in the end actually we had some good

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:27,440
feedback because some of those

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,200
um communities around like relatively

00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,079
specialized projects

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,679
are really global and they just never

00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,919
meet in person because

00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,679
it's quite expensive to fly people in

00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:39,440
from all over the world so in the end

00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,280
i'm quite happy with

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,200
with the fossa project even though it

00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,159
probably didn't change the world and it

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:46,399
was also much

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,399
smaller than the open technology fund

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:51,839
like the open technology fund

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:54,879
it gets about 20 million dollars a year

00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:56,639
so 15 million euros fossa was much

00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:58,880
smaller smaller than that it was more

00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,680
like 1 million euro a year or something

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,920
like that

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,880
but still i think it's important to

00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,839
point out that also 15 million euros

00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,480
is not a lot for the german government

00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:10,560
like

00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,760
they if they decided they wanted to do

00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,000
that they could do it

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,440
right now like this is not serious money

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:22,320
for a mid-sized country

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:24,480
yeah okay then another question

00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,760
it says funding developers has already

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,920
become more common

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,000
how do you see funding for other roles

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,920
like ux designers project

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,200
managers translators and so on that are

00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,040
also important for

00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,520
um fast projects yeah super important i

00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:40,320
mean

00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,280
um i think the otf is already doing a

00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,400
little bit of that

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,960
like for example they have um a sort of

00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,680
a professional training environment for

00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,280
improving user experience for example

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,880
but yeah i think it's a really good

00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,240
point that basically

00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,119
um funding structures should be sort of

00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,520
agnostic

00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,040
to which part of the open source

00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,720
development

00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,800
the funding should go to like the

00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,760
funding should not be reserved to the

00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,800
coding

00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,960
alone because things like you know user

00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,960
interface or translation is just

00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,520
as important for the software to be

00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,160
actually used in practice

00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,280
which is you know really important also

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,640
for the acceptance

00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,640
of open source technology

00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,599
then there is another question by

00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:30,800
someone who sends a disclaimer that it's

00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:34,079
a red hatter and says a lot

00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:36,079
fast developers are employed and it

00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,920
seems like those projects

00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,520
seem to focus more on independent

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,599
developers

00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,079
is there a way to what is the way to

00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:47,599
address that

00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:50,480
yeah i mean i guess if uh you're um

00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,520
employed and you are really free to

00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,880
basically

00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:56,560
use your work time to work on any free

00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,680
software project you want

00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:02,720
that is great but i think quite commonly

00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:06,079
um free software developers who are

00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,920
employed and who are releasing the pro

00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:10,160
products of their work as free software

00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,960
are still expected to work on specific

00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:14,480
problems

00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,960
so i think there might be um

00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,960
a bias in the kinds of open source

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,119
software that

00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,960
free software developers who are

00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,920
employed are going to focus their

00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,560
attention on

00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:28,160
and maybe it's more like developing new

00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,760
features that are needed for this

00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,040
particular company

00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,240
and maybe not so much maintaining stuff

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,320
that is really at the core

00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,560
infrastructure but again like i'm not

00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,079
a free software developer so if what i'm

00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,400
saying is totally wrong

00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,920
feel free to correct me but i think it's

00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:46,800
important to basically

00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,880
step in where the market does not

00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,839
automatically provide for the funding

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,839
that is needed

00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:58,480
okay then i think a final question

00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,720
um there are questions about having like

00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,560
an

00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:05,040
open source tax approach so um

00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,240
for example one percent tax to all

00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,960
proprietary software

00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,240
sales um and then distribute that money

00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,280
back into the

00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:15,040
open source ecosystem um

00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,800
do you think this could be a feasible

00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,440
approach um i mean

00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,599
personally i like it i just know that a

00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,560
lot of politicians get very scared when

00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,800
you approach

00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,920
when you propose tax increases like it's

00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,880
something that is

00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,560
often not very popular uh otherwise we

00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,720
would probably have it

00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,599
in more areas but personally i think

00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:37,599
this is kind of

00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,599
a a nice idea

00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:44,800
okay then let's see uh there's one

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:46,000
final question actually um more on

00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,359
germany there recently

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,880
has the um day the

00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:55,760
uh sprint sprint i think it is

00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,680
yeah the uh you know agency for

00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:00,720
innovation for leap innovation

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,040
and how is that connected to your uh to

00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,760
the

00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,640
funding of open source yeah i think i

00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:07,040
think they are

00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,720
uh really great and are really bringing

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,040
some innovative thinking

00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,119
into the german government and we have

00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:16,400
talked to them about this idea

00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,040
um i think one of the restrictions that

00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,839
also

00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,760
uh sprint is having is again this idea

00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:23,440
that it's just about innovation and i

00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,160
think you know funding innovation is

00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,400
great

00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,400
but i think we need to create sort of a

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,240
broader understanding in the german

00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,079
government that in order to have

00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,359
innovation you have to fund the basic

00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,720
technology like

00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,800
we've just learned this with the

00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,200
coronavirus you know like in order to

00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,000
have

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,680
a new vaccine you have to fund the basic

00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,560
research that gets you there

00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,200
and i think the same is true for for

00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:57,839
innovation

00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:57,839
in the tech tech sector

00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,839
