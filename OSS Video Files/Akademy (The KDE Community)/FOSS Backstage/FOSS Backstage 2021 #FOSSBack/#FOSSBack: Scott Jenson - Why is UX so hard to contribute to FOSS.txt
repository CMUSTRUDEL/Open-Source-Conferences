Title: #FOSSBack: Scott Jenson - Why is UX so hard to contribute to FOSS
Publication date: 2021-03-04
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	As a UX designer, I've tried to contribute to three FOSS projects over the last year. The results haven't been encouraging. This isn't surprising actually, UX has historically been a 'nice to have' on many programming teams. This of course, has changed drastically on modern product teams but I suggest that FOSS is still a bit behind the times.

This talk isn't meant to throw stones but to discuss the tensions and pressures facing FOSS projects today. Some of these pressures hinder UX contributions. The goal of this talk is to list these pressures and discuss ways to help eliminate them.

so thanks very much for having me this

00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:09,519
is a topic i feel really strongly about

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,960
um first of all i want to make it clear

00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,559
that um i actually asked on twitter

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,160
you know what's the right way to refer

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,800
to open source projects

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,720
and i got like eight different answers

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,320
in such a rich community and so many

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,880
ways referring to it so

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,519
whether it's foss or floss or open

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,920
source

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,880
i'm just going to go with foss for now i

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,000
just realized that there's

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,079
there's many ways to refer to this

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,440
community so um

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,600
i want to start off with the elephant in

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,920
the room and talk about the fact that

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,760
why would you ever want to listen to me

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,600
you know i work for the bad guys

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,800
you know i work for proprietary software

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,200
i worked at apple i worked at google

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,879
but the issue here is i feel like i want

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,480
to transcend

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,320
just the economic models of what we're

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,360
working on here i'm not here to talk

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,360
about money

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,559
or business process i just want to talk

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,239
about ux

00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,840
you know and where that fits in this

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,640
role and i'd like to think that those

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,960
skill sets

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,840
possibly transcend you know who you work

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,880
for

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,960
and besides you know there's to kind of

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,520
 off of pablo uh picasso

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,320
good artists borrow great artists steel

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,119
so let's

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,520
talk about what open source can steal

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,080
from

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,720
proprietary software and the goal here

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,040
is to say

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,920
talk about as much of ux that makes

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,520
sense for open source projects the

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,000
reason why i'm here though is that

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,520
despite my past i have been trying very

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,320
hard to be an open source

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,320
software over the last couple years i

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,520
volunteered on multiple projects

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,520
and honestly it didn't go very well

00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,640
and it really kind of made me wonder

00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,200
like what's going on

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,880
why is it so hard to contribute to

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,360
overcast projects

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,280
and so that's what this you know me

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,680
struggling to help foss

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,439
is about figuring out how we can make it

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,399
better how can we grow as a community

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,600
and so this talk

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,880
is an exploration ux

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,640
is often about having reuser research

00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,079
i was a user of research on this project

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,600
you know doing a prototype

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,599
this talk is a prototype and then doing

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,360
a user test and this talk

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,120
is your reaction will be you know the

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,959
results of this user study so this is a

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,239
prototype talk i'm just trying to see

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,560
what works

00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,319
i'm absolutely positive that because i'm

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,120
not well entrenched in the open source

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,959
community

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,360
i will probably put my foot in my mouth

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,520
and say something incorrectly so please

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,800
when i make a mistake uh please don't

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,400
assume the worst

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,319
assume that my heart is in the right

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,560
place and if i do misstep

00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,920
uh correct me and let's work together

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,640
and work on this so

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,840
i'm trying to help here um the first

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,400
assumption though

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,360
is that um i'm talking about open source

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,879
projects that need

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,480
ux help um there's obviously a wide

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,200
variety of open source projects and

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,800
they not they don't all need ux help but

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,680
things like libreoffice

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,760
or or you know anything that has a

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,920
very strong consumer-facing

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,800
type of interface is the kind of project

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,040
that we're talking about here um

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,480
and like i said before this is meant to

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,239
be a discussion i'm not here to bring

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,519
you the tablets from the mountain to say

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,280
you must do this

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,720
it's more like let's let's see what we

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,080
can do here to make these projects a

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,519
little bit better

00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,200
the second assumption is that i'm not

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,480
going to name the names of the projects

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,480
i had so much trouble with i don't

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,480
believe in naming and shaming

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:28,239
i just want to uh use the examples

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,760
and see how we can kind of improve those

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,200
those specifics

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,280
so uh the my first try

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,480
um about a year and a half ago two years

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,480
ago roughly i

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,920
approached a uh open source project it

00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,920
looked like it needed some help

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,080
and i was a bit frustrated that there

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,959
was no mention of ux there are no ux

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,120
tasks

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,120
there was literally nothing for me to do

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,599
i searched for the issues

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,159
and so my first point was there was just

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,920
no

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:58,720
hook i just didn't know what i could do

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,959
so being not wanting to give up i just

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,400
posted an issue you know just saying hey

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,480
i'm a ux designer

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,560
how can i help and i got a very

00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,280
enthusiastic reply very quickly which is

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,040
like hey

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,040
so glad you're here we need icons

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,959
and when i tell i've told this story now

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,439
to a couple of uf designers and i always

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,040
get a

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:21,759
laugh from because apparently that's all

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,720
anyone ever wants on these projects is

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,040
just icons

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,680
it's about the universal ask for any ux

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,479
designer that approaches any project

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,320
and it's like really you know i mean i'm

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,400
happy to do icons

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,759
good icons are actually really hard

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,600
there's actually a subspecialty of

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,120
visual design that

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,639
really does a great job at this but it's

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,040
a lot of work but

00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,400
my point is there's so many more things

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,520
that ux is about

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,000
icons is like the last on the list

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,520
and it's a little bit like if you were a

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,160
programmer for example just to

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,840
give you perspective what if the only

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,800
thing people talk to you about was unit

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,639
tests

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,560
i mean unit tests are important i mean

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,759
you need to do them but if that's the

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,360
only thing that you're asked is like

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,759
what there's so much more to talk about

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,160
and

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,840
that's the feeling i'm trying to convey

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,400
is that icons are fine

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,919
but can we broaden the scope of the

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,520
conversation a little bit

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:17,680
i'd like to use this idea of icons as my

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,120
organization tactic for the whole talk

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,840
because icons

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,639
represent i think the core issue about

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,639
ux and

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,720
foss and why it's not working that well

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,720
so i have three parts to this talk

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,400
can we expand the definition of what ux

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,840
is so there's a little bit more than

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,479
just icons

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,360
can we talk about the tools that foss

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,520
uses

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,639
that maybe prevents us talking more

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,240
about ux

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,000
and can we have a little talk about the

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,720
culture

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,039
and and how all three of these overlap

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,880
so

00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,560
the only thing that's really possible

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,960
right now is icons

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,400
and the idea is i want to use this talk

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,160
to say can we give

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,759
things a nudge can we just push these a

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,280
little bit so these move a little bit

00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,800
closer together so we have a

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,280
broader range of things that we can do

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,639
so on each of these topics i'm going to

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,479
have a summary slide

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,479
and the goal is to say you know let's

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,160
talk about what's happening today

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,600
and can we push things to be a little

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,840
bit better tomorrow

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:19,199
and because of my somewhat

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,000
newness to the foss community i may say

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,080
something's a little bit too

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,919
strong um i mean i can't kind of get

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,600
them right but let's talk about this

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,440
line between what we're doing today

00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,840
review tomorrow so let's talk about what

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,319
ux is

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,960
if there's one word that summarizes the

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,600
goal of ux to me if there's one word i

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,560
want

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,919
non-ux people to understand it's

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,120
perspective

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,840
the whole goal of ux and all the tasks

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,880
that we do

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,600
is to give teams perspective what is

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,680
important

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,360
what should we be focusing on is you

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,720
know that what do what do users need

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,680
so we focus on these three basic things

00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,280
users who are they how do we understand

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,080
them how do we describe them

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,039
what are their tasks not what are the

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,880
features

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,160
what are their tasks what are they

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,759
trying to do

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,440
and then of course when they actually

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,919
use your software

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,800
what is their pain those are the

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,039
fundamental

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,639
organizing motivating type things that

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,639
ux takes care of

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,560
and by doing these it gives us a lot of

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,080
vocabulary to discuss

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,639
now i have to quote the cathedral in the

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,240
bazaar and i realize it's a very old

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,759
document and i understand that many of

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,440
you have moved well past it

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,280
but it was kind of the document that

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,720
kind of established a lot of these

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,479
founding principles

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,960
and this is a quote that i took from it

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,039
treating your users as co-developers

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,440
is your least hassle route for rapid

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,319
code development and effective debugging

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,280
and honestly whenever a ux person reads

00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,000
this

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,199
it's just we just want to cry you know

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,879
it is just such a

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:56,479
frustrating thing about how to

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,960
um about how

00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,560
things work because the bottom line the

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,319
fundamental thing that has been kind of

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,879
seared into our souls

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,240
is that we aren't the typical users i

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,120
understand that having

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,919
developers be the users is the least

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,960
hassle way

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,879
but it's not the most effective route to

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,120
figure out what your users need

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,120
and so it's just this and i'm not saying

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,440
that you aren't your typical users i'm

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,319
saying

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,440
i'm not the typical user either and it's

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,160
kind of one of the

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,960
most critical things to understand about

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,160
ux

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,399
is that while open source community uses

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,240
this technique to get people to come in

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,240
we need to figure out ways of expanding

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,719
our way of thinking about that

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,080
and i use these four basic structures to

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,000
talk about what ux

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,519
is and how we talk about this

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,399
understanding bridging

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,680
flowing and refining and each of these

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,680
has tasks

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,360
that are meant to fill it in so

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,240
understanding means to understand the

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,360
users

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,640
user tests focus groups surveys

00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,320
interviews personas they're all have

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,240
almost nothing to do

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,320
with the product and everything about

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,640
the users and what they're doing

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,000
the bridging is when you try to take

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,640
that understanding of users

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,320
and bridge it to the current technology

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,279
for example people that are doing

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,120
taxes might have a lot of paper tasks

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:19,600
organization tasks and so forth

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,120
as opposed to the actual tax tax

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,519
calculations themselves

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,680
the software may only worry about a tiny

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,200
piece of their overall tasks

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,720
and it's important to say well what can

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,720
the technology do what can't the

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,360
technology do what will be easy will be

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,120
hard

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,720
and that's a very moment of humility for

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,120
teams because you

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,080
you would admit that you're not actually

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,839
solving

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,920
all of their problems it's just the

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,240
piece that you can handle

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,240
then the flowing is about basically

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,680
stitching things together

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,800
how do users flow through your product

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,839
there's a lot of discussion in the

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,800
design community about ux versus ui

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,360
my definition is that ui is snapshots in

00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,839
time

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,079
like each individual screen and ux is

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:05,200
about what connects the screens together

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:07,440
the time as you just flow through it

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,240
but this includes paper mock-ups ux

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,720
mock-ups motion studies and journey maps

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,920
and this is the overall journey that

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,200
your user is taking

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,440
through it and then of course there's

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,880
the final step which is the actual

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,800
building of the product

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,399
design systems color themes animations

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,920
copywriting style guides and yes

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,360
finally those damn icons so my point is

00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,600
to say that there is a ton

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,360
of stuff that ux is doing and of course

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,160
icons at the very very bottom of the

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,920
list

00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,200
and what we're trying to discuss here

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,480
today is how do we

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,600
fit these other tasks into open source

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,040
software

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,399
because all these things are trying

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,399
together is to create a shared

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,279
vocabulary

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,480
and so what i'm the summary point i

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,640
guess i want to leave you with here

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,920
is that there tends to be from what i've

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,560
seen uh

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,120
a belief amongst a lot of people in open

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,959
source

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,800
that i am the user the people that are

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,480
actually developing the product

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,079
and what ux is trying to do is to

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,920
discover the user

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,360
ux gathers the right information to

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,440
prototype and test

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,040
shared decisions and that's what i'd

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,079
like us to do more of

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,720
so moving on to my second point tools

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,160
there's the classic uh american phrase

00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,360
which i believe translates to europe

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,399
quite well is you know give a man a

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,720
hammer and every

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,720
problem looks like a nail and of course

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,279
the hammer i'm referring to here is git

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,440
now a ton has been written about git um

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,200
i will admit i personally despise

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,880
get from the ux point of view but that's

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,399
not my point i don't want to criticize

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,440
git on the specifics

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,440
it's more about what git is trying to do

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,120
um all of those things i talked about

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,160
before understanding bridging flowing

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,680
and refining

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,279
are all effectively part of this

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,839
research loop of research

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,200
prototyping discussion and you generate

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,320
all sorts of things

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,880
uh flow diagrams sticky notes meeting

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,440
notes

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,399
uh you know so there's a huge social

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,880
construct

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:59,360
that kind of goes around this and yet

00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,839
what is the primary tool of open source

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,399
it's get we are checking in files right

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,120
and it just

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,440
seems to just block out i mean git is

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,079
for

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,079
code there's no denying that it doesn't

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,760
capture the richness that tends to be

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,839
what ux is doing

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,000
so in a sense icons are very

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,160
understandable they are the closest

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,200
ux deliverable to code that we've got so

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,680
of course

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,079
teams want them i don't criticize teams

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,160
for wanting icons i get it

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,360
my point is that foss right now is only

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,320
asking for the work that

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,000
fits their workflow and my challenge is

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,200
to how do we expand the workflow a

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,320
little bit

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,240
now there's one more point i want to

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,720
make about tools because i made a second

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,440
attempt

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,639
with a different team about trying to do

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,399
something so i i

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,240
was able to convince the team that i was

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,639
working on to do a motion study

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,680
big win awesome i did the motion study

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,519
proposed it

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,120
checked it into an issue and the first

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,399
response i got was

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,680
oh if you're going to do this i'm going

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,120
to leave a project to not work on

00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,800
anymore

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,800
and i was a little surprised by that and

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,120
i've told this story a few times and i

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,079
get a big laugh because apparently this

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,120
type of

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,760
drama is not uncommon in open source

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,480
and and i don't want to get into online

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,880
culture

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,880
and discuss that type of thing that's a

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,279
well beyond the scope of my talk

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,800
my point is more about the tools and how

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:20,240
they impact us

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,639
because git issues isn't the same as a

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,680
team

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,240
discussion so much of what we produce in

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,720
ux

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,680
requires discussion and team

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,560
understanding

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,160
and collaboration and all i'm saying is

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,760
that git issues

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,120
isn't always the best tool to do that

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,800
i hope that's not a controversial

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,639
statement i'm just pointing out maybe

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,800
the obvious point that we need to have a

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:46,079
better way for sometime coordinating

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,279
um the the newspeak was a term i love

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,560
using from 1984

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:50,480
about a controlled language of

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,079
simplified grammar and restricted

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,360
vocabulary designed to limit the

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,680
individual's ability to think and

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,720
articulate concepts

00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:01,839
and i feel like the in a sense

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,839
a text only chat room is a little bit

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,120
like newspeak it basically forces us

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,000
into this very narrow way of

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,040
communicating

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,560
and it limits nuance and social you know

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,079
how we can talk to each other

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,360
and so i'm just saying is i just want to

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,880
acknowledge the fact that even though

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,720
we're disparate teams across different

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,040
time zones and maybe

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,000
issues is the only way to talk it has a

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,760
cost

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,440
so my conclusion on this point is that

00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,519
there's this tyranny of ascii

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,519
with open source it's all about text

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,320
files and text discussion

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,279
and i understand i get it i'm not

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,959
critical of it

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,199
well i mean maybe a little critical of

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,160
it but i'm saying how do we move beyond

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,320
that because

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,360
ux is about diagrams and discussion and

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,920
post-it notes

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,440
most companies have war rooms for ux we

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,120
put all of your stuff on the wall

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,600
with post-it notes and comments and

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,519
people flow through it's a vibrant

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,800
active social setting and by having

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,040
everything up on the walls

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,320
you can see it all now i realize that

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,079
online things

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,600
online programs don't necessarily do all

00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,720
of that i'm just pointing out the

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,199
culture

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,000
and we have a culture in ux of war rooms

00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,279
how do we get

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,079
a piece of that into open source my last

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,399
point is

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,760
foss culture and the issue here is again

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,880
cathedral and bizarre which is the

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,639
second point is

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,040
every good work of software starts by

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,040
scratching a developer's personal itch

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,160
and i get that and i think an awful lot

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,839
of projects are really small and you

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,440
need every maintainer you can

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,360
if they can come in to scratch it it's

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,399
good for them but it creates this kind

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,399
of bottom-up

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,160
thing that creates i think a little bit

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,759
of tension and it can create a little

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,560
bit of chaos

00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,000
and so it because it tends to be this

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,079
culture of a bunch of individuals

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,720
working together

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,160
uh too often i think that a lot of

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,880
technical people assume that ux

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,959
designers just want to tell you no

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,399
and there's this assumption that we're

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,000
like these bad guys that just want to

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,519
shut you down

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,519
that's not what we're trying to do and

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,600
this comes from this top down

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,560
mentality that seems to be anathema to

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,360
the bottom up

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,320
of open source u.s designers don't want

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,320
to top down

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,639
to mean that what we're talking about is

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,800
more like ux is like a cfo

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,320
you know this is probably a bad analogy

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,079
for open source

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,160
maybe i should be using cfos an example

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:13,279
but the idea is that the ceo

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:15,360
knows finance well but he trusts the cfo

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,440
to do a lot of finance tasks for him

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,880
the cfo does data collection presents

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,199
information to the ceo

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,079
and then the ceo understands what the

00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,199
cfo's doing

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,600
and he makes that decision ux is best

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,279
done

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:31,600
in this model where the ux is in

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:33,040
service to the project lead we do all

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,639
this data collection we present a lot of

00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,120
choices but the product lead

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,480
actually makes the final decision but

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,920
the pres but the project lead has to

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,920
understand ux

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,000
that's the point i'm trying to make here

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:46,880
is that it works best if

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,360
both sides understand um how this works

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,440
because

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,959
what you get of course when you have

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,880
this type of situation

00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,839
is and again probably to quote someone

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,279
that maybe doesn't have a lot of

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,440
traction in open source communities

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,920
steve jobs his quote which i think

00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,920
resonates here is real artists ship

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,120
and what we mean and the critical part

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,400
of a real order ship

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,079
is that the fact you have to say no

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,079
and saying no i think is one of the

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,240
critical skills that open source needs

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,640
because you have such limited resources

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,919
you can't do everything but saying no

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,160
requires

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,160
perspective and that's what we're trying

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,280
to figure out how to do and ux is one

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,679
tool you have

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,039
to have that vocabulary to be able to

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,559
make the hard choices to take your

00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,600
limited resources and get them out the

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,080
door

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,559
so no is only possible if the entire

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,120
team gets ux and that's part of my plea

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,799
here

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,960
i don't want to be the guy on the

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,760
outside checking in some random thing

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,080
for your team

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,360
to talk about and get issues and

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,440
misunderstand

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,480
this has to be a team effort and this

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,000
goes beyond

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,160
a pusher you know you know a pull

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,760
request

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:54,320
so in my final point here is to say

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:57,280
i want to get away from this potential

00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:00,240
culture of my opinion versus our goals

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,679
when we move to a culture of our goals

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,480
all the decisions become a lot more

00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,160
transparent

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,919
they become a lot more clear and

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,480
everybody can kind of support each other

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,679
and get more done that's my plea here so

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,679
here are the three

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,280
thing points in my talk and i want to

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,640
leave you with three possible things

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,640
that you can do

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,840
so for as far as what is you act and

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,880
again this is back in the

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,919
the the spirit of good artists borrowing

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,480
great art of steel

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,840
the first one is to to do a user study

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,679
you don't have to do it

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,520
put it in your issues put it on the in

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,520
your your your github

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,799
so that users know so that anybody who

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,039
comes like me

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,120
if you say we need to use our study that

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,679
will be a beacon that will draw people

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,120
to you

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,960
and i'm pretty sure you'll get people do

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,080
it for you now there's issues right now

00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,640
with kovid but

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,280
i'm thinking more in the future the team

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,200
sport

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,559
i'm sure your project has a list of

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,679
things you need to get done

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,960
put ux priorities on that list it's a

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,240
critical part of your document that

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,840
should be shared with the team

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,320
and it'll force you guys to talk and

00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,440
prioritize what three ux things you need

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,760
to get done this year

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,840
that's a great tool to also put on your

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,960
github to draw people in

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,679
and finally break out of list

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,039
discussions and discuss this over vc i

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,640
understand this could be hard for some

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,120
teams especially if you're in

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,840
large times and differences but break

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,080
out of that

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,120
have more social interaction meet

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,000
face-to-face or

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,440
zoom you know you know vc to vc so that

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
you can you can have

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,520
stronger bonding and more communication

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,440
outside of just raw ascii

00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,200
i think each of these are small steps

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,640
that hopefully will nudge your team to

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,799
get more ux done

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,840
but keep in mind i'm i'm wrapping up my

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,960
last slide here i'm just here to start a

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,000
discussion my goal here is to kind of

00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,919
give you guys

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,679
these suggestions about culture and how

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,120
we can move it and i

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,880
really want to encourage you to go into

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,600
the chat the the backstage room

00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,120
afterwards

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,799
and let's talk about this and figure out

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,720
what our next steps we can do

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:53,919
so thank you very much i really want to

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,280
thank toby legal and

00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,799
neon dietrich for helping me on this

00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:01,440
talk so thank you very much

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,720
great thank you so much uh scotland that

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,840
was really interesting actually and

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,039
um i hope as someone who describes

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,720
themselves as a

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,960
outsider you fail welcome here at

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,159
frostbackstage um today

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,080
um we have a question um

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,840
and i would encourage um anyone else who

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,880
has them please write them into the chat

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,159
or the question tab and i will ask scott

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,720
your questions

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,320
so the first one is um you mentioned

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,360
that ux culture

00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:32,000
is also very much silicon valley culture

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,520
do you think uh there is a way to create

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,240
fast ux culture

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,480
what might that look like distributed

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,520
and

00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,799
consensus-oriented decision-making

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:44,000
working in the open

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:48,400
volunteer driven etc

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,760
well i i hope that today is an example

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,840
of that culture

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:56,960
i am possibly naively coming in

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:59,840
and explaining what i want to have and

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,039
i expect that the people that have been

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,919
this for a long time

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:06,320
will say well i like that scott i don't

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:09,840
like that let me know what can we do

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:12,000
and so to me that is

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,919
this is the first step i hope of many

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,679
i'm also frankly hoping to find

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,799
like-minded people

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,240
there's obviously a group here called

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,720
open source design i'm anxious to talk

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,840
to them

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,480
and to see what's going on and to start

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,840
building up

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,080
best practices and then frankly showcase

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,360
successes sometimes we just need a

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,120
couple of design

00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,039
studies to say oh look at here's a team

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,200
that did it let's celebrate them

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,640
so i'm hoping that we can have lots of

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,679
ways and in further conferences like

00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,919
this

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,720
so for example i've taught i've gone to

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,000
a couple of

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,400
uh open source uh workshops or or

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,280
uh conferences and often ux is even

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,960
listed

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:51,440
so let's just let's let's just get

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,559
people to use the word ux a few times

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,960
and see where we go

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,880
yeah yeah definitely and that's yeah a

00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,600
great plug for the um

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,039
ux workshop that's um taking place at

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,640
the moment actually so if anyone is

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,720
interested in that they can

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,360
head over to the workshop space um

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,120
that's the ux workshop being um held by

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,600
the open source design collective and

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,159
they

00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,760
can help you with any questions about ux

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:17,360
that you have at the moment

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:20,640
um does anyone else have any questions

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:21,600
um yeah i'll give you a second to write

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,280
any down

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,440
um it made me think when you when you

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,559
were talking about the um

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,320
some of the things that you noticed

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,720
about uh the way that this design is

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,120
done

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,760
you were talking about the um the wall

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,520
room

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,039
you know in this design you know putting

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,880
up sticky notes and

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:39,039
and looking at things together and

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,799
working on that um

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,240
i think one of the things that is is

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,919
quite often uh

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,280
takes place in like the frost community

00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,360
is that things are asynchronous

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,799
people are working in different time

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,720
zones in different places and so

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:55,760
it's it's quite difficult to um

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,760
foster that kind of uh yes this war room

00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,559
idea i mean do you have any ideas for

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,280
how how people can do that well i think

00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,799
step one

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,640
is to just appreciate that there are

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,960
things beyond you know

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,080
text type posts so for example i

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,640
mentioned i did a motion

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,440
study um just getting teams to

00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,440
understand

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,640
that there are us deliverables outside

00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,360
of icons and

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,320
um and you know just textual lists of

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,360
features

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:24,320
um so you know use the tools we have

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,919
so it's amazing how much an animated gif

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,280
has become the lingua franca for a lot

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,679
of ux discussion

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,559
so start by posting images and

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,840
animations

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:35,120
into issues because and and and and try

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,400
to get as much as you can within the

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:40,240
existing tool

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:42,480
um that being said um

00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,840
let's start with the teams that can do

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,480
this in other words

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,279
um yes it may be hard but can we have a

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,720
few you know

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:52,159
vc kind of discussions across time zones

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,320
now if you're completely all over the

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,520
world i get it but not all teams are

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,120
going to be that way

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,799
uh the other one might be to say well

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,080
can we have some small teams you know

00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,159
maybe it's better to take

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,840
two or three people put them on put them

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,440
together and they do their own mini worm

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,559
because two or three people as possible

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,880
and then post it up so that actually i

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,960
think

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,200
is the hardest question i raised today

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,400
because i'm glad you called it out

00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,039
because there are no real good virtual

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:21,679
war room type software type things

00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,640
you know what i will say is there are

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,600
whiteboard

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,279
there's whiteboard type software and

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,080
maybe we can talk about having virtual

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,159
whiteboards

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,360
to at least get all of our stuff up on a

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,880
single whiteboard

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,480
and then start to do comments so i'd

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,159
love to experiment with that

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,600
okay great um i have a few more

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,120
questions for you from the audience

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:44,000
um so um your talk about um

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,640
you talk about consensus uh where the ux

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:50,559
designer and the products lead

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:52,880
in open source world maintainers lead

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,159
where they both understand ux this is

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,200
hard it takes time

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,200
is there any suggestions

00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,120
i completely agree it is hard and it

00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:04,159
does take time

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,919
um just you know one of the things i

00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,400
learned as a consultant is to say you

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,520
know

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,880
what's the cost if you don't do it and i

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,320
would argue that if you don't get

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,400
consensus it's even

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:20,080
harder so that's your alternative

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,840
so especially given

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,440
my brief experience with the way

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:27,600
conversations unfold

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,880
in some chat room in some issues

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,039
part of the reason why i actually

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,559
encourage vc conversations is that i

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,360
think it naturally makes

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:37,200
people a little bit more civil um so

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,480
there is that a discussion so

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,240
uh what i would start with though is um

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,760
you know community guidelines you know

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,039
how people work that's becoming much

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,520
more commonplace

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,679
um and a culture that really reinforces

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,919
it so when someone crosses that line

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,120
uh we call them out to say hey you know

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,559
that's not how we work here

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:59,360
you know um and and really

00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,480
start the community guidelines come from

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,240
the top and so you have to make sure

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,480
that the maintainer and the organizers

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,279
are the ones that say guys you know

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,960
we're a group

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:09,120
we're doing this together you know

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,440
here's the ux documents that we have

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,640
that

00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,880
establish what we're trying to

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:17,600
accomplish these are our priorities

00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:19,360
and um but honestly let's let's be clear

00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:22,240
i think i'm waving my hands a little bit

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,080
i think i just know what i want i'm not

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,679
exactly sure how to get it

00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,200
and i expect frankly that there are

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,919
people much more accomplished in this

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,200
than i am

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,360
and i'd like to encourage them to come

00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,840
into the conversation as well to say

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,600
let's really flag this as a high

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,320
priority and let's really work on it

00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,240
because

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,600
i don't have all the answers on this

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,039
okay cool um

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,799
we have a time for another couple of

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:46,000
quick questions so

00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:48,880
um someone asks um is this primarily

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,960
around applications versus desktop the

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,760
desktop has a different sociopolitical

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,000
scene than applications

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,440
that's interesting because i think of

00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,480
applications as being

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:03,600
mobile or desktop

00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,080
i'm not quite sure i see the dichotomy i

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,279
will

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:10,320
offers a counter that i would say it's

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,799
kind of more end user focused whether

00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,080
it's

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,840
because because there's an awful lot of

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,360
tools that are developer focused that

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,440
are only for developers or

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,320
there's an awful lot of open source

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,679
projects that are like drivers well

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,120
i don't think there's no there's no

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,399
necessarily need for discussion at that

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,480
particular point

00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,760
so um is there is there any

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,200
clarification to make sure i'm answering

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,399
the question properly

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,399
um no i haven't

00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:36,000
um because i i would just say that as

00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,760
long as there's an end user i don't care

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,440
whether it's desktop or mobile or web i

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:42,799
would i would i would put them all in

00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:46,000
the same category from ux point of view

00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,640
okay and uh one final question um let me

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,480
read this

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,840
um don't you think that ux is just

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,279
telling people what they should

00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:17,840
