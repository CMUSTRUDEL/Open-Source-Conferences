so hi

00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,320
uh my name is denise cooper and i am

00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,960
the president and founder of the

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,080
undersource commons and this talk is the

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,679
beginning of

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,920
a talk i'll probably give several times

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,359
this year about some of the lessons that

00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,800
i learned from building inner source

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,680
commons so it's kind of a meta

00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,480
conversation

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,160
about incenting people to join an effort

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,080
like inner source commons and

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,320
i think it's applicable to pretty much

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,079
any open source community

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,000
i have done a lot of consulting to

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,079
companies trying to build community

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,079
behind their open source projects

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,840
and it's sort of the same steps so here

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,000
we go

00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,600
so first of all why the pirates and why

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,600
is that picture so blurry

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,600
because it's a really tiny picture it

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,399
was it was taken with a

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,120
probably an insta camera at some point

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,719
in the 70s that is steve jobs

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,879
on the left and john scully on the right

00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,199
and behind them is the famous pirate

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:04,960
flag with the apple for one eye

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,960
that steve had made and hoisted

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,000
over the building where the macintosh

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,880
was created

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,159
and they they really espoused a pirate

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,479
ethic

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,520
in silicon valley we talk a lot about

00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,840
skunk works

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,280
and how you you have to take any

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,880
innovative idea

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,960
out of the middle of the company and

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,640
give it its own little breathing space

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,479
because the antibodies inside the

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,119
company will kill it otherwise

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,079
and that is sort of also true of inner

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,759
source i think

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,079
it's definitely true of open source

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,479
efforts if it's the only thing

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,240
that's open source in your huge company

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,880
it's got to be at the edge and it's got

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,119
to be

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,280
protected now because inner source is

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,040
about changing the core of the company

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,880
at the end of the day it's got to get to

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,200
the middle but it doesn't have to start

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,240
there

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,680
it can start with a seed or an

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,320
experiment as i've written

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,920
in several books now that help you

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,079
figure out where you're going

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,200
well we kind of did the the commons the

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,520
same way

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,200
um we actually started talking about

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,799
inner source at oscon

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,479
in 2015 i gave a keynote and um

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,039
that was us admitting that we were

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,200
starting to experiment with it

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,120
at the time it was a gutsy thing to do

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,599
because people like me had been saying

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,440
no

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,800
to internal open source for a really

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,959
long time

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,000
because it didn't create more public

00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,319
code but

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,239
i came to a point in my consultancy

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,680
after 20 years of working in open source

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,959
i was starting to see

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,280
that we were losing momentum because we

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,840
didn't have

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,360
any more companies looking for

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,040
engagement with open source that could

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,800
get there on their own because they had

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,400
cultural impediments

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,120
i think the situation's a little bit

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,720
better today now that now that

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,319
we've talked about inner source and

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,519
people realize that community building

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,519
is its own art

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,680
learning to collaborate can be done

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,800
inside your company in a way that's also

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,120
additive to the

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,720
to the whole anyway these are the

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,200
lessons that i learned

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,760
at least some of them first of all i

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,720
learned

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,480
that good ideas don't need to die but

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,040
they have to wait their time

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,640
the intersource was actually invented in

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,680
the year 2000

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,000
but it couldn't work as an

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,280
effort until open source won in the

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,840
minds of the public

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,400
because it was just too easy to discount

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,440
it

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,280
when people came along to you know

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,239
there's always push back against any

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,959
change

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,959
and uh the middle management especially

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,760
of companies were getting in the way and

00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,000
sometimes

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,879
the most senior engineers also kind of

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,519
getting in the way

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,360
of this forward progress away from

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,799
excessive ownership culture

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,959
so it had to wait until open source one

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,560
and companies got hungry to figure out

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,080
how to build software

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,680
in the same way and so you know

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,360
keep an eye on the good ideas that

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,959
didn't quite make it over the finish

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,799
line because you might find them useful

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,280
again later

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,200
second thing you are what you measure

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,760
and what i'm saying there is

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,720
really you don't want to go overboard on

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,439
measurement

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,280
when you're trying to first understand

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,040
what's going on in your culture and

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,439
why it's difficult to get people to

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,599
collaborate when you do your first

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,479
couple of experiments you you really

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,280
can't

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,880
go all in on metrics and if you're in a

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,120
company where metrics are a big deal

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,120
this can be a bit of a struggle

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,040
um when i say you are what you measure

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,880
you can use which metrics your

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,680
you're using to push behavior

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,400
so for instance if you're getting and

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,479
this happens

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,080
to everybody at first if people are

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,680
holding on to their code too long

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,440
because they're not comfortable

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,600
giving it over to be read by somebody

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,600
else there so they're over polishing

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,600
and then they drop 30 000 lines on a

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,960
poor trusted committer who has no time

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,000
to do a good job of

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,880
reviewing the code um that's obviously a

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,800
broken thing

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,000
you have to convince them to release

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,680
early and often

00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,120
and one of the ways to do that is

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,560
announce far and wide that you're going

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,400
to start measuring number of pull

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,199
requests and i promise you there'll be a

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,560
lot more of them

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,800
and they'll be smaller so

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,600
metrics can be your friend but you want

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,680
to wait

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,680
to apply really deep metrics until you

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,400
have a good idea of which behaviors

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,400
you're trying to change

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,840
next thing change agents are born not

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,840
made

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,680
this little girl is about to do a death

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,720
defying thing

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,400
and and the the people like her

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,720
when their children are gonna be

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,479
reasonable change agents i think

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,479
um there are a lot of people who want to

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,919
engage in change agency that have no

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,720
business doing it because it'll make

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,600
them miserable

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,199
as individuals people like to shoot the

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,600
messenger when you're trying to change

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,840
things and what i learned was it's

00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,199
possible to mitigate this effect

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,360
if you educate people about what

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,560
it is that they need to think about

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,639
before they

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,600
push their career in this direction

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,600
that's helped us

00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:02,080
find some really hard working

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,880
serious change agents in the intersource

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,240
commons

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,560
and they are some of the people that

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,000
have stayed involved in the foundation

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,840
and are helping to grow it

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,360
because they want to see the change that

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,080
we've been talking about spread

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,520
all across engineering and they realize

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,840
that they need allies

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,280
but i realized that not everybody who

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,199
comes through the door of inner source

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,199
commons is one of those people

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,199
and that's okay not everybody has to be

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,160
that but there have to be a few of them

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,000
and um so i have some methods now for

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,199
how to tell or how to help people do

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,240
that assessment

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,479
and we'll maybe start submitting

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,160
uh that tutorial again to conferences

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,520
now that inner source has gained some

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,319
steam we did it like

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,160
half a dozen times um a few years ago

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,680
and it was always really popular but

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,240
but we should probably start doing it

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,280
again okay

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,840
preparation is key to scaling and this

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,319
is the

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,840
chinese olympics which had thousands of

00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,680
people doing amazing things

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,360
but the reason i picked this picture is

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,759
because this woman

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,720
looks like if you just saw the stage

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,240
level of her

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,319
she looks like she's doing everything on

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,599
her own but she has thousands of people

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,759
under her

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,599
the truth is the kind of people that

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,000
inner source appeals to

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,560
are not the kind of people who know how

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,160
to communicate effectively inside a

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:22,160
company typically

00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,400
so we do a little seed experiment and

00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,360
they prove to themselves and to their

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,880
management that

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,880
open source is going to or inner source

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,000
is going to work and in some cases that

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,840
it's going to be a necessary

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,120
stepping stone to get to open source

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,479
which is the whole reason i started

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,479
talking about it

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,560
but then somebody in the upper

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,080
management will say this is a great idea

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,680
thank you for showing us how it's done

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,639
now tell everybody else in the company

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,240
how to do it

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,520
and those people that originally got

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:50,160
interested in this method go oh

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,680
or sometimes they might say in asked

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,759
like they're not ready

00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,520
for for that kind of communication they

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,680
don't have the chops

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,360
that's not what they're good at so what

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,039
i advise companies

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,960
do is get communicators involved and

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,360
interested in inner source within the

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,520
company as soon as it's showing promise

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,400
maybe even while the first seat is being

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,639
set up

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,680
so that they can start looking for the

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,199
storyline

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,280
that's going to be compelling throughout

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,479
the whole organization because that is

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,039
the hardest thing to do

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,520
and it is different per culture steve

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,599
jobs knew how to do that for his team

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,440
building the mac but it didn't wouldn't

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,160
have worked for everybody at apple

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,960
he was doing a special thing the problem

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,719
is

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,320
the people that want to do inner source

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,080
tend to be the special people

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,599
and then they have to infect the rest of

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,719
the company with

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,159
the success of this endeavor russ

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,440
rutledge who you saw earlier

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,480
is super good at figuring out what value

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,040
was just created

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,640
in whatever stage of the process he's at

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,440
and then broadcasting that back to

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,440
management

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,720
but that's not the same as getting every

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,399
engineer on

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,640
your side and he's had to figure out

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,279
ways to do that within his culture too

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,120
so this is a big lesson preparation is

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,680
the key to scaling you've got to start

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,519
early

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,040
if you're expecting the whole company to

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,120
do this

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,720
and then my last big takeaway for this

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,760
talk although i have some illustrative

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,640
points still in

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,560
future slides is just like open source

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,160
inner source and air source commons is

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,160
made out of people

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,080
these are people at the last summit that

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,000
we did if you look carefully you'll see

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,600
an awful lot of asian faces that's

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,800
because the summit was

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,560
pointed towards um asia pacific and

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,720
you know down in a time zone that was

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,240
comfortable for that part of the world

00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,839
um it was the largest summit we've had

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,680
so far more than a thousand people

00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,399
attended this is just a little piece of

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,160
that

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,440
but i have learned a lot in my whole

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,480
open source career

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,120
that i've been applying to this issue of

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,320
inner sources people and these are

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,720
things that any

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,240
open source effort could could benefit

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,200
from as well so i'll go through them

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,959
quickly

00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,839
um so the first one is as a leader

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,160
you've got to check your ego at the door

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,839
i

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:08,480
i worked for 20 years pushing my ego out

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,440
as a personification of the future of

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,279
open source

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,480
there were a handful of us that traveled

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,440
around the world

00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,079
talking to governments and companies and

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,800
schools

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,480
individuals to push this idea of the

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,560
future of open source

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,240
that's not the only piece of the puzzle

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,480
that got open source over the line but

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,519
it was a big piece of the puzzle i think

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,560
and and that was about pushing ego

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,279
but to build a community that you hope

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,880
will

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:39,200
will last after you're done because i'll

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,680
retire at some point coming up here

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,560
um you have to do a different thing you

00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,640
have to give

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,560
everybody ownership in the thing that

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,519
you're talking about and this is

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,279
you know all good maintainers know this

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,640
there's a few bad maintainers that are

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,399
having to learn this now

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,680
because of the emphasis on diversity and

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,519
inclusion right now

00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,200
but it's really important and this is a

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,720
lesson i'm still learning i'm not

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,480
claiming to be good at this

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,079
but i'm saying that if i wasn't

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,519
interested in doing this i don't think

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,120
inner source comments would have gotten

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,760
very far

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,240
i have various lieutenants that that

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,240
we've

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,920
you know given more responsibility to

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,800
because they've shown both aptitude and

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,480
interest

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:21,040
and that's how you grow community

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,240
is you give away responsibility as much

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,399
as you can

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,880
and try to be you know a reasonably

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:30,240
benign

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:32,640
leader and treat everybody the same

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,320
treat everybody equally and kindly so

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,640
that's the first thing

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,839
the second thing is open source and

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,320
inner source are both

00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,040
enlightened self-interest endeavors if

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,399
it's not

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,480
making the people that are your

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,360
practitioners feel like they're getting

00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,600
somewhere

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,680
then they're not going to stick around

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,360
so you have to help them grow their

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,600
careers

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,720
for inner source commons we did a lot of

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,760
focus early on

00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:00,000
on training people how to um

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,240
speak effectively how to write a talk

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,560
quickly i wrote this talk very quickly

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,920
and how to speak effectively about about

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,000
the thing and now we

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,920
pick them out of the crowd and say we'd

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,279
like to hear you talk about this at the

00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,040
next summit

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,959
people who have never given a talk at

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,680
the scale that we're talking about

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,320
and then we coach them to help them get

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,120
through i

00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,519
we also for a long time we taught how to

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,279
write

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,880
a ignite talk which is a

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,240
five-minute format talk sort of like a

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,920
lightning talk but the slide

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,880
self-advance

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,160
so invest in people's careers i spend a

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,440
lot of time mentoring

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,519
people that reach out to me on

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,000
intersource commons to answer questions

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,279
about this

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,720
stuff and i refer them as much as i can

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,240
in the direction that they want to go if

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,680
they need to meet somebody to get there

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,680
i try to make that happen

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,600
so remember enlightened self-interest is

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,160
key and help them

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:54,000
and then last and we have rest distinct

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:57,279
thank for the phrasing of this

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,200
praise all contributions we try

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,200
very hard to be welcoming when people

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,920
show up at inner source commons

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,920
and we try very hard to recognize every

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,639
contribution

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,519
georg who is the vice president of the

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,240
of the board and i

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,480
as president do a talk at every summit

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,519
where we go over the major contributions

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,760
that people have made

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,920
in the last since the last summit we've

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,399
had some amazing contributions all of

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,399
our

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,399
training materials have been already

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,760
translated into multiple languages by

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:29,360
by volunteers um we just had a guy spend

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,600
his christmas vacation redoing our

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,320
website because he felt like it was time

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,920
you know so praises really effective at

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,120
getting people to stay

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:41,680
engaged and continue to move forward

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,959
um so i think the future's really bright

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,760
for inner source

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,959
i think that it is a form of piracy in a

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,920
way because it's

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,800
taking old ownership culture out of the

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,040
picture it's

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,199
it's calling it out for what it is which

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,720
is an old-fashioned way to do things

00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,839
it's like a monarchy

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,320
we need to go for a more um

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,120
generalized and and everybody's in the
