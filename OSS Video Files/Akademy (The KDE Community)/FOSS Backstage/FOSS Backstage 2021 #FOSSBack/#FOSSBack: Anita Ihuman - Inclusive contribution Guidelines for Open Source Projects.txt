Title: #FOSSBack: Anita Ihuman - Inclusive contribution Guidelines for Open Source Projects
Publication date: 2021-02-23
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	An important prerequisite for open source projects, software or community is proper documentation which includes a contributing guideline to encourage contributors to participate. Most times, beginners struggle with these contributing guidelines mainly because they are too technical to comprehend. This has become an obstacle for most beginners who are looking into contributing to Open Source.

This session will be  focused on;

- Problems With most contribution guidelines
- My experience as a beginner
- The need for inclusiveness in contribution guidelines
- Impact of detailed contribution guidelines to a project

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,040
human i'm a software developer technical

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,639
writer and a

00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,440
founder of open source and also cad

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,599
lover and these are my

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,800

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,039
always ready much

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,080
available and today i will be speaking

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:25,359
on the topic inclusive contribution

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,160
to inclusive contribution guidelines for

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:31,519
open source

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:34,559
projects and first and foremost

00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:38,399
what are contribution guidelines

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,879
and i define it as um a text file

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,680
that is created by project maintenance

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,800
that contains

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,160
guidelines on them on how people and new

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,320
contributors should

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,840
contribute to that particular project

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,879
the do's and don'ts on how they're

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,440
supposed to like

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,800
successfully carry on a pull request by

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,000
the end of the day

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,840
yes so but they're a couple of problems

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,800
that i noticed from my period

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:05,360
of um contributing to open source from

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,280
last year i was up to this point

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,080
but from a beginner perspective i

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,720
noticed a few mistakes that um

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,080
always happen in open source project on

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,880
them

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,840
and some of these common contribution

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:21,759
guidelines

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,280
problems are one it's always too

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,280
technical

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,320
so technically different in the sense

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,920
that

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,360
let's not forget that the contribution

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,479
guideline is supposed to give

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,680
us the detailed breakdown of our

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:40,960
particular project and how to set up

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,320
the project and this guidelines are set

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,759
out there for new contributors and the

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,479
people who are contributing to the

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:52,320
project for for the first time right

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,920
so if it happens to be too technical

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,759
in the sense that there's so many

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,560
technical terms and uh

00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,759
as in newbie i just heard about open

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,759
source and i come on

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,960
and i say okay let me try making a cool

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,759
request for the first time since i've

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,920
been given

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,119
i've heard a lot about open source and

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,440
then i see

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,760
the documentation contribution

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,000
guidelines are like too technical

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,840
i don't know the terms there how do i

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,640
understand what this project is about

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,400
and

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,280
there's this general idea that will come

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,879
to my mind as a new contributor this

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,400
project is not for you it is for

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,959
somebody that has close to

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,959
four to five years experience because

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,000
this kind of terms i don't think

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,480
a new being with very little

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,319
um expertise like me would be able to

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,000
contribute to this particular

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:44,000
project and um another problem

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:47,200
is um there's not enough details

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,680
yes documentations are like have like

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,280
so much writing you have to do this you

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,400
have to do that but it doesn't contain

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,640
like the major

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,160
details that actually put somebody

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,519
through does he have

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,440
the step to step guidelines okay

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,440
you have to make a pull request go to

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,760
this point click on this button

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,120
do these okay how to set up the

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,480
dependencies you have to do this

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,560
particular thing

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,400
okay this project needs this particular

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,400
framework to

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,599
run on your particular system does it

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,400
have this

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,760
guidelines that are already there or is

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,760
there an assumption that

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,120
a contribution should be aware that yeah

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,480
this project is this particular

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,280
framework under

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,760
she just hop on it it's one of the

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,480
problems i noticed and um

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,239
another problem is uh not usually

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,360
interactive

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:41,760
a lot of persons have difficulties

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:45,120
learning with just documentation

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,319
and if you're putting up a guideline

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,080
a step-by-step demo on how to set up a

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,439
particular project on my own

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:56,560
device at least it should have like

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:59,840
a demo or a short video or maybe

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,519
an audio recording that i could like

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,080
listen to or watch

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,200
and see how it is done that way it is me

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,200
the stress but

00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,879
i've not actually come across any

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,200
contribution guidelines that

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,840
are usually disinteractive and there are

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,079
very few open source projects that

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,440
actually make contribution guidelines

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,880
interactive

00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:24,240
and it's difficult to assess

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,520
it is a contribution guideline let

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,000
us not forget and it is supposed to be

00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,960
the main

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,520
thing that a new contributor sees once

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:43,840
it comes

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:43,840
onto that repository

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,919
six four pages looking for contribution

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,400
guidelines and

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,320
asking questions for from every team

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,720
member just to

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,840
just know where i can find the

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,800
contribution guidelines

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,479
do's and don'ts and a particular guy um

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,919
contribution guidelines and then

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:08,320
it is always hard to read

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,360
hard to read in the sense that like it

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,320
is so

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,919
conjected with information that you

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,240
always miss the

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,360
the very particular points that you are

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,800
supposed to

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,560
take note of like

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,160
there's so many informations i know that

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,039
these things are very important

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,759
but then the vital information is like

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,600
if you don't

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,759
install this particular framework then

00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,280
this project cannot run on your system

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,120
or if you don't have this particular

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,800
software on your system then this

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,360
project is not going to run from your

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,520
own end

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,800
these are things that should be stated

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,039
out there like because they're very

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,800
important i mean everybody should

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,039
know that yeah these are key points if i

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,400
don't do this then my project will not

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:53,680
work uh

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,639
yeah and um yes i'd like to share my

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,639
experience as

00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:01,199
a beginner so as i said i started um

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,240
contributing to open source sometime

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,280
august

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,080
and uh as a first time contributor i

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,280
think i was like

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,080
just four months into um web development

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,240
as a whole

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:17,039
so i i was eager to contribute because

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,319
i i always see people post on twitter ah

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,479
i just got i said

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,800
my pull request got accepted helped me

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,479
celebrate and people always so excited

00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,560
and i'm like okay i have to give this a

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,759
try i mean if people are really excited

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,440
about this and it's one thing and i

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,919
should give it a try also

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,280
and then i came up across an open source

00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:36,000
project

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,120
the issue the issue was a very minor

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
issue

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,520
like it's a so just a documentation but

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,720
i had to like

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,440
do a translation now for us

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,240
for a person who is like new to open

00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,199
source

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,880
and programming as a whole i didn't

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,960
understand like a lot of

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,080
technical terms and i was reading

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,199
through the readme because

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,639
i contacted somebody from the project

00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,639
and i'm like okay i want to go about

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,880
this symbol i can't actually

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,840
figure out my way around and this is my

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,759
first time

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,360
and they said i should check the readme

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,800
and the documentation everything is

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,800
there in the documentation

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,840
yes i've gone through the documentations

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,000
and i'm not seeing the important key

00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,960
points

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,520
what problem am i fixing and i'm trying

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,880
to

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,960
get this thing i don't know i don't i

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,680
didn't even know how to set up how to

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,560
 the repository or clone it i didn't

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,280
know how to do

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,160
none of that it took me approximately

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,319
two weeks

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,919
to fix that particular issue and

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,240
the sad thing is that i wasn't able to

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,720
fix it because i didn't get

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,520
like i was i got frustrated with the

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,280
whole

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,360
running about contacted different

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,280
persons and because i didn't know how

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,440
else to explain my situation

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,879
to somebody like okay this challenge i'm

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,360
i'm facing and

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,879
because of this particular thing i've

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,919
not been able to contribute my full

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,039
request is not going to

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,639
i didn't know how to explain it to

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,800
somebody like technical terms i know

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,160
even if i try to explain to somebody

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,319
they're like just check the

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,319
documentation it should be there every

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,000
open source project has documentation

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,280
that has everything written there but i

00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:14,560
couldn't just navigate around it

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,800
and that was a big problem for me i i

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,160
ended up not fixing the issues assigned

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,199
to somebody else

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,039
but a few weeks after

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,800
i was able to like go over other

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,440
projects and i saw

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,479
the whole process of how to how to

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,199
clone and then

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,360
make your changes sound and push back to

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,279
the repository and

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,640
i i realized that the issue i was

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,599
actually

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,279
breaking heads for was just something i

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,120
would have done in a few minutes but

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,160
because of a tiny

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,399
mistake i kept having issues and this

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,279
was another thing that gave me big-time

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,320
issues

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:54,480
i i was so frustrated but um

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,480
that is my short story and i'm coming

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,519
from a view of

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,760
a first-time contributor i think

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,000
you understand how it feels when you

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,080
come to a repository and

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,760
you're lost you don't know how to go

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,480
about the contribution guideline had not

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,880
clearly

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,240
stated out on telling what to do with

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,160
what not to do

00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,360
which step you should take the next and

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,120
um

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,120
that is just my story and

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,800
yes um why should we improve

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,959
contribution guidelines

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,000
and because um the first time

00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,120
contributors

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,640
can be a code maintainer tomorrow now

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,200
open source is based on um contributors

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,640
yeah

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,240
and so the contributor should be like

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,240
the key factor and if

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,360
i come into a project as a contributor

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,800
and um i'm not

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,880
able to find my way around

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,399
i would definitely abandon that project

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,279
i would want to go there again because

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,560
i'm like ah

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:51,120
that project i would have loved to

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,880
contribute to it but assistants

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,160
i don't really understand the kind of

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,160
terms they're using

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,160
i don't understand how the processes are

00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,519
done this i actually get confused in

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,720
this particular project so i think i

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,160
would just keep

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,000
well that's the way i would put it

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,000
because i wouldn't want to go through

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,480
the stress i went on the first day

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,240
for any project again and i wouldn't

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,120
want anybody to experience that i'm sure

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,680
that's how

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,279
a new beginner would feel if he doesn't

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,240
get um

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,360
the right contribution guidelines and

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,200
another way is to

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:26,640
make a welcoming environment

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,959
make it if we have

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,760
stated our construction guidelines it

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,959
makes the

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,040
the contributors to feel like yeah this

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,519
this project feels like it's actually

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,200
convenient for me to be here if i

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,800
they feel like they actually understand

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,399
that i am new i feel like

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,800
that's not that i am with this project

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,000
and i need proper guidelines i mean if

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,120
somebody can actually take

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,399
out their time and document how to

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:56,000
go about contributing as

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:58,000
step to step as this then i mean

00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,519
they care about the contributors and i

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,880
always i always want to stick around a

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,040
particular project

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,240
and then yes another reason is for sake

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,360
of references

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,920
if i wanted about me as a contributor if

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,079
i

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,240
see an issue in a particular project and

00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,079
then fixing it was not so difficult i

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,760
always refer somebody and i'm like

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,160
yes if you want to contribute to open

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,240
source this project is the best it

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,519
is the right place for you because

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,360
they're welcoming

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,880
and everything is very friendly for

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,240
beginners so if you're a beginner you're

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,800
looking for open source project

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,160
then you should start here and um i

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,680
don't think it's only for me

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,279
i i mean there are lots of persons that

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,200
will actually do that reference and

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,440
super six of references

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,680
and the contribution guidelines should

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,480
be properly

00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:45,200
documented and um

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,399
how can we achieve an inclusive

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,959
contribution

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,959
guideline

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:59,680
yeah the first step i put out

00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:03,200
to help in achieving a proper

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:08,240
construction guidelines is to translate

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,240
documentation into various languages

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,320
some time ago i was contributing to a

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,959
particular open source project i was

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,560
doing

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:18,480
a hacktoberfest and i had this issue and

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,920
it says translated german

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,200
and for a moment i stopped to ask myself

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,200
why are they translating their

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,920
contribution guidelines

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,639
to german i mean they should know that

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,600
everybody

00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,360
across the world is going to have access

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,200
to this particular

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,720
repository and we want to go over the

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,880
contribution guidelines but then what's

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,480
their main reason so i asked them

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,560
the person which are the maintainer of

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,040
that particular project and the reasons

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,320
i got

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,160
made sense to an expert they said most

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,800
of their contributors are like

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,160
german so they have to make a confident

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,480
environment for them to

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,320
contribute like so it won't be so

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,680
difficult you have to translate to

00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,519
german before you actually understand

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,000
what they're contributing to

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,639
but they seem to forget that i'm not

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,240
german

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,480
and i'm sure other people too they're

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,680
not german

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,680
there's so many people that are not

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,200
actually german right now and we're

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,880
coming to this particular project it's

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,440
hard to buffer us everyone is eager to

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,600
fix an

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,800
issue but what are people who are not

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,920
actually german

00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,279
and if um the documentation is

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,320
translated into

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,959
various languages or there is a way to

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,959
get

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,399
translations into any language of a

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:30,399
choice depending on where the

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,040
contributor is actually based or coming

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,639
from

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,600
then it will make a lot of times

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:40,639
another one isn't make tutorials on

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,639
project setup

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:47,680
sorry yeah

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:50,320
every open source project if you ask me

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,440
you should consider including

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:56,399
screencasts and um recordings and um

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,440
short videos on how to actually

00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,959
contribute to

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:03,040
a particular project set up like in

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,800
particular organization there should be

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,120
somebody

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,959
one of the code maintainers who are like

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,480
very grounded in that particular thing

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:14,079
what will be willing to do

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,800
a step-by-step guide on how to get along

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,920
on that particular project on the setup

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,440
and how to

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,839
finally arrive with a good crew request

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,240
i could

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,639
mesh immediately and this would really

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,199
be helpful to a contributor because

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,079
a lot of persons who actually relate

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,600
better

00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:35,519
with um videos and the demos than just

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,839
reading through documentation and

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:40,480
because definitely you miss a point and

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,040
at that point when you miss a point how

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,440
do you

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,480
how do you reframe yourself how do you

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,000
go back

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,839
to the point that you actually made a

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,360
mistake if you're not like

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:54,639
very aware of what you're doing

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:57,440
another way that i would to

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,959
improve contribution guidelines avoid

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,000
too many technical terms

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:04,079
let us get in mind that we are looking

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,440
for new contributors or even

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,399
contributors to that particular

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,480
repository

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,839
that are not very grounded on that

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,160
particular thing and

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,079
if the documentation and the

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,519
contribution guidelines are

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:19,199
so technical for someone with basic

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,880
knowledge about open source or

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,360
open source projects at all to

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,360
understand it's very difficult for

00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,480
contributors to actually meet make

00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,160
attempts

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,399
on how to like contribute to that

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:33,040
particular project

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,880
so the technical terms we made very

00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,360
friendly and um

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,160
broken down into like very very basic

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,880
terms that

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,560
anybody even somebody who has like the

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,079
least knowledge about open source could

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,959
read about a particular

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,320
contribution guideline and set up a

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,600
particular project

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:55,600
without having to google each term

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,600
after each line you read

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,360
this will really save a lot of um

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,399
headaches for

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,480
new contributors and um

00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,920
another point i wrote artisan to make

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,920
contribution guidelines

00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:12,880
obvious it is a contribution guidelines

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,759
can can it just be like the first thing

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,959
i see

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:19,040
when i come into a project because

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,000
i wouldn't want to start looking for

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,560
where to

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,639
to see a contribution guy like the way i

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,199
did in my own time going from page to

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,480
page

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:29,839
asking questions on from one member to

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,120
the other how can you do this can you

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,079
schedule meeting less

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,120
so that you can show me how to go about

00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,320
the contribution

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,800
i mean it should be very obvious and

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,759
read me that yes contribution guidelines

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,800
i hear for

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:48,160
somebody who is new to this particular

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:51,120
project and

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,120
another is um we should build a bridge

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,399
and by building a bridge i mean we

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,600
should um

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:59,199
we should set up a code of conduct for

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,240
members of the community

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:05,439
this is because yes

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,679
everyone has like self-control

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:10,240
but not all the time the times when you

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,400
get very furious either by

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,280
a particular events that trigger the

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,679
anger or

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,039
another one and then you when you plan a

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,959
review or anything

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,880
as a member of community might it might

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,919
just be harsh to the next person

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,720
without even knowing it and this always

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,799
goes on

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:29,520
i mean we're humans and it's very easy

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:32,240
for us to flare up at any point in time

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,760
but if we build a bridge and um setting

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,720
up code of conduct

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,000
then people will always have them to

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,640
instill a sense of

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,360
proper behavioral attitude for each

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,840
member

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,640
such that they have the same they

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,280
actually

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,400
reply to the underrepresented members of

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,200
the community

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,559
as um in the most friendly way when it

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,080
comes to

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:58,400
and using some powers

00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,520
or hash words towards people when they

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:04,160
ask questions

00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:07,679
would they will be avoided

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,799
and um another is to ensure that the

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,679
guidelines

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:14,000
contain complete information is there

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,080
any detail that is left hanging from

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,400
that particular contribution guideline

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,600
i mean you should have from the first

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,000
step of um

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,160
coming into the repository down to the

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,880
point where the pull request is meshed

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,880
and then

00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,400
you're sent the congratulations your

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,000
pure request has been meshed

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,760
this step-by-step guide should be

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,720
documented in the contribution

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,320
guidelines so that

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,080
even if i i have very little basic

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,640
knowledge about contributing to open

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,200
source

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,559
i will be able to um follow the

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,840
guidelines

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,559
and then complete the whole contribution

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,840
process

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:53,440
without having any issues

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,679
and um if

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,039
if in case where like there are other

00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,160
issues like

00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:01,679
which particular code what i contribute

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,480
is the code ways or

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,360
is it um documentation or is it certain

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,840
design

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,880
then all this the information should be

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,080
stated

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,640
in the contribution guidelines

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,520
and it should specify how you can reach

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,520
for help

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:21,600
and in a case where you you reach

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,840
the hard end i don't know what else to

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,360
do you don't know which net which step

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,600
to go next

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,400
then the contribution guidelines should

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,080
um

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:35,360
specify that yes in case

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,120
of conclusion or if you get lost

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,640
then you can reach out to this person or

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,760
contact this person

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,240
for assistance you get

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,200
this would help contributors know that

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,200
yes um

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,000
even if i'm like unaware of what i'm

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,919
doing

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,600
because the community is willing to help

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,200
me and um

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,039
it would be a big deal for me to

00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,000
actually want to reach out to somebody

00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,559
that has

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,200
more knowledge on that particular open

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,720
source

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,840
project and uh also

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,120
it should be welcoming to everyone this

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,320
is because

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,600
a lot of projects when

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,919
when it comes to open source

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,760
contribution they

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,120
they always keep the parts where they

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,320
have to include

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,360
that designers and the right technical

00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,960
writers

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:29,200
are welcome what if i'm not

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,559
like code incline what if i have very

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:34,000
little ideas

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:36,640
about anything called these

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,640
and i want to just design on that

00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,320
particular open source project or i was

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,159
just writing documentation

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,440
the contribution guidelines should

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,760
include each

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,760
and every single member that could

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:51,120
possibly want to contribute

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:54,080
regardless of a particular

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,720
listen skill so it should be welcoming

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:58,320
to every

00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,960
skill set whatsoever it may be it

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,440
stating that yes designers if you have

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,440
to

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,039
contribute design issues this is where

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,559
you look for them there could be

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,480
repositories that are set up for

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,400
designers only for

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,840
designers and there may be a

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,760
documentation issues

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,640
also okay if you're a technical writer

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,600
and you want to help in the

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,200
documentation

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,159
this particular this is the site where

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,679
you find

00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,280
all the documentation all the

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:23,840
documentation that you could contribute

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,880
to

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,400
and um this is a way of making making

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,880
contribution guidelines

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,640
more inclusive and um welcoming to

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,400
everybody

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,360
yes and um that being said thank you so

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,360
much

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,559
for your time and thank you so much for

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,520
listening

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,720
and um i really hope that every

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,799
open-source project

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,960
begins to see things from the beginners

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,480
the beginner's view also and not only

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,960
from the expat

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,679
aspect i mean everyone should reason

00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,440
that yes

00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,440
what if this is my first time

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,360
contributing and this contribution

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,480
guidelines i think that detailed enough

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,280
for me to

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,000
get started with this particular project

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,720
should always

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,720
have every contributor in mind because

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,559
they are like the backbone of every open

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,000
source project

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,679
thank you so much for your time and

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,480
thank you so much for listening i'll

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,159
take any questions if there are any

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,799
anita thank you so much for the talk

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,720

uh at the end of your talk there and i

00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,000
think i could speak for everybody when

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,919
so i work

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,039
uh have worked on open source projects

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,000
and i think your

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:36,240
your list your manifesto in a way of

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,080
what makes a good

00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,080

from the experience that you've had as a

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,000
beginner

00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,320
have you come across any open source

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,919
projects that you have found to be

00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,679
particularly

00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,120
good or matching with some of the things

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:05,200
that you wish they had like

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,559
some standout project recently this year

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,080
that every open source

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,760
project that i have decided to

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,520
contribute to

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,360

jesus finally somebody is doing

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,640
something that everybody should actually

00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,840
look up to

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,400
because imagine actually coming going

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,880
through

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,000
the hell i went through two weeks of

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,600
fixing just one

00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:32,159
issue and i couldn't do it

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,600
can you can you name some of them just

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,960
for people to look at maybe if they want

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,000
to see

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,039
yes and the layer 5 issue the layer 5

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,400
repositories

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:44,000
are like so detailed like the community

00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,400
is welcoming aside that

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,720
but then they clearly state out the

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,279
documentation so that everybody can get

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,799
along

00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:53,200
and if you have an issue they always

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:55,039
refer you to like the maintenance and

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,559
people that will always walk you through

00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,320
if you're having issues and you're like

00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:01,520
a contributor for the first time

00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,240

new time contributors and

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,480
genome projects are also setting out the

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,240
documentation

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,520

questions out there i have one more if

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,559
uh while we wait for any others to come

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,559
in i'm curious about

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,720
these you mentioned interactivity so

00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,159
being able to like watch a video which

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,600
you know i'm a very visual learner so i

00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,760
appreciate that as well

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,600
i'm wondering if interactive help are

00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:29,520
there channels that you have found to be

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,240
particularly useful whether it's getter

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,720
or irc or slack or whatever

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,000
um like means to interact with people in

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,159
that way have you found some to be

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,600
better than others

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,960
yes um slack is friendly like slack is

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,799
it's a way to interact with your

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,840
contributors but

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,320
um interactiveness what i actually meant

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,159
in that

00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:54,240
aspect was um creating demos and um

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,640
videos that are like maybe youtube

00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,799
videos it could be like two minutes or

00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,159
three minutes it doesn't matter the

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,559
length so long as it gives

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,679
every step by step details that you

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,440
could actually use

00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,760
like get started in that particular

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,679
project i'm sure every contributor would

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,159
really appreciate the time taken out to

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,640
make

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,200
that project and it's really helped

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,600
people

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,720
to go a long way because their videos

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,039
and everyone can

00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,000
actually refer to them at any point in

00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,320
time

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
if they're having challenges so does um

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,679
interactiveness i was talking

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,880
about that sounds great i know

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,080
one thing that was mentioned and

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,080
something that i've definitely felt as

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,640
well as your idea of

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,320
not too much technical jargon or at

00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,520
least being able to explain it so people

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,919
understand if you're working in a

00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,960
project what does a particular term

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,600
mean for a project i i have had to

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,120
google

00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:49,440
several times i've had to google like a

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,720
a sentence where to work just to make

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,159
sure i understand that

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,480
yeah this is what this this time you're

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:57,120
talking about and

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,600
it gets funny sometimes but it helps

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,600
with the vocabulary but then

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,200
it gets stressful sometimes you don't

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,960
have to do everything

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,360
it's made easy i think this is a great

00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,840
list

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,600
so anita thank you so much for your talk

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,200
appreciate it i think the audience uh

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,799
took a lot out of it and definitely have

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,799
some some work to do on their own

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:21,840
contribution guidelines

00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:21,840
so thank you for that

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,679
