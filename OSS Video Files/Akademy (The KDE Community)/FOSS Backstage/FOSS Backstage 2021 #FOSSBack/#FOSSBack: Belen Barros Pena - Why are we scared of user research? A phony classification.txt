Title: #FOSSBack: Belen Barros Pena - Why are we scared of user research? A phony classification
Publication date: 2021-03-01
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Most of the free software projects I know do little to none research with their users. Well ... the vast majority do absolutely none, and very few do a teensy little bit, most of the time with the most vocal members of their user base. Why is that? Why is free software scared of user research?


This presentation will propose a classification of free software types based on their ideas and attitudes towards user research. The classification is really just a joke, but I hope it will help me debunk some of the misunderstandings and myths that surround user research in free software circles. I will also try to explain what user research is actually about, how it can help your free software project, and give you some advice on how to get started with it.

thank you paul

00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,720
um and thank you everybody for joining

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,360
me in this session

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,000
where i'm gonna try and talk about um

00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,960
why

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,800
we are not doing user research in free

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,680
software

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,080
the truth is that the vast majority of

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,359
the free software projects i know of

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:30,560
don't do any research with users at all

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:33,440
and those that they they tend to do

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,360
surveys which is kind of the lowest

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,040
common denominator

00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,360
in the world of user research and to be

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,760
honest they on their own

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,040
they are not even that useful for these

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,239
online purposes

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,480
so why is this why aren't we doing

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,600
user research in free software why are

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,760
we scared

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,800
of it um if i guess if i'm going to talk

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,640
about design

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,480
and research and the relationship

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,640
between the two i probably should

00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,840
start by explaining what i mean by

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,199
design

00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:08,240
and what i mean by research so

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:11,040
for the purposes of this stock design

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,680
is interaction design and interaction

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,920
design

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,119
is the branch of design that deals with

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,240
the structure

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,560
and the behavior of software interfaces

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,920
and interaction design is what you what

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,960
you're doing with you are making

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,000
decisions about

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,200
what your software should do and how it

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,439
should do it

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,200
and understood in this fashion

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,880
interaction design applies

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,479
to all kinds of software and all kinds

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,159
of interfaces

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,880
not just the graphical ones

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,680
and for the purpose of this talk

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,799
research

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,920
is any activity that involves

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,720
your users in the process of making

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,520
the software so basically user research

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,960
is about

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,840
getting users to help you or to work

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,000
with you

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,000
in the interaction design work

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,840
can interaction design exist without

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,000
research

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,239
can it truly be done without the

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,040
research parts

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,040
in the university where i study i am

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,680
surrounded by people who believe

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,840
that you cannot do interaction design

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,480
and you shouldn't be designing anything

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,599
really

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,680
without doing research but

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,680
when i spend time with people in the

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,959
free software world

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,599
very often or often i come across people

00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,840
who are

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:38,480
somehow weary

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:41,599
nervous and sometimes downright

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,920
hostile to this idea of doing research

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:47,200
with users as part of the process

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,239
of making and developing software

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,440
those people have come to call somehow

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,959
drunkenly

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,239
the naysayers and um on the basis of

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,080
their arguments

00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,280
against his research i've come to

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,519
classify them

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:07,280
into four groups they do scratchers

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:10,480
this scornful the dismissive

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,720
and the defeatist so if you allow me i'm

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,760
going to go through each every turn

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,080
so let's start with the each scratchers

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,800
the age of scratchers are people who

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,800
believe

00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,920
who are developing software who are

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,640
making software

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,280
and but to solve a problem that they

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,480
believe is

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,360
solely their own since this is

00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,360
my problem they said that the only

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,799
people i need to do research with

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,680
is myself other people are welcome

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,519
to use my software if they want to do so

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,680
but in the understanding

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:49,440
that my software is about my problem

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,680
and it might not be ideal for them

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,280
although there is a certain logic to

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,480
this argument

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,159
i think it is also somehow detached from

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,400
reality

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,280
you see um when you make a piece of

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,720
software

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,840
your age it's your age

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:11,519
as long as you are the only person using

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,000
that software the moment a user comes

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,439
along

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,920
someone else comes along and starts

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,799
using your software the age all of a

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,639
sudden

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:23,759
becomes 15 yours and 50

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:27,360
someone else's when a second user

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,639
comes along then the age becomes about

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,199
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:36,880
yours when a third user appears

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:40,160
your itch becomes 20 yours

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:43,479
do you see where i'm going with this

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,880
the percentage of your age reduces

00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:48,080
exponentially

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:51,919
as you add answers to your software

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:55,040
so by the time 50 people are using it

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:59,040
your age what used to be your inch

00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,120
is now only to present yours

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,960
of course you may used to tell you may

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,680
choose to tell yourself that your age is

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,039
still your age but that doesn't that

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,080
doesn't change the fact

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:13,120
that it is not anymore the

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,520
only way for your each to remain

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,800
your age is keeping the source code to

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,840
yourself

00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,120
the moment you release your code then

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,600
for the world to use

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,639
you need to clone to terms with the fact

00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,080
that your each

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,400
is unlikely to remain yours for loan

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,680
the truth is that the moment you release

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,440
your code

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,440
you release your each with it

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,880
the second type of naysayers are the

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,440
squirmful

00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,919
and the squirmful are the kind of people

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,120
who will quote you henry ford

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,000
they argue that people that users of

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,400
software

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,560
are incapable of telling you what they

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,039
need or what they want

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,880
and that use it that designers are

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,199
somehow better positioned

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,240
to determine those things than people

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,360
themselves

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,479
as its designers or some kind of

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,600
you know superior or more evolved kind

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,240
of human being

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,319
one that has managed to overcome their

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,199
limitation the human limitation that

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:20,319
stops us from being able to articulate

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,080
our own needs and wants

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,080
i'm sure i don't need to convince you

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,800
that people who believe designers are in

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,000
any way superior to other human beings

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,720
are killing themselves designers are

00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
are in as incapable of articulating

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,400
their own wants and

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,800
needs and determining what it is that

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,240
they want or what they need as anyone

00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,120
else

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,319
the only superpower designers have is

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,960
the recognition

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,080
that this is so that this is a

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,639
quintessential

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,880
human limitation and that overcoming

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,840
that limitation requires time

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,280
and effort and that certain tricks of

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,919
the design trait

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,120
for instance doing research with users

00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,050
can help us

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,080
overcome that limitation

00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:09,360
[Music]

00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,800
the third type of naysayer is the

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,080
dismissive

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,000
the dismissive um that this mystic will

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,800
tell you that every time you ask

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,400
someone anything related to the sign

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,440
every single person

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,599
will tell you a different thing

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,199
and then the designer will be left to

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,520
try and sort out the mess

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,880
the designer will need to try and

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,759
reconcile

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:35,360
different opinions about things that may

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,520
not only just be different

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,800
sometimes they need they may be also

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,880
contradictory

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,240
so they they could very well be

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,000
reconcilable

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,840
and these will lead to the sign

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,479
paralysis where god

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:51,039
saves us all the dreaded desire by

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,039
committing

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,280
these people seem to be under this brush

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,440
under the impression that

00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,680
doing research with users is about

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:03,039
asking the users their opinion

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,759
about things what they think about stuff

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,400
but actually doing research with users

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,440
is

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,319
not like that at all

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,879
the object of the study in user research

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,240
is not

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:19,599
user's opinions it's actually

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,160
human behavior

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,160
and in the process of trying to make

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,720
sense of understanding human behavior

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,400
sometimes when we do research we'll have

00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,520
conversations with people and we'll ask

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,360
them questions

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,519
but those questions will never be

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,880
directly about the software we are

00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,880
building

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,320
or the thing we are designing they will

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,479
be about the problem

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,560
we are trying to solve with the software

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,120
about the context and the circumstances

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,680
in which

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,880
that problem exists and about the ways

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,760
people try to solve

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:52,399
that problem now before using the

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:55,920
software which are often very quirky and

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:58,080
very creative and sometimes the research

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,080
we do a whole chunk of the research with

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,800
users actually does not involve

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,320
any question asking at all it involves

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,080
just observing

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,000
observing how people go about their

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,560
business observing how

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,279
they solve their problems observing the

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,920
context

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,839
within which they live and do things and

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,839
sometimes yes

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,600
it also involves watching people

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,760
observing people as they use

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:25,040
our software what we often call

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,040
usability testing

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,760
as we go about observing people's

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,399
behaviors we come across the fact

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,399
that these are very individual you know

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,800
every person is slightly different

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,440
but across that individuality there are

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,480
also

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:43,120
strong patterns and commonalities and

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,680
sameness those are the things that are

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,160
normally

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,399
really extremely useful to designers

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,920
those are the things we are hunting for

00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:54,880
when we are doing user research

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,040
and because in the end design research

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,760
user research has absolutely nothing to

00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,920
do

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,040
and with opinions as i said of what

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,320
people think

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:08,640
it is about uncovering the commonalities

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:11,760
underpin individual human behavior

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:15,519
and finally the last type of naysayer

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:18,079
in free supper i called daddy fittest

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,360
the deputies claimed that research doing

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,320
research with users

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,360
it's just too much work it takes too

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,560
much time

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,040
too much energy too much effort too much

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,399
money

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:33,680
and because of that it is unsuitable

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:36,800
for free software projects

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,839
i imagine that for the defeatist and the

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,600
word research

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,920
must conjure images of you know fancy

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,360
research labs with one-way mirrors and

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,640
loads of cameras

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:52,079
or really long longitudinal studies

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:55,120
or years long ethnographic endeavors and

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:57,920
that result in ten thousand

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,440
paper ten thousand word papers and that

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,320
are gonna be published in a very serious

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,040
journal

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,320
and that's the stuff academics do

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:08,399
because they are trying

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,959
to develop theory but hang on a minute

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,040
we are not trying to develop theory here

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,959
we are just trying to make some software

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,880
for crying out loud so here is the truth

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,880
about the kind of research that is

00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,560
suitable for our software

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,959
making purposes let's start with tom

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,160
how long does it take to do this type of

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,959
research

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,640
well if you will if you want to do an

00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,959
interview study if you're going to go

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,000
and

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:38,399
talk to some of your users six users

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,480
is enough and if you want to do a

00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,560
usability test study you want to observe

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,000
people as they use your software

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:48,399
five people five users is enough

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,200
your visual sessions should never be

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:54,079
longer than 45 minutes

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,480
this means that a usability study can be

00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,480
done in three hours and 45 minutes

00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,760
and an interview study can be done in

00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,160
four and a half

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,079
hours i don't know about you but i don't

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,320
think i don't think this is that much

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,639
time

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,600
what about the money how much does it

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,680
cost

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,720
to do research is it really that

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,079
expensive

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,200
well let's see tons of research with

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:21,120
users can be done

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:24,000
remotely using things like gt meat

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,200
and research can be captured by

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,240
recording audio

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:31,120
and video and with things like obs

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,120
studio completely for free as before

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:36,000
with youtube

00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:39,360
and you don't need to pay money to your

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,600
research participants necessarily

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,200
and you see there are lots of ways that

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,360
you can compensate

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,360
your research participants for their

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,560
time their effort other feedback

00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,360
you just need to have an honest

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,279
conversation with with them about it

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,560
perhaps they want some training about

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,800
something to do with the software in

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,560
return for taking part of your research

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,639
or maybe there's just one they just want

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,040
a t-shirt or some stickers

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,200
or maybe they just want to thank you

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,480
just a thank you maybe enough

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,279
you see um taking part in research is a

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,920
form

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,360
of contributing to free software just

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,560
like submitting code or writing

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,959
documentation

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,880
a lot of us contribute to his software

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:21,600
to free support for pleasure

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,720
so it is very likely that some of your

00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,800
user base at least

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,079
will be willing to help you just for the

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,160
pleasure to help

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,240
a free software project remember

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,959
research is a form of contribution to

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,360
this software

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,079
even if we are not used to think of it

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,160
that way

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,519
and we should really start considering

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,720
and valuing it

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:43,040
so so

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,639
research it turns out that research

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:48,560
doesn't need to be expensive

00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:51,760
and can be known for zero euro

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,600
what about the effort the bulk of the

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,160
effort of doing research

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,000
is actually making sense of it what we

00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,839
call the analysis process

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,720
trying to understand what it is that the

00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,720
research is trying to tell you

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,320
research analysis can be done quite

00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,720
effectively in teams

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,320
using the affinity diagram technique

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,760
which this is what the video is showing

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,199
you at the moment a group of people

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,160
trying to make sense of research

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,279
altogether

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:20,720
so this can be done in a few hours but

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,279
because your research studies are likely

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,040
to be

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:25,360
small with a small number of

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,839
participants and short sessions

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,360
and you can easily analyze the research

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,600
by yourself as well

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,519
in just a couple of hours here's an

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,040
example of that kind of analysis that i

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,240
did just by myself

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,399
in about an hour and a half and you

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,079
don't need to write after working out

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,079
what the research was trying to tell you

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:45,920
in order to communicate

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,199
your research to other people involved

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,360
in the free software project you don't

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:52,000
need to write a 100 page report

00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,920
in fact you shouldn't write a 100 page

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,040
report because it's guaranteed that

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,000
nobody will read it

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,720
and you can just simply write a blog

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,079
post

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,240
or a wiki page or an email

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,240
to a mailing list or you can organize a

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,199
call or record a

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,160
podcast to explain what you learned

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,000
through the research

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,240
all these shortcuts will do and they

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,279
come with all very effectively in

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,040
a very short period of time

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,760
so really it doesn't take that much

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,880
effort doing research either

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,480
so finally some common sense advice

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,680
if you want to introduce research

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:33,680
activities in your free software project

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:36,160
first and if it looks like you cannot

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,959
answer the questions you have about your

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,680
software

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,320
and with one of these small studies

00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,560
break

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,440
down your research questions into

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,639
simpler

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,320
research questions okay just make the

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,920
questions you're asking yourself and the

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,920
software and the questions you want to

00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,120
ask your users a little bit simpler

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,920
and organize several smaller studies

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,759
instead of a really big one in the end

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,560
you are way more likely to learn

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,480
more stuff with these many studies that

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,120
if you organize a single study that is

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,560
really big

00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,160
that's really not a very effective way

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,800
of working so no

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,800
no don't talk to 30 users for in a

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,680
single study that doesn't make sense

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:19,199
just organize six different studies five

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,199
different studies with six people

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,440
get into the habit of doing research

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,720
periodically for instance

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,480
a user interview per month and this way

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,639
your insights about your users your

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,279
knowledge of the users will build over

00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,000
time

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,639
as you do more and more of those in the

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,480
end

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,959
free software projects are not in a

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,120
hurry you don't need to beat anyone to

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:43,279
market or any crap like that

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,600
so you can take your time with the

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:48,079
research too

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,399
and finally remember that research is

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:52,800
not a bunch of activities to do

00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,839
research is first and foremost a

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,600
narcissist

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,040
an attitude that you bring with you to

00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,000
every single encounter

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,720
with your users an attitude of genuine

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,160
interest

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,880
that results in detailed observations of

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,919
human

00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,520
behavior immerse yourself in the

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,559
environment of your users

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:15,280
observe the ways they go about stuff

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,799
and watch them as they use your software

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,839
um

00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,120
because um don't let you know don't let

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,199
the naysayers

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,360
stop you from doing software for doing

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,400
research for your free software project

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,480
because sure we can make just

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,960
software without doing any research with

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,520
your users but if you want to make

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,080
good software the kind of software that

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,799
makes

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,000
sense to the people who use it you

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,240
cannot do that

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,600
without messing about with the research

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,840
bits

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,840
thanks very much

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,640
