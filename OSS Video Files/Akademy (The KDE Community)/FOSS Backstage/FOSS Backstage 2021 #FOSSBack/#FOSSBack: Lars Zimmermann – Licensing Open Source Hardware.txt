Title: #FOSSBack: Lars Zimmermann – Licensing Open Source Hardware
Publication date: 2021-02-25
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Link to the public slides of this talk: https://opencircularity.info/osh-licenses/

While the situation around licensing in software is always worth a debate and not quite as settled as it could be the situation for hardware is much worse. There are a lot of misconceptions out there about how to license hardware designs. This talk will show you some of the common misunderstandings, highlight the open questions, propose some collective action to fix the situation and yes - of course - also explain how things are done the right way. 

The talk will be a summary and extended version of the public FAQ "Why are Creative Commons Non Commercial licenses not Open Source and a big problem in hardware and product design".

okay

00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,360
uh i don't have a slideshow my slides

00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,000
are a public website so

00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,840
uh i encourage all of you to go to this

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,679
website here and uh

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,199
read while i'm talking and click maybe

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,279
jump ahead if you're bored

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,640
i said i'm a designer artist and

00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:21,760
activist and i have a couple of

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,199
disclaimers

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,599
this is a talk about legal issues but

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,320
i'm

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:30,160
not a lawyer so this is no legal advice

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,559
but i gave my best to really figure

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,160
out how this is right then uh disclaimer

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:35,120
two different countries have different

00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,680
laws

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,559
uh but what i am going to explain here

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,040
should match

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,640
the legal situation here in germany and

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,760
europe and probably

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,520
a lot of parts of the world too then

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,920
disclaimer three this is just a fraction

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,320
of

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,360
the complex problem of licensing open

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,840
hardware

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,920
of course i need i had to pick uh

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,640
something to focus on here

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,840
okay let's start um and i start with

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,600
statement and that is

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,400
licensing open source hardware is really

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,119
messy and it's broken at least compared

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,439
uh to software from my point of views

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,360
the world of software looks just amazing

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,320
early organized and the reason for this

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,520
is that

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,880
software is governed by copyright law

00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,880
as probably all you know

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,159
like works of art and images and this

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,960
makes everything somehow very simple

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,560
because

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,320
copyright is something you receive

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,119
automatically the moment you create

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,600
something

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,880
and this means that software is born

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,200
closed

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,400
uh but this makes the situation very

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,880
clear from the beginning

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,759
you know if you see a piece of software

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,680
it's closed

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,360
you have to find someone who owns it and

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,840
this someone needs to become

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,680
active to open it and there's a simple

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,439
standard way just pick one of the many

00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,520
existing ready-to-use open source

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,240
licenses or maybe a creative commons

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,000
license

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,280
because all of these licenses are

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,880
copyright based

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,040
and then they make a statement or what

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,600
you allow others to do with your work

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,040
under the conditions uh you want them to

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,719
fulfill

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,560
but here is uh where we entered the

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,759
realm of hardware we entered a realm of

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,840
functionalities

00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,800
and where functionalities start

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,360
copyright

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,319
automatically ends so copyright

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,640
explicitly

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,120
does not apply to anything that has to

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,800
do with functionalities

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,879
and this of course also means that

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,080
copyright based licenses

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,840
don't apply to hardware and the simple

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,680
story here is imagine you write a book

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,080
about a time machine then the book

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,599
the novel is protected by copyright law

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,080
but the machine you describe

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,080
in the book is not everyone can build it

00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,440
unless you have a patent or design

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,400
rights registered of course

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,360
we still need copyright based licenses

00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,040
for the uh in

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,480
an open source hardware but only for the

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,200
documentation so

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,680
so the source uh for example the

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,120
description or images how to's and so on

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,519
but it really needs to be clear that

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,360
these

00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,000
licenses usually creative commons

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,879
licenses i don't say anything about the

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,319
hardware itself

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,319
just about the design files

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,720
so the thing with patents

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,319
is that they are really fundamentally

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,840
different from copyright

00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:18,319
the key difference is that all hardware

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,040
is born free you don't receive a patent

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,000
automatically you have to become active

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,959
to get it

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,440
and to close the hardware and this comes

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,080
first with costs while copyright was for

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,879
free

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,360
and you can only patent ideas that are

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,799
new

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,159
so you can't paint in anything that is

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,519
already known to the public this is

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,239
already prior art

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,519
while you can remix classic ideas uh in

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,239
software or

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,280
in novels and so on so this is really

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,959
important to understand

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,959
hardware is born free

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,560
so the question is then how to tackle

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,680
the legal side of it

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,799
and the answer is very easy just do

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,080
nothing except publish your work very

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,080
prominently

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,280
for example on the web with this it

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,360
becomes prior art

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,519
it goes into the comments and no one

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,720
including yourself can close it

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,720
anymore forever um

00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,959
but this of course also means that you

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,159
then can't tell others what they can do

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,280
with your

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:17,759
work you have no way to govern what they

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,600
do

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,680
how they use it and what they give back

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,960
for example

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,880
theoretically yes you could

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,800
if you have an invention that is new you

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,160
could file a patent then you get

00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,919
exclusive rights

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,240
and then you could create a public

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,919
license that allows everyone to use your

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,400
invention under the conditions of your

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:38,720
choice

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,520
but does it make sense to invest a lot

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,320
of money

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,680
to then open it up again no it doesn't

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,240
so again it's easy

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,520
publish it and do nothing else and then

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,600
embrace the fact

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,520
that no one including yourself can

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,960
dictate to anyone if and how the

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,040
hardware is used

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,960
but the truth is this doesn't seem easy

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,639
for people to accept and therefore to

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,560
understand i will get to this in a

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,160
moment i would just mention that um here

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,520
in europe and germany and i think in the

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,680
u.s too

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,919
we have more forms of property rights

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,759
that apply to hardware for example

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,600
design rights that protect a little bit

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,560
how something looks

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,199
or utility rights um or models that

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,360
protect

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,360
how something works it's basically just

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,560
the smaller version the cheaper version

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,560
but also weaker of a patent um

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,320
both of these uh property rights are

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,000
closer to the patent because you also

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,080
don't receive them automatically you

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,720
have to become active to file them

00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,280
and uh it only works if what you want to

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,960
uh

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:40,639
protect is new so if the fact remains

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,960
star hardware is still born free

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,479
um if you want to learn more about this

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,960
uh other riots

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,759
uh just click uh here uh there's a full

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,400
lecture

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,960
on the whole situation so to sum it up

00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,039
again

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,400
mention it one more time making hardware

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,199
open it's really easy

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,120
um from a legal point of view just

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,440
publish it and do nothing else

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,800
and of course use a copyright based

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,960
license to share

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,319
your editable documentation or design

00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,199
files to make

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,880
proper open source hardware and make it

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,800
easy for others then to build upon your

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,720
work

00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,319
so but how to deal then with the fact

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,759
that you can tell others what they can

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,759
do with your design and but not

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,360
that there is no copy left for example

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,680
and the answer is simply

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,960
live with it and design your business

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,400
strategy accordingly

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,080
you know if people would understand that

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,160
we would have a really healthy open

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,039
hardware licensing situation the problem

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:36,160
is

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,919
most people don't for people this is not

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,840
easy to understand

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,680
and accept they they just don't like it

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,080
i think it just doesn't click

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,880
instead you find a lot of really really

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,880
weird things

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,240
out there that make the situation

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,440
heavily broken

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,360
and i want to show you two issues first

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,639
people think they can use a copyright

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,840
based license

00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:00,400
for their hardware ideas and

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,080
they even use copyright based licenses

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,240
with a non-commercial clause

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,759
and then call their work open source

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,440
there are a lot of prominent

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:11,520
examples that do this okay let me just

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,639
show you a little bit what's going on

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,080
there i think

00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,440
if you're interested in hardware and

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,599
making you have probably seen this

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,560
yourself that people use copyright based

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,199
licenses

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,720
next to their hardware in a way that

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,199
creates the impression

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,720
that this license is actually protecting

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,919
the hardware

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,000
and usually they are under the

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,840
impressions in themselves

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,440
and you find this even on so-called

00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,160
maker platforms that no

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,080
should know better i'll show you uh an

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,479
example here on instructables which is a

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,960
very

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,599
old platform for this here you see a

00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,759
simple

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,800
hardware project and look up here in the

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,520
corner

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,560
there's a creative commons license and

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,120
if you click on this

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,560
then you see just the text of the

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,800
license

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,919
no explanation what this license

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,120
basically

00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:00,800
is for here's another example from an

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,479
upcoming maker platform called

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,840
wikifactory

00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,120
and here you see the same issue come on

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,199
please load

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:14,400
yes here is a drone and up here you see

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:16,080
there is a license uh also a creative

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,360
commons license and if you click on this

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,599
again you will find an

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,599
explanation of the license but not an

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:24,879
explanation what this licensee

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,520
actually uh is for or talks about

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,199
so tell me as an outsider without any

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,520
knowledge would you have thought that

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,360
these designs i just showed you are

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,760
protected by these licenses

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,640
how would you have interpreted this i

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,399
think

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,760
most people think yes of course the

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,880
license applies to the uh

00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,800
shown uh project but

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,160
um yeah and so people when they upload

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,160
something on instructables they will

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,399
think that their invention is protected

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,920
with this license but it is not

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,440
and i looked around at the instructables

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,640
website and i found only

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,480
one source where they actually explain

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,240
that this license is just about

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,519
documentation or not about the hardware

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,519
itself

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,519
and i show you this article

00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,360
[Music]

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,600
this information is here in the last

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,120
part of the article

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:19,200
the article is 11 years old

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:22,560
and has only 716 views in 11 years

00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,680
so it's basically hidden you know

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,240
and this is really really a problem

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,760
because it creates false expectations

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,080
among content creators

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,839
and more importantly it fosters false

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,000
motivations

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,880
people do not really understand how

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,640
sharing design

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,519
hardware design solutions on the web

00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,440
really works and how the law supports it

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,279
actually how the law supports us is

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,120
quite good it's basically

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,959
pretty much in favor of open source

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,360
hardware but people don't understand

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,360
this

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,640
and this means that their collaborative

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,000
potential is

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,519
locked to a big extent and i really

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,680
think that these platforms

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,360
need to be fixed they need to

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,200
communicate very clearly to their

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,399
content creators and the audience that

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,120
these licenses

00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,800
are about documentation and everyone

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,920
who's on that platform should really

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,920
understand

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,160
that if they put something there it

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,320
becomes free hardware everyone can make

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,720
with it whatever they want to

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,800
unless of course they have a patent or

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,560
design rights filed up front

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:27,839
or the designers some kind of artwork

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,120
yeah so uh maybe just one idea the

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,120
platform should write something like

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,279
this documentation is shared under a

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,480
creative commons license the hardware is

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,320
itself is not

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,839
and then put an explanation there so

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,640
that really the public

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,480
and content created creators gets uh get

00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,560
educated about the situation

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,160
and here's an even worse problem it's a

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,600
highly problematic form of the thing

00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,440
above you very often

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,040
in the world of hardware and making see

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,760
something like this this is a screenshot

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,560
from a

00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,120
company that shares something as it's a

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,560
table

00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:04,079
as open source under a creative commons

00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,000
non-commercial license

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,079
so people publish their work as open

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,959
source under non-commercial license this

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,399
is wrong

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,399
on so many levels and problems that

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,880
those levels start to interact with each

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,680
other

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,720
which then creates really bizarre and

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:22,720
harmful effects

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:25,120
to tackle this i created a couple of

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,160
months ago with the help of others

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,120
and fhq and i just want to show you a

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,640
little bit uh

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,000
some parts of this fhq to

00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,399
give you a little bit of of an

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,200
impression how big and weird

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,440
of a problem this is of course the fhq

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,760
starts here with the explanation that uh

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,880
non-commercial is not open source and

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,040
that all the

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,279
openness and open source definitions

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,399
explicitly allow

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,880
commercial use also free software and

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,680
then

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,160
i want to show you here um question

00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,440
number

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:02,160
seven you could ask this uh now also

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,160
i just explained to you why that

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,480
creative commons licenses because they

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,560
are copyright based don't apply to

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,160
hardware what's the problem then

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:15,519
and the problem is that um the law is no

00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:18,880
binary system you know um still can

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,399
people uh can sue you uh and claiming

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,920
that these uh

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,760
their copyright their creative commons

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,839
license indeed does

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,920
protect the hardware and then it goes to

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:31,040
court and there sits a judge

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,760
and he has to made a decision

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,040
and part of the decision that the judge

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,600
makes is to figure out

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,320
which law actually applies and there

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,120
could be

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,399
really weird situations where a creative

00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,639
commerce license

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,079
maybe still applies to your hardware

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,440
it's not very likely but if you're for

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,399
example an artist

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,040
it could work but the problem is that

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,120
you

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,480
have this legal risk that you have to go

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,839
to court and this

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,959
takes a lot of time energy money and who

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,920
would want it

00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,959
you know the lego brick for example is a

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,680
functionality

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:06,399
it had a patent and that patent expired

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,040
and then

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,880
lego tried for decades in courts to

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,399
still protect it with other forms of

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:15,040
property rights for example

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,000
with three-dimensional trademarks all of

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,760
this failed

00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,760
but it was uh more than a decade

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,839
fight in court and who would want to go

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,040
to court you are right but you know who

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,680
wants to spend this time

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,519
so it's a legal risk that you get sued

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,839
and this legal risk is some kind of

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,880
thin layer of protection who wants to go

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,720
to court if you

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,240
if you want to change the world or make

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,680
just a cool hardware project

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,839
and the second thing is that you enter

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,120
 territory because the people

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:45,199
misuse um an uh creative commons license

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,760
to signal hey i don't want you to use

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,480
this

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:49,360
uh in any way and especially not

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,120
commercially

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,399
you have all rights to do this but if

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,480
you do it

00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,079
then maybe you will get a storm

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,680
because the public doesn't know that you

00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:58,800
have the right and that what you do is

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,199
the right thing

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,639
they will think uh you're an uh

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,639
they will not understand and there's a

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,720
very prominent example here where

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,720
makerbot who was started as an open

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,680
source company and then they made a move

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,040
who was uh closing something but this

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,440
move was 100

00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:17,680
legitimate but the people just don't got

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,160
it and make a bot received a big

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,320
storm

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,440
unjustified and here's a story about

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,079
cory from uh

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,199
conductor who explains you this so this

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,680
is another uh

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,399
threat that is out there that you might

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,680
be seen

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:34,880
as an while you are not um so

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,480
those two things are basically a form of

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,399
protection

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,600
and the second thing is a scope

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:44,160
explosion

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,480
yes remember that a patent can only last

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,680
for

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:51,440
25 years while copyright law lasts

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,360
up to 70 years and if you now say hey

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,560
copyright back actually protects my

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,199
hardware you

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,560
calmly try to extend the the time of

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:02,880
protection for your hardware

00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:05,360
for more than 50 years and you extend a

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,600
scope because you can get a patent just

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,320
for things that are new but copyright as

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,320
i told you

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:14,800
can apply to also to remix of old ideas

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,639
and i want to show you here one of the

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,040
very really weird examples

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,839
there are this is group they make this

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,399
xyz

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,839
tables and bikes and they of course make

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,480
this strange move

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,680
it's open source under a non-commercial

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,320
license

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,360
but what actually do they want to

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,880
protect here

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,399
is it that xyz connection that's really

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,880
all here's just one

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,800
uh one example of more than 100 years

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,120
ago the famous reed field chair

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,040
used this xy that connection or is it

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,959
that they use standard beams you can get

00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,199
in every hardware store

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,120
so there is no way they can protect this

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,279
with with our given law but they

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,399
misuse the creative commons license to

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,199
pretend

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,880
they own this and therefore they take

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:01,600
something that belongs to all of

00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,160
us and try to make it exclusively here

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,639
theirs

00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,720
so you can really steal with the misuse

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,519
of a creative commons license

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,959
from the comments and yet those people

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,959
call their projects

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,959
open source so

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,680
yeah that's i think the proper reaction

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,959
there

00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,519
so um uh yeah

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,040
these two problems are really heavy so

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,120
what to do about it um

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,480
and i thought maybe we could try uh some

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,920
collective action

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:37,839
to clean the situation

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,880
uh and i to fix it so i created a

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,639
campaign

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,880
i launched it this morning and i just

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,199
want to show you a little bit uh

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,920
what it is it's not very complex but you

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,440
can maybe

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,160
join it um here the campaign of course

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,519
it can

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,560
explains a little bit of what is the

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:57,920
problem here and then there are these um

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,680
little memes non-commercial is not open

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:01,680
source

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,759
and here's then are the memes about the

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,679
documentation

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,799
and maybe that helps i think when i

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,360
entered this world

00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,799
10 years ago and if i had seen a meme

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,319
like that on the web it would have made

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,079
me think and i would probably have

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,679
understood quite quickly what's going on

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:19,679
here um

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:20,880
maybe uh and here is uh the proposal for

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,679
the collective campaign

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,079
first of all uh the memes i just showed

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,160
you

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,679
share them post them send them whenever

00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,360
you see someone uh

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,960
uh doing a wrong thing or uh aim of

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,720
trying to claim property rights for

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,320
something they can claim property rights

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,080
for using a creative commons license

00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:42,240
just calmly post one of these uh uh

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,280
one of these uh gifts or memes maybe

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,240
that would help you can add an

00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,080
explanation

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,000
or just post it without an explanation i

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,080
think this would work equally well

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,760
the second thing you could do um i had

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,440
the pleasure to work many years with the

00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,000
openness activist uh

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,840
sam your head and he made a really bold

00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,960
move whenever he saw someone on the web

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,880
posting something as

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,039
open source using a non-commercial

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,360
license he just wrote them a personal

00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,919
email this email was very friendly but

00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,799
strong

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,720
worded and very precise he explains what

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,760
the situation is and how to fix it

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,840
and he told me usually with success and

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:18,320
i think let's all be brave like sam

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,200
if you see a project like this uh sam

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,760
was uh

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,799
very um cool i asked him to share this

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,600
um

00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,320
email on the web and here is we can all

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,320
use it

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,840
and copy it and send it to those

00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,160
projects and ask them

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,440
please change the license please stop to

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,760
mis-educate

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,200
the public about how open source works

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,320
and what it actually is

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,480
uh for um yeah

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,120
it's very well written and then the the

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,200
third thing maybe the biggest um

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,480
thing but maybe the most promising lever

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,840
let's just all ask

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,400
uh the platforms um send them

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,320
uh an email and ask them please change

00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,720
your communication maybe put it

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,400
to turn into something like this this

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,160
documentation is shared under

00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,520
a creative commons license but this

00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,600
license does not apply to the

00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,720
documentation but usually

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,400
and not to the documented project itself

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,160
and then have a little info link and

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,120
really educate everyone

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,080
what's the situation and that the stuff

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,559
on the platform

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:20,320
is probably free hardware and we all can

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,200
explore it commercially

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,520
build upon it freely and this is a great

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,919
thing

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,600
and they should really uh embrace this

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,440
uh if you want to send this email it

00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,039
would be awesome uh i also created an

00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,160
email template uh

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,039
i can't write as that well uh as good as

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,919
sam your head

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,880
so maybe you have to um rewrite my

00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,200
little email here

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,320
uh but you can also use it as this and i

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,480
think if a couple of us

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,600
maybe send this email maybe they start

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,720
uh thinking and change this

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,840
communication i think

00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,080
this could change really really really a

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,080
lot

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,640
just a little uh reminder if we did this

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,080
the campaign

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,679
successfully the problem

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:12,559
some parts of the problems would be

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:15,120
solved but not everything

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,400
but it would be an important step i just

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,159
want to

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,320
remind you that i explained about that

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,280
the problem is that in software the

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,400
situation is

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:27,120
always clear there is copyright

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,400
and there is a standard way to deal with

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,480
it and make it open

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,600
so open source software licenses you see

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,080
a piece of software

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,360
you know there's a way to figure out the

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,880
intention of the creators

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,400
you find a license or not and then

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,200
you're good to go the problem with

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,240
hardware is

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,960
that it's not clear if there

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,280
are any proper opportu property rights

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,000
at

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,559
all and if there's uh if there are some

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,720
files

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,760
which one you just can't know if this is

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,400
free or

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,360
someone has a patent or a design rights

00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,960
unless you

00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:01,760
spend a lot of time researching uh this

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,000
so and even if it would be free or if it

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,480
would

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,480
be closed there is just no standard way

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,480
to signal to the outside world

00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,240
what is the case so you have no way to

00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,400
figure out what's the situation

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,400
is this uh free uh free software and as

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,840
a creator a free hardware as a creator

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,039
free hardware you have no standard way

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,440
to signal to people

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,200
hey this is really free hardware i never

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,799
filed a patent i will never file design

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,200
rights you can do with it whatever you

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,840
like

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:27,440
please do um and i think this is uh

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,200
something we could we should discuss in

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,799
the open source hardware community

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,159
what should could be a standard way

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,880
maybe there's a standard way i'm not

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,400
aware of

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,240
but yeah how standard can it be when i'm

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,919
not really aware of

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,559
i just show you how we do this with our

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,280
little design studio

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,320
we created uh this public promise which

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,960
is a little bit

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,960
like a like a license of course not

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,000
checked by a lawyer but in this public

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,400
promise

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
we just explained that we will never

00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,400
ever

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,080
file a patent which would not work for

00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,480
our staff anyway and we will

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,440
never make use of our design rights in

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,360
what way and that we want this um

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,960
statement to be legally binding for us

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,600
so this is our way to give people the

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,640
freedom

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,960
hey there's this is really open and we

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,120
want you to do visit whatever you see

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,760
fit and we put this uh

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,200
public promise on design rights uh below

00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,960
here next to our creative commons

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,840
license which of course applies to all

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,600
our articles

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,000
and the documentation of our hardware

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,760
and campaign projects and so on

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
um yeah but is this a way is

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,600
an idea for a standard way i'm not sure

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,440
i mean it's just a

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,760
how we do this but maybe this there

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,159
could be a fruitful discussion

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,480
yeah thank you for listening and i just

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:44,000
want to uh

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,600
highlight one more time why this is

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,400
important uh

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,720
open hardware could really be an super

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,720
important and fantastic tool to deal

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,080
with the challenges that will uh we will

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,960
have to face in the future

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,159
climate change biodiversity collapse uh

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,039
resource exchange

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:03,039
exhaustion we need open hardware could

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,080
really help with it but open hardware is

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,159
really

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,280
not enabled to grow and one of the big

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,840
reasons is that there are these weird

00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,760
misunderstandings

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,480
about the licensing about the legal

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:18,080
situation unless this is fixed

00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:20,799
uh open hardware cannot really make huge

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,000
next steps you can argue that the whole

00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,880
free software and open source

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,200
software uh movement started with this

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,600
uh

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,440
legal hacked of the of the uh do public

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,640
license that it started from a legal

00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,760
situation

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,159
and uh there is no similar situation

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,760
here in hardware and this is um really a

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,480
problem and i think this is a

00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,760
an interesting lever if we want to push

00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,400
open hardware forward

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,400
thank you for your uh attention please

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,919
join the campaign if you like it uh

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:52,240
let's do something let's clean up the

00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,240
web and uh move towards a better world

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,600
thank you lars what an inspiring

00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,400
endpoint point to finish on thank you

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,640
and

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,919
we have one question so far already for

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,240
lars

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,400
don't be shy i'm going to point where i

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,440
think the chat box may be which is there

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,480
if i'm mirrored

00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,679
and there if i'm not mirrored and my

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,159
first question then

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,960
to you lars comes from sriram which is

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,200
about the

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,120
open web foundation licenses which are

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,840
designed specifically for open hardware

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,559
apparently

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,120
do you recognize these licenses as being

00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:26,240
valid

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,640
in your case and if not why not i must

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,520
say

00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,279
that uh actually i might have been an

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:32,480
educational holder i don't know these

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,360
licenses

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,559
but if they are copyright based uh which

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,400
is

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,320
i don't know them but it's probably the

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,159
case that they are copyright based um

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,760
then they it's the same with the

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,520
creative commons licenses there's also

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,240
discern open hardware

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,720
license there are licenses that are made

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,559
for

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,400
open hardware but they're all if you

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,760
really read them carefully are made for

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,320
the copyrighted parts

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,640
so for the design files but not for the

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,200
hardware itself and this confusion

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:03,120
confusion is really something we need to

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,440
tackle

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,240
interesting and a question from me then

00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,640
you said that

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,760
making your hardware open requires doing

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,919
nothing except

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,000
publishing it in public but what does

00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,159
that mean if you don't have

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,279
digitized artifacts already like cad

00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,240
files or

00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:21,760
or similar similar documents how can you

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,320
how can you do that effectively so it's

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,320
in the comments

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:30,080
i mean uh when you can

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,320
post it on facebook post it in a

00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,240
facebook group about um

00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,360
about hardware and making post it on

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,200
twitter you know

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,960
just make sure that it's relatively

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,600
prominent because uh if you're

00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,760
if you try to file a patent is someone

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,279
and checks if this invention is already

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,679
out there in the world

00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,279
and um now nowadays the world is so

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,559
complex that no one can really

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,120
see every source and maybe then your

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,400
patent

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:58,720
is um is granted although it uh what you

00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,640
try to patent is already prior art

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,960
uh but then you will win in court you

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,919
can show no i really made this public uh

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,799
in this facebook group uh two years ago

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,679
and so on

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,400
and uh there a lot of people are afraid

00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:12,640
that

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,720
large companies come and steal their

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,799
ideas and then they patent it

00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,559
which i have never heard of a case where

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,240
this actually happens because

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:21,919
it really doesn't make sense for a large

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,320
company to do this

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,760
mostly because they would lose in court

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,080
and usually they are really

00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,840
uh well equipped with engineers they can

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,720
just recreate the idea in a little bit

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,640
different way

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,559
instead of taking the legal risk there

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,039
to to go with you to court and lose it

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,279
and then

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:40,320
have a lot of damage to their public

00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,320
appearance and so on

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,799
thank you so so if there's no digital

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,400
files then uh

00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,400
you might i mean it is publishing

00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,120
photographs or a long description of the

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,799
the process the mechanical items if it's

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,400
not a printed circuit board or you don't

00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:57,360
have the files for that

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,159
what's the minimum criteria to qualify

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,600
as being

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,600
published in the commons would you say

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,039
i don't know everything you can come up

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:09,840
with to explain

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,720
what your your idea your functionality

00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,559
is

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,840
i mean some people say that uh having an

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,320
a patent is

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,000
uh basically also an open source file

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,440
which is not the case because you can

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,039
see a patent it describes the

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,799
functionality but it will not

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,480
often not help you to actually build the

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,399
device

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,200
but this also teaches us that a very

00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:32,480
minimal description of the mechanism

00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:35,760
or your idea should cover

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,480
cover you and really make it public

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,240
was it clear yes i think so thank you so

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,039
i'll follow up with another question

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:44,640
um yeah so you mentioned the design and

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,720
utility rights that

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,720
can augment the other kinds of rights

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,919
and means of protecting the the freedom

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,159
of your open hardware

00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,840
to what degree are those internationally

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,080
enforceable i think you mentioned

00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,480
uh they might be specific to germany or

00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,000
how does that work

00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,240
yeah i know that they're in europe

00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,520
there's this uh design rights for

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:08,559
things uh that uh how something looks

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:10,960
and um and and uh

00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:13,200
as i said i really didn't research how

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,960
for example is the situation in japan or

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,039
in mongolia for example but i'm pretty

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,520
sure that discovers the situation in in

00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,000
europe

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,159
that we have this utility uh models and

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,559
this uh design rights

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,600
um so throughout the european union

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,919
member states

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:30,080
we can be confident that we can fall

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,440
back on those if we first apply for them

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,559
and are granted them for our hardware

00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,320
projects

00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:35,840
pretty much that's how what how i

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,960
understood it yeah

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:41,039
great and is there a way of requiring

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,679
derivative works of open hardware

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,559
projects

00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:46,799
to remain in the commons similar to how

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:49,919
copyleft works with software

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:52,399
yeah and that's that's the issue no

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,279
no there is not and that's maybe the

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:56,640
biggest

00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:58,799
problem people have it's really

00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,399
you can post something then it's uh open

00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,000
a functionality and someone can take

00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:03,039
your functionality and make a little

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,120
extra invention

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:07,279
on top that only works because there is

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,919
this space and then this person can

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,960
close it

00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:13,039
for everyone including yourself uh

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,120
but that's the way there is no way to

00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,360
way around this there is just no way to

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,279
fix it there's only one way to fix it uh

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,480
change your expectation deal with the

00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,640
fact that this

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,240
won't ever happen and then design your

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,960
business strategy or your hardware

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,039
strategy

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,200
around this fact live with it whatever

00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,480
we do is designed like this we are happy

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,159
we know that we have

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:36,080
no way to really put any conditions out

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,760
there what people do with our stuff

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,279
and and that's really the key message

00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,399
here we have to

00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:44,399
live with it and then start to design

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,559
the discussion and everything from there

00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,399
and that would be a fantastic point

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,600
because it might look at the first oh

00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,440
okay then i lose my

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,520
invention but it also means there are so

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,600
many inventions you can use

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,520
for free build on them you know you have

00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,080
so much freedom from this we all

00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,520
it's it's a it's a win for all of us but

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,360
that's the thing that's so hard for

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,440
people to understand i think

00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,399
so prior art gives you no defense in

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,520
that case like

00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:10,880
can you it can be so iterative so

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,200
minutes an extension

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,799
in the hardware field that uh another

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,440
company can get a patent

00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:20,080
even if uh prior art exists for your

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,640
your previous iteration of the work

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,120
yes for example you are let's say you

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,760
have a

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,640
nuts and bolts are prior art for for

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,399
centuries now

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,880
but still someone could come up with a

00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:32,880
new uh way to have a uh

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,320
to make the mechanism on top i just

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,159
can't find the word right now

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,720
they can patent this of course then you

00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,640
have this specific form of nut or bold

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,159
uh is then closed again it's possible

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,200
always yeah

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:47,360
and live visit that's the key message

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,399
i have another question for you then um

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,080
about the

00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:53,600
uh legal recourse when um

00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,720
yeah like you've mentioned a few

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,320
different ways of reaching out to

00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,440
organizations who are claiming copyright

00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,760
covers

00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,120
uh open hardware which in fact it

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,480
doesn't is there any

00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,919
is there any alternative uh any any more

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,919
maybe for those organizations who don't

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,279
reply like you seem to have experienced

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,559
yourself because you've sent notices to

00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,039
some of those websites you shared

00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:13,120
earlier

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,039
but they're still claiming uh creative

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,519
commons licenses for hardware files and

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,159
so on

00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,720
is there any other recourse or any other

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,840
option

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,880
to to push or or let's say coerce those

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,080
organizations into uh ceasing to claim

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,720
something that isn't true about the

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,120
licensing of their hardware

00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,399
uh not that i know of i mean who wants

00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,880
to sue them

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:37,360
or you know who wants to go there no i

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,880
mean just uh ask them politely and um

00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,039
that's what's so fantastic about this

00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,240
text by sam he told me that it usually

00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,919
worked you know not

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,000
not always but it usually worked and

00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,159
maybe that's also maybe the experiment

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,559
with these memes you know look at these

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,960
memes and what they try to subtle

00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:54,080
communicate maybe this also helps push

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,559
people

00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,799
uh uh across the edge and really make

00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,799
sure

00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,840
great

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,760
