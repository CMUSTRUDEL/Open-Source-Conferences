Title: #FOSSBack: Dirk Riehle - First Ph.D. Then Startup
Publication date: 2021-03-02
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	As a professor, I want to create open source startups with my doctoral (Ph.D.) students. To that end, I have set up courses and a whole program. Frankly, there is no better place than Germany to get started, as public funding can carry you through the research well into Series A territory. In this talk, I'll explain how I try to give my students their Ph.D. and help them turn their research work into a startup.

	00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,559
so welcome to my talk

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,960
my name is dougla i'm a professor of

00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,360
computer science in germany

00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,639
at a german university and my goal is to

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,520
show you that it's

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,000
not hard to have a startup maybe an open

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,119
source

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,039
uh startup if you know how to use the

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,760
academic system

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,160
along the way but not necessarily so you

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,920
can

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:33,040
get a phd that can but must not go ahead

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,840
can doesn't have to go hand in hand so

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,120
why

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,000
well so some of you may remember this

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,640
fabulous

00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,480
south park cartoon where there's

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,680
something you love to do

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,440
these are the gnomes uh something you

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,520
love to do like perform research or

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,039
solve challenging technical problems but

00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,640
you also want to make money meaning

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,360
there's a profit and you want to earn a

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,920
living

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,879
so the challenge is how do you go from

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,160
something you have

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:03,120
passion for to well

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,920
well having a profit i say earning your

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,320
living

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:11,760
and the idea is here that if you were to

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,560
get a position at a german university

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,119
the setup is such that you can fairly

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,240
easily in my book

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:24,560
use that to develop

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,880
software that can feed into a startup

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,479
and it's actually quite comfortable so

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,400
so part of my story here

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,079
is it does not have to be painful you

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,680
don't have to be suffer you you don't

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,000
have to suffer you don't

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,040
have to only have two meals a day or

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,560
something

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,280
because um at least in germany uh you

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,240
can get a fully salaried position at the

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,479
university

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,640
most computer science professors have

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:52,320
plenty of positions available

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,240
and that is fully salaried at 50k a year

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,680
so that's not a stipend that's a real

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,360
salary

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,360
um you get to experience university life

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,719
but you have a project that you get

00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,159
employed on

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:08,959
where you can both own your skills

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,959
or develop open source software if you

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,720
choose the right professor

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,879
well then because it's open source

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,080
software maybe you will find users maybe

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:19,360
you understand needs

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,680
of users maybe ultimately

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,840
you can turn this initial open source

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,280
software over time into something

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,599
for a startup there's a lot more here to

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,640
say

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,480
than my five minutes will let me do but

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,840
you can build out a startup team there

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,959
will be other people

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:40,400
like you like-minded and

00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:43,440
in parallel but again you don't have to

00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:47,280
but you can if you want to

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,680
follow say a design science approach

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,400
which is a particular way of

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,239
also performing research on top of that

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,160
software you're developing

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,480
where along the way you identify a

00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:02,000
problem you find solutions for that

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:04,640
problem you find a way of

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,120
evaluating that and write a dissertation

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,920
which is the requirement

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,080
for that title if you are after the

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,480
title

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,239
the way it works at a university is very

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,560
much like an open source even

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,000
if for whatever reason your professor

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,480
doesn't let you develop open source

00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,519
software the style of collaboration is

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,680
like it

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:30,879
is like uh in open source because

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,440
most of the time a research associate

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,879
called listen schaffler here metabytes

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:38,000
this and shaftly hibitab

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:40,720
in in german will

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,440
be an architect or a main developer of a

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,720
system but work with master students so

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,200
they are

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,280
the quality assurance the code

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,159
integrators so they

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,879
delegate work they get work from

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,720
students

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,400
they are responsible for the

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,519
architecture they are the committees

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,000
of an open source project even if it's

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,439
not even

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,720
open source they were developing

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,799
at the same time so being a phd student

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,480
that's the other aspect of being at a

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,920
university if you want to do

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,400
research can be a lot of fun so usually

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,239
people

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,639
join me or i'm able to hire people

00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:22,160
because they want to get a phd

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:28,320
and that can mean academic conferences

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:30,720
and far away places worth a lot of fun

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,639
but at some point of time where you have

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,800
done all your development work and you

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,199
have written a few research papers and

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,840
written

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,479
a citation you will have to spin off

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,120
your work

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:45,199
into a software startup and here

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,520
that is my particularly particular

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,680
expertise i can help you

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,360
turn that into a commercial open source

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,800
software startup

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,080
um i won't go into details given my five

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,120
minutes but i

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,039
will you will have to find that team

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,560
help build that team or maybe you're

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,800
joining a team

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,800
go through what makes a startup which is

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,000
understanding your customers

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,400
and defining what it is they need and

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,759
getting the funding to turn the software

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,960
from the university

00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,039
which may already be really far into a

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,000
real product

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,240
there's a lot of funding in germany so

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,080
even after you got your phd and leave

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,120
university with a startup

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,759
you don't have to either earn money

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,080
right away

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,039
from your product or have a venture

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,240
capitalist

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,120
uh take half your company no there's a

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,000
lot of

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,520
public funding to keep you going so you

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,680
get to keep

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,840
the intellectual so you get to keep your

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,520
equity it remains

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,000
much longer than say in the silicon

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,479
valley it remains your company and

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,520
meaning

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,160
your values count and it's again your

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,479
company

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,400
these are just examples of way of

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,919
getting money and it feeds

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:05,520
teams of three four five people for

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:09,199
a year or and a half and then you can

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,960
chain these so what the startup act

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,120
actually eventually does how it's

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,319
structured how aggressive it is how

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,759
profit oriented

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:21,120
how socially oriented that's up to you

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:25,759
but again my message here is

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:28,639
find a professor that professor has

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,039
the means to channel the funds to you

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,360
the public grants because

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,240
at least the country of germany really

00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,319
wants you

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,280
to start those open source software to

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:40,240
start those

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,919
startups but then in my book open source

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,960
software startups because that's the

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,000
perfect way

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,319
of how you do it from university

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,440
here's my contact information i see

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,479
something about

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,039
slides uh coming along

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,360
my slides are available on my website

00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,720
here so go to

00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:02,479
thegrila.com and there's also a course

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:17,840
on commercial open source software

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:17,840
startups so

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,639
