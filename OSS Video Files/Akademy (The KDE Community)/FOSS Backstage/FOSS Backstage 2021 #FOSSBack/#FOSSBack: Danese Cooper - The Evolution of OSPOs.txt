Title: #FOSSBack: Danese Cooper - The Evolution of OSPOs
Publication date: 2021-03-01
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	The concept of Open Source Program Offices or OSPOs is a familiar one within the corporate open source world. A growing number of governments, cities and universities have now also identified the benefits of OSPOs. However, public sector OSPOs tend to have a different set of priorities to Corporate OSPOs. While at Sun Microsystems, Danese Cooper set up one of the first OSPOs, just a few months after the term Open Source was coined. In this session, Danese will give an update on OSPO trends, explore how public sector OSPOs can differ from corporate OSPOs, and share how OSPOs can enable global collaboration to scale impact, and achieve public policy goals.

hi

00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,719
there um this is a hastily done

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,559
presentation because i only heard i was

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,559
doing this recently

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:15,599
but i'm happy to talk about this topic

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:18,080
because

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,560
ospos are near and dear to my heart

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,519
you'll learn more about that in a minute

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,039
it's a growing trend although those of

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,720
us in the tech world have known about

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,359
them for a long time

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,119
and so let's begin if you have questions

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,520
please put them in the chat

00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,719
and we will have a q a at the end so if

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,640
i say anything that

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,399
bothers you know let me know all right

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,480
here we go

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:41,680
so first of all here's a little timeline

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,000
to get us started

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,120
um you'll notice and this is not to

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,960
scale

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,480
time wise you know where the actual

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,920
things land because

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,399
the free software foundation was of

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,199
course years ahead of the rest of us

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,280
in recognizing the opportunity of uh

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,359
what we now call open source

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,320
back then it was called free software

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,039
exclusively

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,239
and there was reasons for that but in

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,439
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,200
the term open source was coined by some

00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,240
folks at a meeting that was convened by

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,560
o'reilly

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,159
and o'reilly publishing and o'reilly

00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,680
also published a book

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,080
that was essays by the prominent players

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,680
in the free software movement the reason

00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,840
they sought a change of name

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,040
was of course because free is an

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,880
ambiguous term

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:32,079
in english it means both gratis and

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,840
and free as in freedom and

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,840
that fears and freedom is kind of what

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,159
richard stallman meant but

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,920
there was confusion and it was causing

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,479
some problems in the business community

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,000
which

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,439
tim o'reilly noticed and others had

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,240
noticed as well in 1998 also mozilla

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,840
was the first corporation to ever create

00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,439
an open source project

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,840
um volitionally you know as a strategy

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,360
and they of course had a group that got

00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,600
together to talk about

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,880
building that license and the terms

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,000
under which they would work

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,280
and that could be considered um

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,239
the first the first office

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,720
around an open source thing in

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:16,000
corporation

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,080
however linux had been going for a while

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,080
and there were several sort of linux

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,640
clubs inside of

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,319
the leading tech corporations and i know

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,280
because i was in one at apple

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,000
in the early 90s you know not too long

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,599
after

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,519
linux was founded and i know b del

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,640
garvey was already um

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:37,360
puttering around with it at hp but i

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,000
i actually believe i started the first

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,959
corporate

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
ospo or the first ospo and the reason

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,239
that we called it an

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,760
ospo which stands for open source

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,000
program office

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,920
is because sun was really big on program

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,959
offices there were program offices for

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,440
everything

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,120
and so since i was going to focus on

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,959
open source i was hired in

00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,200
in early 99 we set me up in office

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,440
and we started talking about it that way

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,120
and it's an obvious acronym i don't

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,599
think it was particularly clever

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,840
but it seems to have stuck because that

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:13,200
is the term that is generally used now

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,040
um sun needed an ospo because they were

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,280
making a big bet in open source

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,959
now going on through the timeline and by

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,239
2000 most of the

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:25,280
deep tech companies already

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,920
had an ospo and that's only a year later

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,159
but you know

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:32,239
hp ibm intel even microsoft

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,760
it was not very functional hospital at

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,760
that point but they had one

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,280
uh novell and apple i know for sure had

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,879
there i may have missed a few and i'm

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,040
not trying to be exhaustive here but the

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,879
idea is there were a handful

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,799
and they were mostly you'll notice

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,560
companies that worked in

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,120
operating systems and particularly

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,159
around unix

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,200
so what came right after that was

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,760
a gradual expansion that by 2010

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,760
seemed to us in the open source world

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:03,360
like a landslide

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:07,040
2010 is when i worked on my way out of

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,920
the working on um

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,319
the open source initiative and so i did

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,439
that

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,439
for 10 years and i you know i i worked

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,120
at out of it because i was too busy at

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,880
that point i was the cto of wikipedia

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,040
and that was taken up all my time

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,960
but also it looked to me like it was an

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,160
inevitability that open source was going

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,320
to prevail

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,000
we'd been through a few rounds of

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,520
arguing about whether the licensing

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,120
needed to change whether open source

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,000
definition needed to change

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,280
but the fact that money was starting to

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,440
accumulate behind

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:42,720
osbos was a pretty big deal right um

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,160
so then in 2015 open source won

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,240
in the marketplace um as in we stopped

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,560
having traditional enemies

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,320
and uh mostly we stopped having

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,400
microsoft as a traditional enemy that's

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,880
the year that satya nadella became

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,479
the ceo of microsoft that's also the

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,360
year that stephen vaughn nichols

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,639
uh wrote his famous paper that basically

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,320
said open source says one

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:09,520
get over it um and then

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:13,039
in 2020 we saw the

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:16,080
and second wave of the rise of the ospo

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,840
and this i would argue is a new kind of

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,360
ospo it's a little bit different than

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,039
the corporate ospo

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,960
corporate osbos are very deeply

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,639
discussed in places like the to do group

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,240
at the linux foundation

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,400
but the ospo plus plus as a concept

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,000
is about the institutionality of the

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,199
existence of ospos

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,639
being helped or being used as a way to

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,280
help

00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:41,120
municipalities and academia to join this

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,440
movement

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,759
more largely you know like mit has been

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,639
doing open courseware for a long time

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,199
but most large research institutions in

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,479
the world

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:55,600
are not that deeply involved um the

00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,600
city of munich adopted open source and

00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,560
kicked out microsoft back in

00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,440
2000 2001 i think uh and they've gone

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,919
back and forth

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,639
as politics have you know prevailed

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,319
we're pro

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,479
we're pro microsoft we're not pro

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,639
microsoft we're pro microsoft again

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,400
um and we'll talk about that some more

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,280
but a broad

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,680
stroke like the european union in 2020

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,039
um

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,600
revealing that they were going to

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,919
recommend uh that there be

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,280
ospos all throughout the european union

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,560
at a municipal level

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,880
and a city-state level and that the

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,160
the federation of those city-states

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,199
which is the eu

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,000
was also going to engage in osbo as a

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,240
way of

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,080
getting the citizenry and all of the

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,680
people involved to understand the

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,000
potential of open source for

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,199
municipalities all right so that's the

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,680
basic timeline

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,280
that i'm going to talk through now i

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,479
already said that we started the first

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,400
hospital sun

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,479
let me say a little bit more about why

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,800
that was important to us

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:56,400
at the dawn of open source there were

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,800
still a fair number of people

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,880
trying to define what that meant the

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,520
free software folks wanted a complete

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,440
graph

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,599
of what they had to say including the

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,880
political manifesto that came with that

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,160
back in that era but there were other

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,880
people who thought that they could do a

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,520
better job

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,960
one of them was bill joy who was the

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,680
chief scientist of sun

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,599
and of course founded the bsd project

00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,680
while he was a grad student at cal

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:24,240
and therefore wrote the bsd license

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,520
right so he had credit credentials

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,599
um he believed that the

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,039
that open source as originally conceived

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,280
was not going to work very well

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,599
in corporate settings there had been a

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,520
commitment made not by bill joy to open

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,680
source java

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,440
in thinking through how he could do that

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,000
or how that could be done in a way that

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,479
wouldn't

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,400
seed control because corporations were

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,919
all about control back then

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,599
they came up with a blade and spoke

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,160
model license called

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,879
the scuzzle or sun community source

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,639
license

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,560
it was not an open source license it did

00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,319
not pass the osd

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,720
they tried to make a hail mary play to

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,599
say look we love you little open source

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,120
initiative but

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,879
we have longer experience and we think

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,080
it should happen this other way and that

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,560
was unsuccessful

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,680
thankfully i was actually hired to

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,639
defend this guzzle

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,120
and i only did it for six months before

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,960
i

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,800
was convinced by the community that this

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,039
was the wrong way to go about it

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,560
and i became a true believer and this is

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,280
something that happens over and over

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,639
again

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:30,080
in corporations where people become ospo

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,680
spokespeople they they um often

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,919
drink the kool-aid and whatever the

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,080
corporate agenda is over the history of

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,200
aspas whatever the corporate agenda is

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,519
it starts to morph

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,880
in the person of that person so that

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,200
happened to me

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,959
and um i actually quit son it's because

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,720
i was tired of being told that

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,480
we weren't doing things right and i

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,200
couldn't seem to influence them to

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,120
change it

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,959
but at the time they were interested in

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,399
keeping me at sun

00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,320
more than they were interested in being

00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:59,120
right about that and so

00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,680
they offered me an opportunity to open

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,839
an

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,720
espo and open source program office in

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,959
order to

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,160
create a more authentic open source at

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,480
sun and

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,440
help educate people and hopefully change

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,080
minds of people

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,360
leaders like bill joy so that's why we

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,760
did it

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,640
um so now we're going to talk about the

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:21,680
age of the paleolithic ospo

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,680
these are the big moves in prehistory uh

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,120
and this is a piece of paleolithic art

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,240
of uh

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:30,000
cave face in uh france

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,080
famously so this is the beginning of

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,760
prehistory first time humans

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:39,360
do something that we can date um ospo's

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:42,399
at this time were mostly about

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,839
legal encumbrant and um

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,040
attention to detail that for-profit

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,760
software and not get

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,440
sucked into what was seen as a

00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,480
problematic licensing model

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,040
in the copyleft licenses now for the

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,640
record

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,320
i don't think that copyleft is

00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,519
problematic i think that there are some

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,079
really good reasons to use

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,760
copyleft i i am a member of the apache

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,920
software foundation as well and i

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,600
also have a deep belief in the right

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,480
times and reasons to use permissive

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,640
licensing

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,640
in the paleolithic period most of the

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,120
ospas were run by lawyers

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,760
including the sun osbo although i was

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,800
running it

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,880
i had an assigned lawyer whose job was

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:24,560
to keep me on the straight and narrow

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,680
and we did exhaustive readings of the

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,519
license text

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,880
and tried to understand it through the

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,240
lens of corporate

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,480
licensing and corporate contract law and

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,000
we grouped them into ones we were

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,600
willing to deal with the ones we weren't

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,040
willing to deal with one of those was

00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,880
the gpl

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,040
there was a blanket statement made that

00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,240
sun would never touch gpl

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,200
licensing and then only a year later we

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,240
licensed the

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,920
um open office project under the lgpl so

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,160
we were blowing through our own edicts

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,920
pretty quickly this was really really

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,519
common there was a lot of vanity

00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,360
licensing happening where

00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,200
companies were putting their names on

00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,120
licenses and then

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,640
throwing code over the wall apple did a

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,839
famous one of these when they switched

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:09,040
to the mock kernel

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,640
they um they created the darwin project

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,000
they hired some of the best engineers in

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,680
the bsd community

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,600
to run it and then they proceeded to

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,320
undermine that community by

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,399
tossing tar balls of each successive

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,279
build of the actual operating system

00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,120
over the wall and and you know blowing

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,800
up whatever the community was doing over

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,200
and over again until everybody left that

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,920
took about a year so in the paleolithic

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,959
time most

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:36,399
ospos were pretty broken

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:38,320
then came the mesolithic period of aspas

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,320
and this was a transition period this

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,480
this coincides with

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,240
the large growth that 10-year period of

00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:47,360
growth for ospos that i

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,079
between 2000 and 2010 we sort of you

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,320
know slid into the mesolithic

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,839
it became pretty clear that a vanity

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,079
license was a bad idea

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:59,519
because it didn't create interoperable

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:01,760
code it didn't promote code reuse

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,760
even some of the best you know

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,120
intentions like the mozilla project's

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,200
original license

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,040
instead of creating an olympic size pool

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,240
of code that could be reused

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:15,040
it basically created infinite

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,639
kiddie pools of code and that's because

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,120
of the way the license was written

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,000
it wasn't interoperable between versions

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,240
and so

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,720
the apple public license which was an

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,880
exact copy of the mozilla public license

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,360
made a separate pool of code i hope you

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,200
can understand what i'm saying there

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,600
there was some progress made some

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,000
notable progress made

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,200
starting with i think the open office

00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,360
project at sun

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,560
we started to show that open source

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,680
could

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,720
both satisfy a corporate greed

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:49,839
while also satisfying a human need

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,680
so the open source project known as

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:56,079
openoffice was built

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,760
to hurt microsoft full stop

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,279
that is what sun cared about that's why

00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,200
they spent the money

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,800
people like me that were helping

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,160
conceive of this project and pushing it

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,600
forward and designing it

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,360
we're looking for also a rise of the

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,320
boats around people being able to use

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,560
productivity

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,240
software without learning a new language

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,519
because microsoft is only supporting 13

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,160
languages worldwide

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,160
part of our strategy was to make sure

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,200
that people could localize open office

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,440
into their own

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,320
needed language and we had at one point

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,680
160 separate efforts to try to do that

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,600
wikipedia similarly you know is about

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,240
giving you the some of the world

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,279
knowledge in your own language and

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,279
um the truth is that sun didn't care

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:42,240
about that in your own language thing

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,120
except to the extent that it was pushing

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,240
their agenda

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,240
of scaring the pants off of microsoft by

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,760
you know getting substantial market

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,320
share away from them in a short period

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,000
of time

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,760
at 1.600 million copies of um

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,199
openoffice were downloaded every time we

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,199
turned to version so we're pretty

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:02,320
successful at that

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:04,880
another really fine example of an ospo

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,760
that was serving a corporation but doing

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,040
it creatively

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,160
was a google summer code where summer

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,600
code

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,120
both helped google in a material way but

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,920
google was not

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,440
giving away the secrets of their search

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,639
engine even though they were using gpl

00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,399
license code

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,160
they were using the loophole that they

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,079
weren't distributing that code they were

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,839
just performing it on their website

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,199
so they weren't legally required to give

00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,720
those changes

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,560
back but they were sort of aware that

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,040
they had a moral obligation

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,639
and they got interested in ways to make

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,639
the open source community better

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,680
directly through the efforts of their

00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,880
ospo

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,880
and thinking about how to grow the

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,720
pool of open source developers that were

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,680
available they thought wow there's all

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,560
those students that

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:52,720
in cs departments what if we made a cash

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,680
prize for them to come and be involved

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,720
in open source

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,240
over their summer and they um

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,399
you know we would pay them we would make

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,440
some minimum requirements of what

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,120
you know positive involvement looks like

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,800
oh and by the way since we're fast

00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,760
tracking them we probably need the

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,079
projects to agree so that it's not a big

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,720
you know for them so let's

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,880
include the projects in the planning get

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,279
them to agree to mentor a certain number

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,519
of students place the students with the

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,600
projects and then you know do some

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,079
analysis of how well they do

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,600
this also allowed in addition to helping

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,440
them with their open source reputation

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,320
it allowed them to preview some of the

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,720
best

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,519
up and coming open source ready

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,959
engineers

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,399
that were about to graduate from school

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,600
so it was also a recruiting thing for

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,240
them

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,360
so you know this is basically a way to

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,680
say to you

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,199
and ospo doesn't only have to protect

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,120
the corporation

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,880
but you also heard me say in the

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,560
mesolithic period

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,000
there was a fundamental shift in the

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,440
architecture of software towards

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,600
software as a service

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,639
so in the paleolithic period we were

00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,680
still shipping

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,800
shrink wrapping cds dvds

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,000
flappy disks of software and people were

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,320
going to fry's

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,639
and buying it off of a shelf and taking

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,360
it home and putting it in their computer

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,279
but by the mesolithic period i think

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,959
there started to be easier ways to get

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,639
software distributed

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,040
and some of them were not distributed at

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,519
all

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,880
like the linux use that google did they

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,959
were performant

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:26,880
and because the licenses were not

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,720
written to

00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,480
touch that performant issue with the

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,440
exception at this point of the affairo

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,920
gpl

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,560
or agpl that all the other licenses

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,680
didn't

00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,759
close that gap and so even the gp

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,600
even the copy left licenses were

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,320
fundamentally permissive as long as you

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,440
were just

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,440
performing so if you were shipping it in

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,880
a car in a vehicle that you were

00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,720
building like a lot of the

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,160
automakers did then you were in

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,000
violation of the gpl and

00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,399
the free software foundation continues

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,399
to track down people who violate the gpl

00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,720
and try to get them to understand

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,519
what that distribution trigger looks

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,959
like

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:07,199
but they've been slow to close that

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,480
that permissive um i'm sorry that

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,720
performance loop

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,160
and that allowed a lot of new companies

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,760
to set up ospos

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,240
make sure they stayed on the right side

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,000
of that loop but also

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,679
realize that they still had to give back

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,480
in some material way to stay on the

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,120
right side

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,559
morally of the open source community

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,760
okay

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,840
the third big wave of ospos is the

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,640
neolithic gospel

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,840
that is the sort of almost uh recorded

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,360
history

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,240
ospo and um this by the way is off of

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,400
newgrange and

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,000
ireland and the country i live in now

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,520
and uh i would say

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,520
that that the difference between

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,880
mesolithic and neolithic is

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,160
that now open source has won and we're

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,640
starting to see

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,400
companies like microsoft revisit the

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,160
activities of their ospo

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,640
i suppose are starting to show up

00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:02,000
everywhere in the industry at this point

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,320
and um even outside of the industry

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
starting to see some ospos so early

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,160
early adoption i suppose both in

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,799
academia and in cities happened much

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,240
earlier

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,720
but we're starting to see them become

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,160
more effective as we get into the

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,039
neolithic period

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,000
we're seeing um because open source has

00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:21,440
one there's an

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,160
there's a re-examination uh by the

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,919
by a new crop of businesses that want to

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,799
take advantage of the halo effect of

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,960
open source

00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,039
without actually dealing with all of the

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,160
requirements and osbos are

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:36,960
key to help educate people about

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,160
you know why that's wrong thinking what

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,760
direction to go

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,280
it also provides a single point of

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,240
contact to a burgeoning

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,480
open source developer pool for a company

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,480
that's trying to stay on top of things

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,760
and i think we're in the neolithic

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,919
period in the tech

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,600
industry still and we're going to be in

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,200
it for a while i think

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,000
but the real reason that we're doing

00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,240
this talk is to signal a modern era of

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,679
ospas yes that is burning man

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:06,960
notice it looks a little neolithic um

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,880
because what we have now is an interest

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:12,160
that in in a couple of sectors that have

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:15,120
never really shown deep interest before

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,559
in academia and also in municipalities

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,280
we're starting to see

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,240
a real interest in using open source but

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,400
they're not

00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,440
organized like traditional tech

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,000
companies who've been

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,840
able to mobilize engineering resources

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,520
and to build business models that

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,120
include open source as part of their

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,200
story

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,280
a lot of the reasons that these new

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,000
players are wanting to get into it is

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,840
because

00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,840
there's a lower cost of acquisition or

00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:41,840
perceived lower cost of acquisition

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,600
so all of that rhetoric that was very

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,919
common in the neolithic era

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,360
the cathedral and the bazaar is still

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,760
being read by these

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,000
new players and they're continuing to

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,480
kind of misunderstand what that means

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,520
they have some challenges which we'll

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,320
talk about in a minute

00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,000
in order to make this all work but we're

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,039
suggesting and i'll tell you who we are

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,679
in a minute

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:06,480
that we should be creating a network of

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,320
ospos for this type of customer

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,880
and the truth is tech ospos have been

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:13,919
networked a lot of us have hopped around

00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:17,600
between us but stormy peters has got the

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,840
definitely got the prize for the

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,720
most number of name-brand ospo's ever

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,480
worked in

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,159
right starting with hp and now she's at

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,200
microsoft but she was at three others in

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,280
between

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,400
um but all of us hop around i mean i

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,960
hopped around and

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,400
my last ospo job was only over two years

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,120
ago working for

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,840
paypal trying to get theirs together uh

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,840
lots of us

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,919
have engaged in consulting in between

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,640
our big gangs so we've done a lot of

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,760
small

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:47,039
holder helping as well but getting

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:50,400
ospos to work and open source to work

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:52,400
at scale in municipalities and

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,679
academia is going to require some

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,320
different

00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,039
tools and different ideas and different

00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,679
changes

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,880
there have been efforts to get open

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,400
source to work in

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:08,640
civic level before famously

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:10,640
there was um the code for america which

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,760
you know it was a really great effort

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,240
they learned a lot

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,559
they eventually had to retrench because

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,720
their original idea of open source for

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,919
the masses was sort of not working

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,400
partly because they were having a hard

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:25,679
time with requirements and expectations

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:29,600
um there were a lot of reasons but

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,200
um likewise it's exhausting work running

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,799
in osbo and people do

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:38,159
you know time out need to go re recharge

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:39,520
right um and another reason that it's

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,520
going to be different is

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,039
most of these entities don't actually

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,720
have their own programmers who are

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,720
persistent

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,240
open source kind of depends on a certain

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,640
amount of persistence

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,360
of at least the key players that's why

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,240
we built

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:56,080
at places like apache the you know

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,360
growing of responsibility as you

00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,120
distinguish yourself

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,799
because it makes it sticky for those

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,600
people um

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,159
but both municipalities and academia

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,520
have

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:10,320
like four years at best of

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,159
a workforce and then it shifts you know

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:13,840
and they tend to get very young workers

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,679
not not exclusively there definitely are

00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,520
municipalities with large

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,679
uh engineering organizations but they

00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,400
also tend to use a lot of body shops and

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:25,039
that is a really ephemeral workforce

00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,240
and so figuring out how to shift the

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,120
attitudes and teach

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,880
people how to do this in a different way

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,799
is it going to be a lot of the work of

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,600
the asper plus plus

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,360
so open source for public good

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,360
definitely not a new thing

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,120
spent a lot of us even though

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,360
enlightened self-interest is such a key

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,240
part of open source

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,120
trying to be good or trying to do good

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,120
while doing well

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,720
has been a thing the whole time starting

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,320
with open office in 2000

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:56,480
mozilla in 1999 they were trying to

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,000
98 they were trying to save their

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,559
company mozilla

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,320
but they were also trying to do a good

00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:06,080
thing apologies for the phone

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:09,679
sorry i'm in a hotel room um

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:12,080
but uh they

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,919
to get it to actually work open source

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,960
for public good that works is a

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,280
different thing

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,919
because you need that institutionality

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,640
you need to be able to convince

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,320
suits money lawyers others that this is

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,200
a sustainable thing that you're doing

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,919
that it's not just

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,679
fly by night it's not fringy people who

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,240
don't fit into society

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,360
now as open source has won and moved

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,200
into the mainstream

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,360
and more people get paid to do open

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,559
source then do it for free

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,480
this is changing and again ospo plus

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,880
plus the idea of that is to expand on

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,159
the idea of open source for public good

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:51,520
and actually make it work this time

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:53,440
so one of the big things that they're

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,840
having to re-learn

00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:58,640
as we talk about this network effect is

00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:00,400
the idea that all boats rise

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,159
why do all boats rise because that's how

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,960
open source works there are no

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,400
fences interestingly in the world of

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,360
open source we're seeing a lot of

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,559
emotional response in the newest crop of

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:12,880
of leaders

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,480
to um what they perceive first as a

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,120
sustainability effort but

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,000
um the fact that maintainers are tired

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,600
and you know

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,919
20 years of doing something will make

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,840
anybody tired

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,960
how to fix that problem looking at the

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,600
money trail

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,559
and then thinking oh my gosh we have to

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,679
write licenses

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,559
that that cause people through legal

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,520
means to

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,799
or moral means to contribute can measure

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,640
it with the value that they're

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,000
deriving from the thing that's being

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,880
written and maintained not

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,320
by their employees right so that's

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,840
selective boats

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,440
thinking um you know if you're

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,440
if you're doing it for free then you get

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,159
a pass but if you have money then you

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,279
need to

00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,799
you know give us some um we decided a

00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,600
long time ago that open source wouldn't

00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,840
work that way

00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,840
all the boats have to rise and how this

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:05,919
manifests in academia and

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:08,720
in municipalities is some of the boats

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,200
want to see some other boats not rise

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,880
like

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,480
every time i've ever spoken about open

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,360
source and a municipal government and

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,679
i've been doing this for 22 years now

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,720
they eventually ask me how they can lock

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,200
out their

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:24,080
competitor country to the north south

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,320
east or west that they don't trust

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,600
right um for whatever reason and we

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,039
always have to say that's not how it

00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,760
works

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,760
so this is a this is a big pill for you

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,640
to swallow if you've been competing for

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,039
resources

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,159
all of your life figuring out how to

00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:41,840
share

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,360
is harder right and get it letting even

00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,200
some of the poorer countries get the

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,320
benefit of the fact that you're paying

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,400
for stuff

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,400
now i worked on the coveted tracing app

00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,080
that is now called covet green app

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:55,120
over at linux foundation i worked for

00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,200
them on that for the irish government

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,159
we had a paying customer the irish

00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,480
government

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,960
i spent most of my time on that project

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,880
advocating for a broader vision

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,000
and for them to spend a little more

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,760
money to

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,840
build something that could be more

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,880
broadly used around the world for good

00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,559
reasons

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,919
and that has worked out but it's the

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,000
first time that the irish government's

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:19,279
ever actually engaged in that kind of

00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,760
altruism and they're altruistic people

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,640
but it's a hard thing to think of if you

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,440
have

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,720
accountants running a matrix of cost

00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,400
versus benefit

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,000
because it seems like an intangible

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,360
benefit so this is one of the biggest

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,559
challenges that i think

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,559
the ospos ospo plus plus network will

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,320
face but the point of making it a

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:42,320
network is finding

00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:44,720
articulation of intangible values

00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:46,960
faster and in a more compelling way so

00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,320
that people don't get stuck on the penny

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,080
counting

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,480
right so we who i referred to earlier is

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,159
a

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,799
little consortium of people we call

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,520
ourselves mosslabs.io

00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:02,400
and this background here is from the

00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:05,200
website mosslabs.io and it is uh

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,320
pointers to documentation about a series

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,120
of events or

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,559
things that moss labs has engaged in

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:14,400
over the last

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:16,880
um two years and what's interesting is

00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,240
during this time is exactly when europe

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,360
was analyzing

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,880
the idea of open source as applied to a

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,240
federal government

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,559
and how you would choose how to set that

00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,640
up

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,240
the obama administration was also deeply

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,919
into open source i didn't tell that

00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,799
story but i'm happy to and

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,240
somebody asks in in the questions this

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:37,679
is worth going to look at

00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,600
and it's definitely worth getting

00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,600
involved in if you represent

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,880
either academia or a municipal

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,120
government

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,600
there's a lot of opportunity to right

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,120
now a lot of interest from some very

00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,520
deep pockets but they're not

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,240
traditional deep pockets like we're

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,240
doing this

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,679
because we're a tech company and we want

00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,679
to get on this wave

00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,200
this is more like we have problems to

00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,279
solve and this looks like a better way

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,640
than the way we've been trying to do it

00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,480
but they need a lot of help to

00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,520
understand and they need a lot of help

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,440
to figure out

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,960
how to fit in within the boundaries of

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,360
what open source means without once

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,880
again

00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,960
trying to redefine it all right so that

00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,399
is the end of my talk i have 10 minutes

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,919
for questions i think

00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:20,799
um join me on friday if you thought this

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,880
was interesting

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,320
for a different talk lessons learned

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:26,399
from building inner source comments

00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,720
that's a really short 15-minute talk

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,600
but it's part of a block of inner source

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,880
stuff

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,039
and if you haven't looked at inner

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,320
source but you've had to try to explain

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,240
to a company

00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,480
how to do open source and it's been too

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,559
hard you want to see this because this

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:44,240
will help you understand how to apply

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:46,640
inner source methods inside first

00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,399
behind behind the firewall to get

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,120
everybody ready for the idea of how to

00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,960
collaborate

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,720
i think this is the most important

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,440
sustainability thing that we could be

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,320
doing

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,399
so i hope you'll join me for that and in

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:02,399
the meantime thank you very much

00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:05,440
and now i will turn my my slides off

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:07,840
hopefully so that we can go back to

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,840
talking

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,679
uh yeah thank you so much for that

00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:15,279
denise that was a great

00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:19,919
a really nice way to kick off the day um

00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:23,039
i have a question um from the audience

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,880
someone asks uh in your experience what

00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,000
is it that usually triggers an

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:30,080
organization to

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:33,120
take that first step and set up an ospo

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:36,640
usually in my experience it is still

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,480
concern from the legal community or the

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,240
policy community or the compliance

00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,399
community about

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,159
getting it wrong or the brand sometimes

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:47,039
the branding people

00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,640
um and that's not a bad impetus as long

00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:50,799
as they don't get stuck there

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,840
right you do need to understand what the

00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,120
working

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:57,200
tolerances are and and before you can

00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,880
do something innovative like the summer

00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,360
code right you need to figure out what

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,720
the

00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,000
what the rules are um but i wish that

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,000
people setting up oscillators would

00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,640
think more about it that way

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,399
like now that i understand the rules how

00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,200
far can i go in the direction i want to

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:14,799
go

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,640
rather than um you know going through

00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:22,000
years of slogging through the rules

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:24,240
and being pretty boring right

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,760
um okay um we have time for another

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,760
question so if anyone wants to

00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,279
write one um now's your chance

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,919
wait i must not have been controversial

00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,919
enough if that's

00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,240
i mean you have time you know you're

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,399
giving another couple of talks so

00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,919
i'm sure if people um want to ask you

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:44,960
questions they have time to

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,600
to do that as well yeah we get a lot of

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,600
questions

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,960
over at mosslabs about why we called it

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,799
plus plus

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:56,480
okay the first plus is about

00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:59,679
expanding it past code to data hardware

00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,159
all the open and plus is that network

00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,960
effect

00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,080
trying to get the cities to start

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,640
sharing information

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,080
instead of somehow seeing it as a

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,840
competitive advantage

00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,440
as those cities need to compete against

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:15,600
each other right

00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,600
i mean maybe they do but

00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,279
it's probably not to the to the

00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,480
advantage of their citizenry i would

00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:24,000
imagine

00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:26,399
yeah the idea here is some of the larger

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,279
municipalities like the city of paris

00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,039
are building

00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,480
open source tools that are actually

00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,880
pretty valuable

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,120
but everybody else isn't jumping on the

00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,519
bandwagon of learning how to use them

00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,640
now i know more about the situation in

00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,279
the u.s in terms of

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,679
sizes of things so i'll say that there

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,399
are

00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:46,240
something like 35 000 municipalities in

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,080
the us that are too small to have their

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,159
own programmers

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,360
so one of the things moss labs has been

00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,399
thinking about is

00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:57,519
how to increase

00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:59,039
their access with turnkey solutions but

00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,640
we have to work out you know who would

00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,760
run them who would manage them all that

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,360
stuff right

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:08,000
and um another another interesting thing

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,279
is uh the largest research institutions

00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,080
worldwide

00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:13,120
already share a fair amount but they

00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,600
also

00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,679
all have technology transfer offices

00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,960
that try to patent things

00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:22,240
um to to preserve value within that

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,600
university so that they can get

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,000
licensing fees

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,120
but it's not working and what it really

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,440
effectively does

00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,200
is people abandon whatever they work

00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,679
done for their phd project

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,519
and go invent it over in the technical

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,440
world you know commercial world

00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,960
because they can't access that

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,600
information that from what they did

00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,159
before

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,360
without any fee that they can't afford

00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,880
so

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:49,279
if you look at the really successful um

00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,679
hallmarks of the internet era you know

00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:53,919
you see things like the world wide web

00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,960
well tim berners-lee decided not to pay

00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:57,039
that idea so

00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,039
that it would grow it's like the

00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,279
ultimate in permissive licensing

00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:03,200
so what we're seeing now are really

00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,240
serious research institutions like johns

00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,320
hopkins

00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,399
setting up an osbo first of all johns

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,320
hopkins set up an ospo last year it's

00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:12,640
kind of amazing right

00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,679
they put it in the library because it's

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:17,360
the one place that everybody touches

00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,519
this year they're doing something called

00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:22,080
semesters of code

00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,519
semesters of code is an embroidery on

00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,320
summer of code

00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,600
it's the idea that you could for your

00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,440
own students

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,200
help them to the experience of working

00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,640
in this way and you'd get more of them

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,320
involved if you weren't

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,000
paying money you know getting through

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,360
the the hoops that you have to get

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,159
through in order to get on the gravy

00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,360
train of

00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:43,440
the google summer code what if you

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,679
a took projects that were being written

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:49,039
in your university anyway

00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:50,880
open source them b get your own students

00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:52,880
involved get them a fast track to

00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,720
getting involved in those projects

00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,320
and then c hopefully help them

00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,559
springboard from that experience

00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,159
into the commercial world in a way that

00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,919
connects to that experience

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,519
the first institution we know that did

00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,519
this exactly this

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,560
was university of california in santa

00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:12,000
cruz they have an amazing program

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,800
that is just this right they they had a

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,839
grad student

00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,839
who was already frankly a known

00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,520
quantity out in silicon valley but he

00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:21,760
came back to do a phd

00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,520
he took what he did and turned it into a

00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,079
company that kind of the project is

00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,040
called

00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:29,440
ceph he took what he did he turned it

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,440
into a company he made a lot of money

00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,879
the university got back to him and said

00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,480
hey you're an alumni and we helped you

00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,520
to this experience why don't you give us

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,919
some of your money

00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,679
and he said i would be happy to do that

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:42,320
if you made it possible for

00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,599
other students to do what i did so they

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,399
built a whole program

00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,800
just about reproducing that experience

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,359
right

00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,599
that is something that can be reproduced

00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:54,720
around the world of academia

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,839
and similarly again the city of paris

00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,560
for their own needs

00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:00,560
wrote a soup to nuts here's a package

00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,599
that runs a major city and it's paris

00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:05,680
it's a big city right

00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:06,880
217 separate services that every city

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,720
pretty much needs

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,480
i need a marriage license how do i go

00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,599
get one i have a pothole in my street

00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,680
how do i get that

00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,040
you know right and then very creative

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,960
ones like um

00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,400
they put a certain proportion of their

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,440
budget aside

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,680
uh or public commentary in

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,760
what they call participatory budgeting

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,560
right citizens realize that they

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,320
are the government how much would how

00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,160
much would that shift things if people

00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,599
got back to realizing that they are the

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,440
government instead of

00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:39,359
without the government endlessly and um

00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,880
helping municipalities to figure out how

00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,680
to do some of these things

00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,920
this all fits in the rubric of osbo plus

00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:59,839
plus that's why we got it

00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:59,839
okay great um thank you so much for that

00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,000
