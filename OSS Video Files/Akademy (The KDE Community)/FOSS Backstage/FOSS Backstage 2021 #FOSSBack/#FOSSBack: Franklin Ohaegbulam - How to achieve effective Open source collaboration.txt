Title: #FOSSBack: Franklin Ohaegbulam - How to achieve effective Open source collaboration
Publication date: 2021-03-01
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Open source collaboration requires open-mindedness and team players since every individual with varying personalities, work experience and attitude are involved. Creating an atmosphere that respects diversity increases engagement, encourages open communication and fosters accountability amongst every participant. People can collaborate better to open source project using the right collaboration and project management tools. Organizing meetings daily or weekly, asking questions, networking with coworkers, making suggestions, asking for feedbacks and guidance, sharing knowledge and assigning roles to everyone as a group or individually also ensures efficient collaboration. It is pertinent for everyone to communicate effectively and also respect peoples opinions in order to accomplish a successful open source collaboration. Four specific topics have been chosen for this talk in an effort to demonstrate the various ways of collaborating and managing open source projects. For each topic, unique tips are highlighted and principles of team management discussed.

and project management tool

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,400
principles of effective open source

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,880
collaboration

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,360
some of the principles of faces of

accountability the most

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,200
successful open source projects have

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,640
systems

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:58,079
and processes where participants

00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,479
can reference a project schedule and tax

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,320
so they have a clear understanding of

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,240
how their contributions

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,319
affect the group adaptability

obstacles or unforeseen issues that may

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,200
delay progress

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,160
adapting well to changes comes with

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,000
practice

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:24,959
and experience

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,760
clarity is natural for people to have

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,800
their own

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,000
priorities or interests that is why it's

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,760
important to

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,480
identify everyone's priority and agenda

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,360
up front to find a common denominator

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,879
that will move the project forward

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:46,160
efficiency to increase productivity

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:49,360
in person meetings or rather video calls

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,959
with agenda and clear goals outlined for

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,680
each participant

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,680
must be made

00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:02,840
empathy the more you get to know

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,319
your fellow participants or colleagues i

00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,800
understand

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,760
and understand how they work and what

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,400
challenges

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,920
they are dealing with the better chance

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,680
you will have are successfully

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,760
collaborating with them

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,280
having empathy for your teammates can

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,040
allow you to better understand their

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,080
motives

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,239
and feelings taking time to listen

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,319
and understand how others think and what

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,000
can help you to communicate with them

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:32,879
in the right ways optimism just because

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,920
you had a group project go paul in the

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,959
past

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,239
doesn't mean the same might happen try

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,760
to let go

00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:44,799
and start and

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,799
and approach every work like a new start

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,799
with an open mind and positive mindset

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,040
organization collaboration cannot be

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,040
successful

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,239
or less people are able to delegate

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,480
workload

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,280
take care of their responsibilities and

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,680
keep themselves organized

respect for diversity to ensure

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,879
effective collaboration

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,159
is essential to reflect on any implicit

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,000
biases

00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,599
or decisions that could be sought to

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,920
form of discrimination

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,919
when working with colleagues from other

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:22,240
countries and culture

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:25,600
trusts people need to feel safe

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,720
and receive genuine constructive

00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,280
feedback

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,560
be inspired by a common goal and have

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,600
the tools

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:37,360
and opportunities to connect

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:41,440
transparency practicing honesty

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:44,400
and transparency at work might

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,840
mean working through a disagreed working

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,000
trade disagreement

00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,919
explain that you are unable to complete

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,320
a certain tax on time

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,440
or sharing difficult updates without

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,840
transparency

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,360
it can be difficult for a team to

00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:02,639
develop trust

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,639
and therefore work together efficiently

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,720

and learn to compromise

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,320
to identify strengths and weaknesses of

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,199
team members

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,560

encourages team members to speak out and

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:04,880
interact with both colleagues and

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,319
and the project maintainers when working

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,280
closely with others

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,199
is essential you listen closely to each

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,319
team member's idea

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:18,000
feedback and advice and be considerate

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:20,240
and respectful when responding

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,240
while you may have your own ideas about

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,960
the direction of a project

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,840
or how the team should perform each tax

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,479
is critical

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,120
you take your colleague's opinion into

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,120
account too

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,880

weaknesses of team members

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,039
it is a great strategy to work with team

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,319
members strengths

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,800
rather than working around their

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,440
weaknesses this enables each

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,840
person to get to know themselves better

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,319
and their individual strengths

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,199
then pair them with convenient tags or

00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,680
rules

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,240
it will help save you significantly

00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,800

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,880
the confidence of the member and better

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,000
understand their personality

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,880
when teams are connected in this way

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,680
each mem each member is set up for

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,880
success

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,840
because they are each assigned tax that

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:21,520
play to their respective strengths

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:24,400
clarity of team goals and papers

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,440
to create a question team members must

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,639
be provided

00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,520
with a convincing reason to be a part of

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,560
the

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,840
companies to be a part of the project's

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,400
mission rather

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,919
to drive success and team members is

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,039
important to set

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,240
measurable goals for each on a quarterly

00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,160
basis

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,680
having a clear course on why to get

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,520
involved

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,240
makes them passionate about the goals

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,240
and objectives

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,400
for collaboration to work the vision and

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,120
peoples must be clear

00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,319
assign rules and responsibilities

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,520
members of the free

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,360
and open source software community

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,879
should understand their roles and

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,319
responsibilities

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:13,199
in a collaborative environment

00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:15,720
by that way they can review their rules

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,199
and encourage participants to take more

00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,120
responsibilities

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,120
and be ready to support support them as

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,960
well

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,240
within the dynamics of teamwork it's

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,199
important that the parties

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,720
involve but understand the work they are

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,440
responsible for

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,320
and make the efforts to complete the

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,120

create an atmosphere of trust

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,200
a balanced and sustained collaboration

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,399
system listening to team members

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,160
feedback

00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,160
and involve them in decision making

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,880
process as a team leader

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,080
is mostly up to you to create a safe

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,040
environment

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,560
based on trust setting up visible and

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,120
realistic goals

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,200
is a good way to start ensuring that you

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:07,120
are able to manage performance

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:10,880
in a way that motivates the
