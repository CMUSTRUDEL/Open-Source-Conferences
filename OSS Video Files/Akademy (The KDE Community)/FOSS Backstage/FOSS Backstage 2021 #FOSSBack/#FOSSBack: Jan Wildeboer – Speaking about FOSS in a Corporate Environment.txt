my name is

00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,200
jan wildebore i work at uh red hat as

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,480
emi

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,160
evangelist since uh 15 years now and i

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,520
just wanted to give you

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,199
uh or share my my sort of elevator pitch

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,199
if you want to

00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,279
position free and open source software

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,720
in any corporate environment or also in

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,560
public environments it doesn't really

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,080
matter when people ask the question

00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,279
you know why should we care about this

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,320
and if specifically if you want to

00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,880
um encourage them to allow people to

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,640
share

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,480
with other people because that's always

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,239
the point a lot of companies say like oh

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,440
my god corporate secrets we have to be

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,640
very careful

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:48,079
so my shortest version is

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,680
effectively this um when you think about

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,840
the world we live in today

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,760
then a few things have changed compared

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,600
to maybe 20 years ago

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,039
the biggest change that we are

00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,960
experiencing is

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,480
that hardware has become more or less

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,879
irrelevant and everything

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,239
everything now more or less happens on

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,720
the software layer

00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,960
and when you work on the software layer

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,240
you know you need to have this kind of

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,320
of abstraction

00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,560
to even think about stuff like cloud or

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,159
devops or all of this stuff so

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,840
the software layer defines everything

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,920
nowadays software defined networking

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,280
software defined storage etc and when

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,159
you look at

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,280
a typical it stack in this modern world

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,720
which is you know

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,079
this size this is your i.t stack

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,680
then this is where things get

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,880
interesting and this is what i always

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,840
point out

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,360
if you are a company and you know you're

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,680
in a market and you're competing with

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,720
other companies then

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,439
this it stack in your vertical typically

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,119
tends to be

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,119
quite comparable to your direct

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,360
competition because you work on the same

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,200
laws the same regulations

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,799
so you tend to have a lot of parts

00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,560
working in the same way

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,479
and if you take a closer look and this

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,719
is what always you know gives

00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,840
people this this surprise moment when we

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,600
take a closer look

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,920
then we see that maybe you know 10 20

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,040
on top of this whole stack is stuff

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,599
where you actually make

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,280
money that is your secret sauce that is

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:12,879
the stuff that sets you apart from the

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,640
rest the stuff that you need to hide and

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,840
keep secret

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,760
but that means logically very simply

00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:24,879
that 80 of this functionality

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,080
in your mostly software-driven it stack

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,319
actually is non-competitive

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,440
functionality it is stuff that

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,920
does not add to your margin it's just

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,040
stuff

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,000
that you need in the broader sense and

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,519
that is exactly

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,480
where open source and free software

00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:43,519
kicks in because we built that 80

00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,760
so that you can focus on that 20

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,879
from a company organization perspective

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,360
this also means

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,840
should i really focus all my money on

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,959
the 100 of that stack when in reality

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,720
it's only the 20

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,959
that i really should care about and

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,519
doesn't it make far more sense to reach

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,640
out

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,720
to your direct competition even to work

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,560
together on that 80 percent because if i

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,120
can get four companies to work together

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,680
on

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,680
whatever part in that eighty percent our

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,200
respective investment risk just dropped

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,480
by 75 percent

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,080
because we are now sharing this stuff

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,840
and it's non-competitive so we're not

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,840
giving anything away

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,120
with this argument with this 80 20

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,040
distribution of

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,800
looking at stacks it's a very general

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,200
principle it's a pareto principle and

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,120
you know it's it's it's nothing special

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,879
but it helps in positioning what open

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,519
source really means in i.t

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,000
it's not necessarily the fancy cool

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,400
whatever

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,319
stuff because that's not what open

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,400
source works on open source works on the

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,720
stuff that everybody needs ideally

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,599
that can be shared freely as freely as

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,239
possible

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,239
and that adds to that eighty percent

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,599
that we all need to build working stacks

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,000
now you can call this

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,640
openstack you can call this kubernetes

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,280
or whatever

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,400
ultimately all of these projects are

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,040
working on the same thing

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,200
standardize the hell out of the lower

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,120
eighty percent and work together on that

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,760
in a non-competitive way

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,400
i guess i'm almost perfectly on time i

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,000
still have

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,480
50 min 50 seconds left so with that

00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,080
think about this as a way to position

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,519
what we are doing in the world of open

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,760
source and free software

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,280
how this explains a lot of things in a

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,120
very simple way that makes it

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,359
understandable to people who are not

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,960
really deep into this if you have any

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:24,240
questions you can meet me later on in

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:29,840
the spatial lounge

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,840
or you can ask them right here thank you

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,120
