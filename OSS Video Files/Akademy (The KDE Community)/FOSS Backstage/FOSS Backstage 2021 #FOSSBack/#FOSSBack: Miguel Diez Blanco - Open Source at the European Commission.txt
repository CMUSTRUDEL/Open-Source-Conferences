	00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,120
my name is

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,639
miguel diaz i i work at a digit in the

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,200
european commission

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,280
which is basically for the ones who know

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,600
his european commission is organizing

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,920
different directorates and i work in the

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,240
one which is responsible for informatics

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,400
the

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,279
digit digit and um yeah what i plan to

00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,840
do in the next

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,480
minutes is just to give you an overview

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,840
of first the open source strategy

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,800
which was released in october

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,320
last year and then i will explain some

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,200
of the things we are doing right now

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,640
related to

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:45,039
to open source so

00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,200
regarding the this strategy as i said

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,559
before is public you can check it out if

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,760
you want and there is the link

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:55,199
afterwards in the final slide um

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:58,320
it was released in october last year and

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:01,039
is not in fact the first strategy that

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,640
we released it was it's in fact the

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:08,159
fifth iteration of previous ones

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,799
that initially they were local let's say

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,240
to our directorate in digit

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,840
since we were in contact with open

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,000
source in year 2000 we have been

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,799
producing different strategies

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:24,080
uh that were evolving with our expertise

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,920
um and as until last year when we did

00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,759
this final one which is different than

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,600
the previous ones because

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,920
the previous one as i said it was for us

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:36,159
it was a document just for dg digit to

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,400
to organize ourselves to to have our own

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,640
strategy but this one

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,399
it's a strategy that involves the whole

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,240
commission so

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,479
with this strategy the whole commission

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,439
is adopting a position towards open

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,320
source

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:52,479
that was not formalized before and uh

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,560
which is a big change

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,560
and we like to apply this this this

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,159
motor thing open because that's what we

00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,880
are trying to

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,479
to achieve it's to change the culture

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,040
within commission

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,040
which in fact was already happening uh

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,920
we will get into details later

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,720
but to have it in this formalized

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,280
strategy involving the entire commission

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,280
is is a huge step for us and we are very

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,560
proud of it

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,879
the strategy comes with an action plan

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,560
is

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,160
is 10 actions i will not go

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,840
through all of them because that will

00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,160
take a lot of time but i will

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,360
i will focus on the ones that i believe

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,560
are more relevant

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,599
and the ones we are working on right now

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,080
and the first one and this is something

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,680
we see

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,440
happening more and more often in the

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,280
public environment is the creation of an

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,760
open source program office

00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,239
probably in the private environment that

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,800
was happening already a few years ago

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,280
but um in the public environment that

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,840
was

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,560
not happening as often we see now that

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,280
more and more

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,840
different organizations they are having

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,040
this

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,280
um body uh

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,080
within the organization and in our case

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,800
yes we

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,440
that's the first action we did it uh

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,640
together with the strategy in october

00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,360
and for an ospo

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,480
there are different definitions but in

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,959
our case

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,519
our mission what we try to do at least

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,120
in this

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:26,400
first stage is first of all to promote

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,640
open source practices within commission

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,159
uh provide support and guidance to the

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,680
open source projects

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,760
and as well to those projects that want

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,239
to become open source

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,200
we represent as well commission in open

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,480
source events

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,120
like like this one and um

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,440
we we try to do networking also we are

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,120
in contact with other ospos

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,519
and finally of course this action plan

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,519
that i mentioned before we are the

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:57,200
responsibles to make sure

00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:01,760
it's it's happening so um

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:04,720
now thinking more about this action plan

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:06,239
uh i will explain some of them um i

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,040
explained the declaration of the us

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,840
already the

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,720
action number two is what we call inner

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,319
source

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,799
as default so applying open source

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,239
within within commission and we like

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,959
this picture because it's

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,160
basically about breaking silos it's

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,800
about

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,280
sharing the code that we do making it

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,080
open

00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,680
accessible to to other teams so that

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,880
they can benefit from the code that we

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,600
produce

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,320
um you have to know that commission is

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,680
very big

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,120
we are more than 30 000 staff members

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,320
and that's without

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,080
considering the the consultants and

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,600
in every digit we produce a lot of

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,320
applications we produce

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,680
a lot of code we were checking in our

00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,720
git repository

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,840
a couple of weeks ago and we had at

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,080
least more than 1

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,199
500 projects i.t projects maybe it's

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,320
even more

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,880
and we learned that not all of them are

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,400
open

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,919
not not all of them the code is

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,600
accessible to the other teams

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:11,440
in fact um when we checked we

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,000
only could see 10 of these 1500 projects

00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,840
which means that we have a lot of code

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,440
we have a lot of software that is not

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,240
being seen by all the teams and this is

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,039
a pity

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,520
we cannot capitalize on the things we do

00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:26,080
we might be doing things twice

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,240
we cannot contribute and that's not good

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,639
for the organization so

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,320
what we are trying to do now in our git

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,680
repository is to make sure that for

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,800
every new project

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:39,120
when you start with an um with yeah

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,360
developing code by default your code

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,520
will be visible to the other teams

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,600
and we do not expect that by that people

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,759
are going to start doing pull requests

00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,720
all of a sudden but at least it's the

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,199
first step

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,400
to make this switch that i was

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,039
mentioning before

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,319
this thing open that we want and about

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,280
sharing

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,400
so that's uh an interesting action

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,520
action three

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,000
um if before i was talking about inner

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,160
source

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,440
so working or adopting open source

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,880
internally

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:17,280
this is more about our presence outside

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:19,600
outside commission we do have

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,759
currently projects that are open source

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,639
that are available in github

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,680
but they are isolated cases and we do

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,800
not have

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,440
an official european commission account

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,199
where we as a blog we are present in

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,759
gitlab in github

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,000
and we see that other governmental

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,199
organizations like nasa

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,240
or the european space agency they are

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,080
already there and

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,240
we should be there as well we should

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,240
have our own presence in github

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,840
and have contributions from the open

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:53,120
source communities

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,199
uh in a structured way so as part of

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,520
this action the us boys in contact with

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,520
the

00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,800
technical teams in charge of our git

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,160
repositories

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,599
to make sure that we go out there with

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,599
our open source projects

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:09,360
in a official and organized way so

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,599
that's something we are working on as

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,599
well

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,599
then uh action four um

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,680
this is about changing the way we

00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,319
distribute our software

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,680
what you see in this screen is something

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,400
that we call

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,039
a commission decision it's a document

00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,720
that

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,639
development teams in commission they

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,400
have to produce if they want to go

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:36,319
open source they have to draft a cover

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:39,759
node they have to

00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:42,720
uh to to to write this document

00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,560
then they have to have it approved then

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,800
there is an inter-service consultation

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,479
and if everything if everything is fine

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,039
and if everybody agrees

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,960
then this development team they can go

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:56,319
outside they can put their code

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,000
outside as open source as you can see

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,039
it's a heavy process and

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,840
when we see that development teams they

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,759
have to do that

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:07,840
in order to get their their code as open

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,440
we see that this is very discouraging

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,960
and so

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,120
the ospo we are working with um

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,479
other teams in commission to change that

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,639
process and that

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,639
instead of having to do all these

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,479
administrative paperwork

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,039
if a development team they want to go

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,960
open source and put their code in github

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,080
by default they can do it there is no

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,720
necessary

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,680
it's not necessary to do this paperwork

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,800
and

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,120
we hope that by that teams they are

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,959
a bit they feel relieved and they can go

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,279
easily to put their code because we know

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,640
that

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:45,519
we have this willingness to do that but

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,519
these administrative steps we know that

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,760
they are

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,240
discouraging certain teams to do so so

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:55,519
we hope that by changing these rules

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,760
we will invite our teams to more and

00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:01,279
more contribute to putter code

00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:04,560
in the different git repositories and

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,560
being part of the community

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,120
now another action we call it the open

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,880
source

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,800
innovation labs this is something else

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:16,480
we are working on

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:19,279
it's about setting up a control

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,000
environment and protected where we can

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,440
test

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,560
open source products with the aim of

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,120
uh finally adopting them in our app

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,800
story

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,279
in our set of tools that we use every

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,320
day and

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,560
we before christmas we were asking all

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,200
the different dgs in commission

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,720
okay we are launching this um do you

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,399
have any ideas what products would you

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,600
like to test

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,920
and it was very surprising to see uh

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,000
the amount of responses that we got of

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,560
people proposing ideas

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,240
open source products that go from

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,320
artificial intelligence to

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,160
desktop solutions please test this this

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,120
is a good thing please

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,440
and we were very pleased to have this

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,079
amount now we have a nice problem which

00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,600
is to decide

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,920
what we do first but getting back again

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,320
to

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,079
did what i was saying that commission is

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,480
already changing the mood

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,000
that's already a good sign that the

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,160
strategy that we are coming

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,839
it's good it's a way to officialize but

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,200
we already noticed

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,959
that there is a trend already in

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,200
commission to

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,959
yeah to look more into open source and

00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,480
adopt open source practices

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,360
so we hope that with this innovation

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,920
labs we do interesting discoveries

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,640
and yeah eventually that they fulfill

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,839
cases

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,839
where we need these products

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:45,040
okay next action this is about

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,079
outreach the community so getting closer

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,360
to

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:52,480
open source communities i have

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,240
divided it into four sub-actions

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,959
and this is something we are doing as

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,600
part of the isa square program

00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,040
maybe some of you know isa squared is a

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,640
program

00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,360
that is running for many years that

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:08,480
tends to promote interoperability

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,760
and reusability across across the eu

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,240
in public services and with these funds

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,279
that we

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,320
have received with ice square we are

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,519
doing these

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,160
four sub-actions and the first one that

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:25,680
we are doing is launching a study

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,200
about the funding mechanisms existing in

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,640
europe

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,920
of course we know that they are open

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:35,200
source funds like the apache foundation

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,000
linux foundation but we want to know

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,560
whether there are

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,920
still open source communities that die

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,760
they are not being

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:45,600
helped enough despite having these

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,519
funds available we want to know what is

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,079
out there we want to know

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,480
if there are any gaps if there are any

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:55,600
communities that they need extra help

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,160
financially or maybe not financially but

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,000
just

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,839
support communication security

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,399
and we would like to have this picture

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,600
of how well served is the open source

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,320
community

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,360
in terms of funding because who knows

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,440
maybe

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,279
we once we see this study and we see

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,120
these gaps we can say hey

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,480
maybe commission they can do something

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,120
maybe there is a

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,600
particular area where we could have i

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,839
don't know

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,519
um european open source fund that maybe

00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,440
could tackle those cases that currently

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,639
are missed that

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,440
and um we see we are very interesting to

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,639
know what

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:38,399
uh this study will uh will tell us

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,639
and eventually what we want is to avoid

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,639
things like what you see in the picture

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,600
in this image where

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,279
it reminds me about the heartbleed

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,440
attack that happened a few years ago

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,560
where you have the entire internet

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,320
using the openssl library who knows how

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,279
many people were behind that library

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,200
maybe

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,639
if that component would have been better

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,399
supported

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,079
maybe we wouldn't have had the losses

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,720
the millions of years of losses that we

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,519
had

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,279
so we are really interested to know what

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,440
this study is giving us and whether we

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:12,720
can help once we know

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,720
how the landscape looks like

00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,200
still with the ice square program what

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,560
we are doing

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:24,000
the second sub initiative it's um

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,519
european of open source inventory

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,120
and maybe inventory is a big word

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,839
because of course we don't think we are

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,160
going to cover

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,600
all the public institutions in europe

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,399
but we want to know

00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,959
across europe across the eu from all the

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,200
different

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,959
public administrations which open source

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,600
products they are using

00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,040
with the ultimate goal of knowing which

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,040
are the most

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,399
critical ones the ones that are more

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,199
heavily used

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,600
and eventually see whether we can as

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,079
well

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,079
help those products maybe running back

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,120
bounties to make them more secure

00:13:54,079 --> 00:14:00,160
or maybe with some funding um

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,000
the idea is again to sustain

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,920
sustain these products that they are

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,240
giving already a service

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,160
and and see whether eventually

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,839
commission could help

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,440
so we are running this study

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,160
with an external firm they are helping

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,000
us they are serving the different public

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,560
administrations in europe at different

00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,399
levels

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,839
we they are talking to cities they are

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,519
talking to regions

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,240
to national governments and they asking

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,040
them okay which open source tools are

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,680
you using

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,839
and what is the criticality how often do

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,040
you use them for what purposes

00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:38,399
and um yeah we're looking forward to see

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:41,600
what it comes out of it and i

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,360
i take the opportunity for the attendees

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,600
the people listening to this that

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,880
if you are working for a european

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,160
institution

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,160
and you would like to be part of this

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,000
study please get in touch with

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,680
with us at the end of the slide you will

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,680
see our contact details

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,959
if you think that this institution is

00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,600
using open source and you would like

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:02,880
this open source to be in our inventory

00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,399
for potential improvements help that we

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:08,480
could give please

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:11,519
get in touch with with us so

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:15,440
moving on i'm now sorry

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:18,399
going to the third sub-action of

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,320
of this action number seven we are

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:24,639
running also back bounties currently

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:26,800
we are we before christmas we talked to

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,880
certain public institutions and we ask

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,040
them okay which are the products

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:34,720
that you are using open source that you

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,880
think would benefit from a back bounty

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,560
and we came up with these three moodle

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,480
element and simbra

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,160
and we are currently they are the three

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,959
of them they are going through a back

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,680
bounty

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:47,120
process there is an army of ethical

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,880
hackers going through them

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,399
and raising vulnerabilities is going

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,199
very well we are very

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,800
happy with the way it's going and we

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,279
hope that with this initiative we are

00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,480
helping

00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:01,360
these three solutions to become better

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,959
to become more secure and and to give at

00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,920
the end this ultimate service that we

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:08,320
give to

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:11,440
europe european public services

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:15,839
and uh the last sub-action

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:18,480
of of this action seven is

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,759
hackathons this is something we already

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,079
did in the past

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,720
with a project that some of you might

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:27,600
know it was called fosa2

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,720
it was very successful we were doing

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,720
back bounties as well

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,399
at that time and we were doing

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,600
hackathons of course they were

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,000
physical hackathons at that time now it

00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,800
will

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,480
be virtual but yes that's uh we are

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,639
planning to do two of them during the

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,160
first half of 2021.

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:48,079
we have a pretty clear ideas of we want

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,199
what we want to do it will be published

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:53,199
soon

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:54,240
and again the aim of this action seven

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,079
as the

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,399
as the other three set actions before is

00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,560
just to get again in contact with

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,000
open source communities bring them

00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,440
together share knowledge share

00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,880
experiences

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:10,000
and overall yeah help the

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:13,760
the the community so

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,319
this action seven was a bit longer and

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,679
we do have more as you saw in the action

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:21,600
plan

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:23,919
we had 10 actions some of them involve

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,640
our governance procedures like consider

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:28,799
open source when we evaluate projects

00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,919
others it's about a communication plan

00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,799
that we are doing

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,320
inside commission to promote open source

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,600
uh we are also working on

00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:40,480
trainings uh for uh our staff

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,600
to get more acquainted to open source we

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,919
are

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,720
also in the hr part we at some point we

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,679
will get

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,440
at the recruiting profiles to to see

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,799
whether we can include also the open

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,039
source

00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,720
dimension when we are for selection

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:59,039
criteria

00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:01,280
so as you can see we are very busy and

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,480
we are very exciting anyway we are very

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,880
happy

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,000
and at the end as i said the ultimate

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,120
goal is to

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,160
change the mentality of commission

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,160
i forgot to say that it's something that

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,360
it's an internal strategy it's something

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,320
that we do

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,520
for the organization um i say that

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,120
because at the beginning when the

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,880
strategy was released

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,480
some people said thought okay you are

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,080
doing something for the eu you are

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,640
promoting something

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,520
and no for the moment it's just a

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,640
strategy for

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,919
us uh for the organization to change our

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,600
culture

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:40,559
and to embrace ultimately uh open source

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,200
both in terms of practices mentality and

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:45,440
as well as

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:49,440
as tools so

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:52,559
uh that's all i wanted to to talk about

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,400
in case you have questions

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:58,160

and if you are interested in the

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:05,520
strategy you you have the link

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,360
as well over there so

00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,360
well thank you very much for your time i

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,039
hope i gave you a nice overview of what

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,799
we are doing

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,440
and if you have questions please feel

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:18,799

thank you very much for your time

00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:26,240
that was awesome thank you um

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,559
questions should be coming in soon

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,919
hopefully there's been no questions yet

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,760
but i think that's maybe because people

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,360
are writing them uh personally i think

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,640
that's awesome i really appreciated the

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,240
work that you're doing i think that's a

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,080
really great inner strategy

00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,360
session i have a couple of questions uh

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,400
while we're waiting for people to send

00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,440
them in

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,039
okay my first question is innovation lab

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,160
sounds awesome that seems really cool

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,360
that you're testing these things and

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,880
trying to see you know what's good and

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:52,000
what can be used by the ec

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,760
is there any plans to release the output

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,080
of the innovations labs of how that

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:59,039
testing process went

00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:01,200
well actually new was not initially

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,600
planned to release it uh because

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:06,159
we thought indeed in in terms of

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:09,360
internal strategy so uh

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:12,159
it was not the initial idea but

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,760
uh i think we will see if uh something

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,320
we didn't check maybe there's no problem

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,200
in

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,039
in sharing uh what we are using in fact

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,000
there's no secret to say that we already

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,280
have in our app store

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,840
things like libreoffice like firefox

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,320
so i think it should not be an issue to

00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:32,000
say afterwards look we are adding

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,360
uh element or moodle or yeah so

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,840
in theory i don't think it should be an

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,840
issue

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:41,520
excellent um i love that okay first

00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,919
question in the question tab

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,760
uh when you allow going open source as

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:47,200
default and got rid of the process

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,200
how do you ensure that the projects

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,880
confirm uh conform with licenses and

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,280
export laws

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,280
to the developers that's a good question

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:59,280
because i i forget to say that

00:20:55,280 --> 00:21:01,440
that indeed we are removing these legal

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,760
this administrative steps but there is a

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,880
step that will stay there which is this

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,760
uh out intellectual property checks that

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,039
uh

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,480
the joint research center is doing so we

00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,080
are helping the development teams they

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,039
will not have to do that paperwork

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,919
that's good

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,600
but we will not uh we will continue

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,200
doing of course the intellectual

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,799
property checks so that will stay

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,320
continuing as a control

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:27,360
but at least the development teams they

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:31,919
will not have to write those

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:33,440
allow me to say boring documents yeah

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,600
thank you for doing that work on behalf

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,559
of all developers everywhere

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,240
so still waiting for another question um

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:44,080
i have more questions

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:46,080
you mentioned bringing some stuff

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,080
internally and mentioned trying to give

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,000
back by maybe opening up a

00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,760
european commission fund i love that

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,520
idea that's awesome

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:55,440
what are you doing to help make sure

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,640
that people on european commission time

00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,159
are actually able to collaborate

00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,400
effectively with projects that aren't

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,240
under the european commission banner

00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,240
yeah that's something we have asked

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,760
ourselves and it's a tricky

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,799
it's a tricky point that we have not

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:11,520
find the answer yet because

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,320
we are a public institution okay so we

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,600
we use

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:17,840
taxpayers money and that translates into

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,440
projects with a limited budget you have

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,760
a project manager in commission i have

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,640
my budget i need to deliver

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,440
so when you will have a developer saying

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,159
look i want

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,840
friday this afternoon to contribute to

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,080
other projects

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,120
the manager will say okay how do we do

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,679
this because i

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,799
i need to justify your time we are using

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,000
public money

00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:43,280
so who knows maybe it's uh

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,280
maybe we have a clause that says

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,960
if it's something incidentally an

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,240
incidental contribution that's allowed

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,919
you don't even need to check to your

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,640
line manager

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,240
we're still working on that but um it's

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,520
a good point because we we

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,159
ourselves we are trying to find the

00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,960
answer to that

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,400
excellent um still waiting for more

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,600
questions it looks like it's just me

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,640
being able to ask all the questions i

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,480
want to ask which is

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,320
kind of fun um still five minutes left

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,960
that anyone is curious you mentioned at

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,120
the beginning

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,640
ospos what are you doing to make sure

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,960
you collaborate with other ospos or

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,960
osborne organizations

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:21,600
yeah well we attend to international

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,360
events open source events but also with

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,799
open forum europe we are in contact with

00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,960
them and they put us

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,559
in contact with other hospitals which is

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,679
very interesting we learned a lot from

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,720
from them

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,240
um like the ospo in the ministry of

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,760
technology in israel it's they are very

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,919
advanced and it's very amazing to see

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,000
what they are doing

00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,880
vice versa united nations they are

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:45,840
looking at us because

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,240
they want to know what we have done so

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,000
it's

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:52,080
uh basically yes we are keeping this um

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,240
this network thanks to being involved

00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,080
with other organizations

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,600
but now we are planning also to start

00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,720
leading ourselves

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,520
uh workshops with that we can organize

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,600
ourselves

00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:05,440
and we will start being active as well

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,360
and proactive and contacting

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,480
different organizations and to establish

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,520
some

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,240
regular uh meetings as well to catch up

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,840
and to share knowledge

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,679
i'm excited about that too i want to get

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,360
involved somehow um although i'm not

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,799
european so maybe i can't

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,240
which actually reminds me of my next

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,840
question because again still waiting for

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,880
more questions if anyone has any

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,919
please feel free um

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,200
i know there's some european

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,559
commissioners not all of them but

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,400
there's definitely a movement

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,400
of digital sovereignty the idea that

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,760
code in the eu should stay in the eu

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,120
um how is this

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,279
internal plan deal with that sort of

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,279
thing

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,960
uh well it's it's linked this obvious

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,000
link

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,600
uh things uh as you said uh digital

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,360
sovereignty is one of the

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,799
objectives and it was mentioned by

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,520
vanderlaan several times

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,880
in her speeches so an open source we see

00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,240
that as an enabler to that

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:03,919
so uh and um we

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:07,520
we basically uh and even in fact

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:10,159
now uh uh when we are asked for uh

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,440
uh open source products in in the case

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,440
of the innovation lab some of them they

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,279
were asking for a secure email solution

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:18,400
because they don't want to use

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:21,360
um another

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,039
another product so uh so yes it's very

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,559
interesting we think we consider that as

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:28,320
an enabler and that

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:31,440
of course is in our let's say

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,720
uh things to keep in mind when uh

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:37,760
having our role in in the osbo excellent

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,960
um good answer so uh

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,159
i have a question here um if paris gives

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,000
two hours

00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,480
to your code can you give two hours to

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,559
paris can we create a time exchange

00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,000
good idea that's uh so you meet the city

00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,760
of paris uh

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,440
assumingly it's probably philippa ray

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,159
but i'm not sure

00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,840
but that's that why not that that could

00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,640
be a kind of arrangement that we could

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,640
do between

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,880
institutions to to have like envelopes

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:06,080
of hours that we could exchange

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,000
to to contribute to um yeah two

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:25,840
different projects why not that would be

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:25,840
that would be an interesting exchange

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,720
