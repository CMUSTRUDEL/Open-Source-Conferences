Title: #FOSSBack: Thomas Fricke - Digital Sovereignty Driving Open Source in Germany and Europe
Publication date: 2021-02-23
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Since mid 2019 Digital Sovereignty has been promoted by the Government in Germany, for the most of us unexpectedly. 

Behind the scenes economical motivations are driving the initiatives. Several new governmental agencies have been created, projects have been started on scale driving the administration to go digital, finally deliver a promise broken for at least twenty years.

The fear of loosing the industrial technology base to the US and Chinese cloud hyperscalers, conflicts with the US administration on political questions have created lots of activities.

Gaia-X and the Corona app are only the most prominent initiatives started directly by the German government. 

The talk tries to give an overview what is going on, tries to give an estimation what will come next, how sustainable the initiatives are, where it makes sense to demand further steps.

	00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,960
let's

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,160
go to it the content is a little bit i

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,639
will talk about

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:14,400
this and i will start with the history

00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,600
and the economy and then

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,600
digital sovereignty example is gaia x

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,640
and there are a lot of other initiatives

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,119
which are worth mentioning at the moment

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,279
a disclaimer is a little bit long so i

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,599
will not read everything so i am

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,199
not working in the public sector i'm

00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,559
just doing everything there

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,520
for free at any moment i make my

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,440
money with combinations and especially

00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,480
securities so this is

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,960
enough to do a little bit of

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,719
free work in the public sector because

00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,160
it needs it

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,800
into that direction and i will

00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,320
[Music]

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,600
explain what i'm doing in the moment

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,320
or when it's important so a little bit

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,920
of history

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,720
um i was part of the team in 2001

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,760
which promoted zusa in the deutsche

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,960
bundestag we had

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,680
partial success and what we had to learn

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,080
the hard way is that there is a lot of

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,080
they are not interested in technology

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,720
at least at this time nobody was

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,799
interested zeus was

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,560
known as a nuremberg company and not

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,640
even the

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,920
member of parliament of that arya and of

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,119
the party have been

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,759
any interest for forza and um

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,960
we had a partial success means ibm made

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,320
some money those are

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:41,840
uh made the news or the headlines and

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,840
then uh finally we

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,479
received the notice that it has been

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:50,079
stopped by a hard

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,280
lobbyist who is a member of the atlantic

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,000
bridge

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,799
lobbying the council defense industry so

00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,399
we

00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:02,079
never never before i've met people

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:04,399
with such destructive power

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,759
and outside the public sector uh open

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,840
source

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,959
developed quite well from the very early

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,160
beginnings when

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:14,000
uh kyle's computer club in 1981

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,080
has been funded everything was there but

00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,599
they did not coin

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,640
it or frame it as a digital solidity but

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,959
if you read the

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,800
the manifests it's very close to this we

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,160
had a lot of conferences here partially

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,640
organized by

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,200
uh the team or the predecessor of the

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,040
team

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,959
which is giving the conference here we

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,080
had the linux star

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,959
chemists in brussels the first time and

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,239
in

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:47,360
2002 2006 and then amazon started to

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:50,480
become big and wanted to have this

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,480
um cloud like business and they adapted

00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,400
linux because it was all cheaper so one

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,879
of the first

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,680
really huge commercial adoptions was

00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:01,040
quite

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,000
nearly 20 years ago today we have a lot

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,120
of

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,800
organizations available and

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,480
as you might have noticed all the

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,640
startups in berlin are the

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,239
not anymore startups like zellando

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,720
immorbilian scout all the

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,840
idiot all the bigger things i cannot

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,680
name them all

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,480
are using open source software kind of

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,280
they are promoting open source they have

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,400
an

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:30,239
inner source program and it's

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,360
it's working quite well if we talk about

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,879
economy

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,879
we have to know the standard patterns so

00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:40,319
that's a

00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:42,480
making money capital accumulation and

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,440
general pattern is to privatize the

00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,159
profits and socialize the losses so

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,720
this is one of these common patterns

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,280
which we

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,640
really don't like but it's you will face

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,400
it everywhere

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,760
and you have a politics of interest

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,000
which is not even

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,239
uh easy to explain in english because

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,560
politics of interest is always

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,000
economically framed in english so it's

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,920
kind of lobbyism

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,680
you have a lot of psychological

00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,799
psychology greed

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,599
thought and all the other things

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,400
and everything important it's all

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,479
sometimes it's important to

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,320
know what is not mentioned so this is

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,400
called the reader deconstruction i

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,680
will present the slides with all the

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,840
links in it

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,160
and we will see what this means in a few

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,960
minutes

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:32,400
does money make open source go around

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,360
here is a list

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,360
of the last acquisitions in the open

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,600
source business so public

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,560
um open source companies have been

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,000
bought by other

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:47,280
biggest one is red hat bought by ibm

00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,320
34 billion zuzer is rumored

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,520
that it will have an ipo this year about

00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,560
6 billion

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,440
docker failed to get acquired by

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,560
microsoft

00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,320
because they didn't want it

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,320
rancher has been acquired by zuza and so

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,560
on we have we have hundreds of millions

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,120
of acquisitions in open source so it

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,479
looks like it is a big business but on

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,280
the other side if you look

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,320
what which companies had the most profit

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,440
of open source

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,080
apple was a bsd kernel microsoft which

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,960
is

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,440
using uh canonical our ubuntu software

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,199
in

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:26,400
in its cloud amazon and google they are

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,360
uh thousands of millions so in german we

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,759
have this

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,479
billion american it's trillion so don't

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,560
mix it

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,520
and if we compare to the next bigger

00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,960
companies like

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:40,800
tesla sap or in germany

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,639
they are factor of 10 or

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,400
compared to the open source companies

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,720
factor 50

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,080
bigger than the open source company so

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,000
open source

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,680
a billion in open source looks big but

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,880
compared to the big platforms or the

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,560
hyperscalers

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:59,440
is not a huge number one site remark

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,039
uh germany always is proud of having

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,160
found the ip

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:07,360
the mp3 standard but if you compare the

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,479
money they uh earned by patents

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,720
and compared to the value of spotify so

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:16,720
the platform versus uh

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:20,000
um whether it's a patent uh business

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,000
it's a factor of system

00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,240
[Music]

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,919
and they're considered as large

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,160
companies but uh

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,680
compared to the hyperscalers they're

00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,440
really small

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,360
and if you compare to the money which

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,280
has been

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,720
owed by private households in germany

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,960
this is

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:45,680
now even bigger it's nearly 7

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,960
billion or trillion for the americans

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,680
money so it's a

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,520
a huge number so what um it doesn't look

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,720
like that that money is a problem but we

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,720
have another problem here

00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,560
uh which is the investment is not really

00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,759
working well so we had we are in the

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,160
middle of the pandemic and even the most

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,120
prominent companies kurovac and biontech

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,639
which are

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:14,080
now big pharma business

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,560
they had difficulties to get money for

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,080
for their business so they need to ask

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,039
the government

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,000
for investment and not the vc market so

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,840
the vc market

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,680
in europe is completely defined so all

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,960
the companies which are successful are

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,000
bought by other

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:35,840
american funds and this is

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,120
a big problem here that we cannot really

00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,840
um do the funding on that big scale this

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,919
is a

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,440
reason why the american platforms are so

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,960
successful

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,440
we could do other things of course we

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:51,919
could raise the taxes on property

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:54,879
or taxes the big platforms like anova

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,560
like like amazon but as already it has

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,759
been mentioned that

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:03,120
rising the taxes in germany is

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:05,759
quite hard and this is not capitalism by

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,319
by its own by the way you are all so

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,639
have

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,599
big governmental investments which are

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,479
going

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,840
completely in the wrong direction so

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,199
what can we do

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,120
uh on that and uh compared to what what

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,039
is the value of open source what are

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,120
what are we contributing here and then

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,400
here it only counts not the social

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,560
aspect

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,520
then not we are free developers sorry

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,960
for that i am

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:32,000
very very much um with a resistance back

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,680
but here

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,719
if we look into the numbers we see uh

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,880
by the linux foundation survey 35 of the

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,080
developers are

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:47,920
european-based and

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,320
we make a one-third of the actual growth

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,200
with

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,720
the software in new products and this

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,080
there's another study

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,959
that 80 until 95 of some of these

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,560
products are open source so effectively

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:05,839
um there is a quarter of the growers

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,720
directly related to open source of in

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,640
europe so we have to claim this uh

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,720
success and we have to

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,399
also claim some back for this money or

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,440
we already made there's a

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:22,560
new study quantification

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:26,399
which says we are making uh every year

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:28,640
in the open source business in europe 95

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,279
billion so nearly 100 billion per year

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,320
is a

00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,200
contribution to the gdp so this is a big

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,560
number and this

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,440
is now on the table and

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,800
politics is really paying attention to

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,839
it at the moment

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,640
but his question is do we pay the right

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,279
attention

00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,440
one of the guys in the german open

00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:52,880
source business is rafael laguna

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,600
he founded open exchange

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,200
where he was ceo now he is the founding

00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,440
director of the sprint

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,880
bundesliga for spring innovation and he

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,040
is

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,959
promoting open source on the government

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,920
level there's an interview

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,720
uh and uh what i very much like and what

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,000
i don't like

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,480
for example it's a little solution

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,959
here's a pacifist at heart i'm also

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,959
so if i'm not part of the open source

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,920
business or one of the organizations

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,720
uh big organization because they have

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,120
too much

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:30,240
uh promoting for the military business

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,200
and uh the more or less the tipping

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,200
point was this

00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:40,560
2019 leipzig where the

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:43,680
christian democratic party had their

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,320
yearly pathetic so they and he could

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,880
announce

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:52,800
that open source is now the government

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,920
politics so so the biggest party in

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,040
germany which

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,760
which the longest longest tradition of

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,279
governing has now adopted open source

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,959
and they are framing a difference they

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,279
are framing it

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,480
digital is versatile so vicious wonder

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,760
is one of the things

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:13,040
you should uh smile on but

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,839
it's effectively it's a miracle

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,839
and it's a fairy tale so don't believe

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,120
in fairy tales but it's a framing which

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,079
says okay

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,720
it's as relevant as it can be for the

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,839
german

00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:29,839
economy there are other things

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:31,200
everybody wants to be on that list

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,880
but this is more interesting for the

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,839
german

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,800
politics and behind the scenes uh there

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,760
is

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,360
another motivation for going open source

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,720
we have been

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,720
had this trump administration for four

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,240
years and

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,480
it really threatened the independence of

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,600
europe and

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,600
there have been sanctions on decisions

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,240
if they are wrong or not but the

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,240
sanctions for

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,320
where should be sovereign was not

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,519
recognized

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:10,720
as a very positive sign and they

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:13,040
immediately started and this

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,839
digital sovereignty we will still have

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,959
to define it

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:19,839
took off and uh

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:20,399
yeah the bigger thing uh which was never

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,160
mentioned

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:27,279
in the official news was that there was

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:30,959
a fear of a potential cloud boycott so

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:33,839
sources in the german government told me

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,839
that they have been afraid that not only

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,519
the pipeline and the

00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,079
um and

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,920
technology boycotts on the day on the

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,760
oil pipeline not the data pipelines the

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,440
old pipeline to russia

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:52,880
um have been

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,920
threatened but also there was an

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:59,440
embargo under the hood um

00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:03,200
that uh germany would be cut off the

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,920
cloud so no amazon no google uh

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,880
no facebook anymore so this was one real

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:11,120
threat and then they

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:14,399
uh analyzed it and there was a study

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,760
a strategic marked analysis reducing the

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,279
dependency

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,920
on open source of software

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,800
windows and it came out surprise

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,000
surprise they are

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,000
heavily depending on

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,920
on software windows on proprietary

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,880
software windows

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,880
another um

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,000
another threat in the blog is uh the

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,800
data so so it's not only about open

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,079
source it's also about data

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:47,519
and in 2014

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:49,680
and uh later they framed this digital

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,480
and data is the new oil i absolutely

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,680
hate this

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,000
framing as a new oil because uh what

00:13:53,680 --> 00:14:00,839
it's effectively meaning

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:04,000
you can see here uh you see yeah

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:07,040
um what will be our deep water horizon

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,639
so this is not something

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,519
which is predictable it already has

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,720
happened we

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:17,600
see a lot of breaches and and where

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,600
data is somebody will try to catch it

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,839
and to get out of it

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,440
and what we also see is that they

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:28,320
commanded a lot of

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,320
things so the official

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:36,079
line of the government is not very

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,600
unambiguous so somebody says yeah we

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,480
want to have everything free and

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,680
anything

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:45,279
and in the same same

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:48,720
department they say okay we make this

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:54,000
i.t security uh because that's

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:57,519
a law which is effectively restricting

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,839
our freedom and this uh

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,760
for all the non-germans these germans

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,639
violence fantasies are propagating to

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,880
the euro

00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,920
european level and come back and then

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:13,839
they go into law this is not a big

00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:13,839
not a very friendly approach on that

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,839
the role of the hyperscalers is very

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,920
questionable so uh

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:21,920
you have seen the value is in the

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:25,519
trillions or

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:28,720
german billions of money and what

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,959
we also don't like is that they are

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,240
aggravating customer and partner data on

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,880
a big scale

00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,040
and amazon is very famous for squeezing

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:41,040
partners out of the business

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:43,279
and corey doctorov calls the um

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,720
amazon ecosystem the kill zone so

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,759
effectively our

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:51,600
entire economy will be killed because of

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:54,320
these business practices and

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,920
we have seen notorious gdpr violations

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,480
the cloud act

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,600
and customers are forced into the cloud

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,040
for example the office

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:06,720
365 disaster which is

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:09,120
completely cutting us off from from

00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,600
running our own version even even if we

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,800
have paid for the proprietary solution

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:16,320
so this is not really something which is

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,560
acceptable

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:22,639
and another thing which does not work

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,079
is everything about intellectual

00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:26,240
property so intellectual

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,279
property has failed on nearly every

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,600
scale from

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:35,199
very big a few uh lines of few nodes in

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:38,399
music to disney laws to

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:42,480
patents on in

00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,720
in the industry so uh and together with

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,639
code and data this means who owns the

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,880
code who owns the data

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,079
i think this is an unsolvable problem

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:55,120
and this is all

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:55,120
going to be addressed at the moment

00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,480
we have intrinsic arguments here against

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,839
intellectual property so intrinsic means

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,760
only business

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,319
arguments it's an ineffective method of

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,000
control

00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:12,799
it's slow um it is not really

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,799
um making giving us anything you have

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,640
seen the throne of the mp3 example

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,839
fraunhofer has split in

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,839
separate parts there are parts say we

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,439
cannot open source our code because it

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,919
weakens all patterns

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,959
you say see the entire framing at the

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,200
moment

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,799
is completely wrong so other parts of

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:36,559
throne of support open source and then

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:41,360
it's a transition you see this kind of

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:41,360
transition in everywhere

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,760
and this is one of these strategic

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,280
market analysis so

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:52,720
they they say uh in in a pdf

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:55,200
uh yeah we are depending on

00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,640
microsoft and other software providers

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,039
and this is something i

00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,440
i'll just linked it if you want to read

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,480
it but this is what we told them

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,120
20 years ago okay

00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,679
these are consultants yeah they are paid

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,400
a lot

00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:13,120
and uh here is a positive thing so now i

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:16,480
will talk about digital sovereignty

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:19,760
and sovereignty itself is quite

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,880
difficult wording so in in the us

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:26,640
serenity is related a little bit to

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:29,919
uh extreme right if you

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:33,280
don't take care and in this case digital

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:35,440
sovereignty means um the best definition

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,960
i have seen here is from peter guns

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:41,440
it's a concept that you as an individual

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,640
an organization or a state

00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:48,720
uh allow to determine where

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:51,840
you want to um place your personal data

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,080
and how it should be used and this is

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,080
this is something which is absolutely

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,559
comfortable even to the chaos computer

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,320
club

00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,720
this is this is working in a way that we

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,200
can

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:08,400
say okay this is a definition we can

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,120
can work on and this is the definition

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,640
we can

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:15,679
really use even in our contracts

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,679
and he has declared four principles i

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,080
think it's a little bit analog to the

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:23,520
four freedoms of the gpl

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:26,559
and yeah

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,200
you need the right uh to store the data

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,120
wherever you want

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,640
it should be there should be standards

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:38,480
or standards should be open source

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,720
um and cloud services must be in a way

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,080
that you follow the principles of the

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:46,080
internet

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:48,880
the open citizens must be interconnected

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,679
without the need and the consent of a

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:53,919
central

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:57,600
authority and education is a big part of

00:19:53,919 --> 00:20:00,640
the concept so you really need to

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,640
educate people on it

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,080
and then one of these outcomes was this

00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,200
project

00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,360
guide so this is our bonus minister

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:15,120
admirer so he's a secretary of state

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:19,039
in the department of

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:23,360
business or of economy and energy

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:25,679
and they very much claimed here we have

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,280
this digital summit and now we are

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,240
promoting it and

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,200
and uh he's missing on this photo

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,760
because

00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,559
he was so excited about this new step

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,600
that he

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:40,960
immediately had an accident and

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,000
fall off the stairs and and he was not

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,559
able to attend

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:49,120
what you also see is there is a lot of

00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:50,000
a lot of people here will not really

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,039
contribute

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,400
to the digital development of germany

00:20:53,039 --> 00:21:00,799
um the worst guy is uh

00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:03,600
um is a official one of the official

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,120
digital ministers of attack telemetry

00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,400
communication

00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:11,120
and traffic and here is the reality in

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,480
germany 70 kilometers away from this

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,360
digital summit

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:18,000
the fastest way of transporting data is

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:21,600
by horse with

00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:25,760
which dvd on it and

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:27,679
by using the book by by

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,159
promoting the internet in mecklenburg

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,720
football in the east in east germany

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,720
um they have effectively cut off the

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:38,000
telephone lines because

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:41,919
the line the digital

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,720
wireless networks the phone network is

00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,360
so weak that you cannot carry voice over

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,880
ap

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:52,159
and then some parts of

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,159
eastern germany have really no

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,200
access to the internet which is a

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:59,440
catastrophe

00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:03,280
in times of pandemic

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:07,280
okay the next step was uh yes

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:09,840
as yuria already mentioned there is no

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,200
single country which can govern open

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,320
source process so

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,200
first invitation always goes to france

00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,919
and so the outcome is an european

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,440
initiative

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:24,960
so it's uh at the end it will be

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,280
an uh aisbo so it's

00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,799
by belgian law it's a association

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:32,320
international

00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:36,080
but lucrative and you have

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:39,360
22 founding members from the

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:42,159
industry so this means

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,159
it's not a government-run project

00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,720
anymore it's an industry-run product and

00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,159
this is

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,960
very much constructed of does the way

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,080
um the german internet is constructed so

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,600
the d6 is

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:57,760
also um

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,280
a german gunmetal shaft so it's also a

00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,080
non-profit organization

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,360
and they build all the backbones and the

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,520
internet

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,480
uh traffic in germany it works quite

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,240
well

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:14,080
and um yeah you will have 300

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,960
members which means um there is a big

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,000
support

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,960
by the german uh and the european

00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,200
industry so

00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:25,039
so it's really um on an industrial scale

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:29,120
you see all the

00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:32,159
uh all the participants i've worked for

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,559
seven of them uh not related with gaia x

00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,000
but

00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:38,080
uh yeah so this is more or less a good

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,120
representation

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,760
but also uh this palantiyan is not the

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,080
drupal volunteer is a volunteer which is

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,600
uh responsible for the surveillance

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:51,039
everywhere

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,960
wanted to attend which means to

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:55,039
uh we needed a clarification so the

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,840
clarification here is definitely is this

00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:58,080
is

00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,679
everybody has one vote if you are in

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,760
this ispl

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,440
and if you are google or if you are a

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,400
small company

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,720
you have the same number of votes which

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,760
is exactly one so if palantir wants to

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,320
join

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,520
and they can join then they have exactly

00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,880
one vote

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:20,480
and not cannot dominate even if the big

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,400
cloud the hyperscalers

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,720
would attend they only would have one

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,720
voice

00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:32,400
so politics we already mentioned what is

00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,559
gaia x by the way you see a lot of

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,400
interesting colored slides and here it

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:38,480
is about the data spaces

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,440
it's about connecting data and software

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,520
here is

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,799
where i feel a little bit more familiar

00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,520
effectively

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,640
it's an openstack cluster or some

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,760
platform

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,720
and there's kind of kubernetes on top of

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,760
it with all the

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:56,240
network uh issues and the connections

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,400
um so this is where why i feel home in

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,600
the ix project so i know

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,080
most of the technologies and this is

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,279
quite

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:07,679
an interesting technology

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,799
stack it's quite complicated but it

00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,840
works

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:14,159
and here you see what they intend they

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,440
want to have a federated system of

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,600
independent clouds and they can have

00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,039
different levels from a very public

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,080
level to a very

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:26,559
isolated level and they all come can be

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,880
interconnected in a very very defined

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:31,520
way so your data can flow

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,400
from your hospital into a cloud

00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:36,880
provider's data center in a very defined

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,320
and protected flow this is the intention

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,039
behind it

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:43,279
and there is the sovereign cloud stack

00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:47,120
which is more or less a hello world of

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:50,559
gaia x it is on github and the people

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:54,480
who brought it there are

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:56,559
it's more or less the creme de la creme

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,679
of the german open source

00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:03,120
um developer so-called

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:06,159
garlov is the main driver and he was

00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:09,919
one of the troll developers at zusa

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:11,200
and and peter gunn and the other also

00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:16,559
contribute a lot of

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,559
the politics and code in this project

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,400
what else there is a demonstrator you

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,440
can click it

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:28,159
it effectively feels like linux in

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:30,799
1991 so this makes me 30 years

00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,799
younger so i like it but it's definitely

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:34,880
not

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:37,679
finished yet it will be available end of

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,679
the year you will have

00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,880
there are already demonstrators how it

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:44,960
works so please

00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:46,080
try it out and and if you are able to

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,440
contribute

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:52,880
please contribute

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:55,600
another thing which is quite interesting

00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,960
was a corona app so effectively the

00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,880
highest

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:03,520
instance of computer security is not

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,200
um it's not an official institution but

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,720
it's a chaos computer computer has

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,640
absolutely v2 blocking power so if

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,840
they don't like your solution and can

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,360
cricket in

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:17,360
the live session um it's done so what

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,399
happened to the german

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:23,520
eid personalized wise and

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:28,240
here with this activity

00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,240
for in the german corona app they

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:35,520
gain more that's the highest level of

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:38,960
supports of cars computer computer club

00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,159
said we cannot complain so this is more

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,520
or less

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:46,480
uh what you need and then the

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,360
initiatives uh took off so this is one

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,120
this

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:52,320
the german digital secretary of state is

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,679
marcus victor

00:27:52,320 --> 00:28:00,000
bond he is more or less a cio

00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,000
of the german government

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:07,440
computing so uh and he is driving

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,440
a lot of initiatives christina lung and

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,720
she's a co-founder of tech for germany

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,720
it's supported from another

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:17,919
digital secretary of state council arms

00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,720
missile sources is the highest

00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,480
um people in in germany support at the

00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,159
moment open source under the

00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,320
this is quite necessary because the

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,840
biggest project i know of at the moment

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,760
is the online touring squad so it's

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:33,200
online access law

00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:36,640
it's a law which

00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,640
requires that every

00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:40,240
buddhist land every country in in

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:44,240
germany and every

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,919
contributor puts one of these building

00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,760
blocks of the entire german

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,559
administration

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:53,120
into an open source project so this is a

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:55,440
real huge open source project

00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,640
and it must everything must be open

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,360
source and it's

00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,440
based on kubernetes so you see a lot of

00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,039
micro services here and if you

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,679
have ever worked in a bigger

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:08,240
microservice problem this means we have

00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,600
you have a real huge distributed system

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,200
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:17,039
services which turns out to be

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:20,720
whatever few thousand different micro

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:23,600
different containers uh there is

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,480
it enforces automatically a different

00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,399
organization

00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:31,039
cicd pipelines uh security

00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,399
process changes everything you need you

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,760
have to address a tech

00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,919
vector because this will be a

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,720
first-class target

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,240
and this does not work with open source

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,600
and everybody knows that

00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:47,200
it's not possible to build this

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:47,200
with proprietary solutions

00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:55,840
so yeah this is a standard

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:57,679
control council they complained a lot of

00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,399
the government in germany this is

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,640
something i've been part of

00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:04,960
this there will be a governmental code

00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:08,000
for not because we

00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,640
are not able to use

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,080
github but because we have as you

00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,520
already mentioned

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:18,880
um we have to lower

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:21,840
as a barrier to contributions this means

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,159
uh every it should be easy for everybody

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:27,520
in the german administrative

00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:29,360
administration to contribute to code to

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,799
take hold and it should be legally

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,000
compliant

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:36,000
and there should be everything

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,679
integratable it could be integrated in

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,840
ix it will be opened of course

00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,600
um it will be another open source

00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,720
repository where you where the german

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,080
government

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:51,279
hopefully will guarantee that this

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,880
code which is there is compliant to all

00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,640
the rules and all the laws

00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,200
and then it can be reused in europe and

00:30:54,640 --> 00:31:00,640
we will also reuse a lot of code from

00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,200
other european countries and

00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,000
um already in the news is the planning

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,279
for the center

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,840
of digital sovereignty i am disclaimer

00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,559
i'm under nda but what you can read in

00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,159
the news

00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:17,279
already without me breaking the nda

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:21,440
is that it will be a very huge

00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:21,440
hospital and it will be um

00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:26,480
[Music]

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,640
have a lot of connections to all other

00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,080
ospos and open source projects without

00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,720
taking over

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,880
open source products it cannot really

00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:38,399
control everything but it will be a

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:41,679
big and and first stop for all

00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:42,399
um projects which have relations to the

00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:47,039
government

00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:50,320
in the near future

00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:52,880
another thing personally because i like

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,559
also the approach of getting independent

00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,960
of

00:31:54,559 --> 00:32:02,080
the hardware dependencies the risk 5

00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,399
project is taking off in europe uh

00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,279
because nvidia has acquired arm for 40

00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,120
billion

00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,320
it's hardware so therefore i did not

00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,559
mention it

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,440
intel more or less is in a burnt out

00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:15,279
state

00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,399
but it's more or less not usable anymore

00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:19,600
in a security

00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:21,679
environment and risk 5

00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,919
will be an independent architecture

00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:27,440
because the risk 5 architecture is under

00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,159
the bsd license so we can use it and

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,279
there are

00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,399
european initiatives uh which will be

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:35,840
hopefully

00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:38,720
in the next few years lead to

00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,000
completely independent hardware so

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,399
hopefully see

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,320
processors supercomputer processors

00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,360
which are faster than what we see at the

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:51,600
moment

00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:51,600
from the big contributors in 2024.

00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:59,679
what is missing not everything is

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,559
is under open source and some of the

00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,519
promises

00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:05,840
are still broken even the german health

00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:09,039
system gematic is delivering but not

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,880
everything i i think and what is

00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:15,519
not delivered at the moment is the

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:18,960
source code of the bundeswehr

00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:22,320
passport systems and they

00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:25,200
try behind the scenes because they are

00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,760
controlled by secret services in germany

00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,880
uh

00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,080
to get to keep as much control as

00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,480
possible

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,360
and this will be um it's a little bit

00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,120
sad because

00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:39,200
uh some of these initiatives to get your

00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,559
passport on your mobile phone

00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:45,519
should and must be open source and

00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:46,799
uh otherwise they will be broken and i'm

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,519
looking forward to

00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:51,039
the talks where somebody on stage is

00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,880
going to break it and

00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,320
to break out of the secure samsung

00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,860
containers

00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,080
it's a challenge but

00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:59,840
[Music]

00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,600
what i've seen so far is that there are

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:05,519
people who will make a

00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:08,639
phd thesis out of it so the conclusions

00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:11,679
at the moment yeah uh open source is

00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:14,240
um going big in

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,599
uh business now and accepted by the

00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,359
government

00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,639
and we see a lot of progress we are in

00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:21,359
the transition phase

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:23,119
we have many gaps partly public sector

00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,240
has an absolutely brown field so there

00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:28,560
is no something

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,560
we can write new code from scratch

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,280
projects are struggling but not by

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,359
technical issues

00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,639
even even individual efforts can have a

00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:39,760
big impact if you

00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,480
promote it to the right person you will

00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,200
be

00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,960
invited to a board where you can decide

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:49,119
so

00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:51,599
stay tuned fighting for this kind of

00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:54,079
data sovereignty is a big driver in the

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,919
german government at the moment

00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,480
see a lot of progress a lot of building

00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:02,720
areas uh and it's important

00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,520
so yeah that's what i wanted to tell you

00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,320
if you want to

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,440
contact me uh i will be in the right

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,720
position

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:17,839
after this let's

00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:17,839
let's go and

00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,560
thank you very much uh thomas for your

00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:27,119
talk

00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,119
um yes there is actually there is one

00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,000
question maybe we can do that real quick

00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,599
um before we go

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,280
over to the breakout room um

00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,839
someone asked what do you think is the

00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,880
way forward is it projects like gaia x

00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:42,839
or if it's not um what do you think is

00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:46,079
missing at the moment

00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:48,160
uh i think gaia x is a big progress

00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,680
because now we can build our own clouds

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,040
so we don't have to wear the

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:55,839
t-shirts the cloud is just another

00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,839
guy's computer and now we will have we

00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,480
will be able to build our own cloud in a

00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:02,400
separate

00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:04,240
environment it's like linux in 1991

00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,800
nobody would have believed that somebody

00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,480
could clone the unix kernel and make a

00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,920
public project out of it nobody would

00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,960
have believed it at that time

00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,240
but it happened and the complexity is

00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,119
immense but we will

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:19,359
handle it and we will learn it and the

00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:22,320
other things which are lacking

00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:23,680
yeah we will see we have to now we can

00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,800
make the pressure

00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,560
um if the official institutions are on

00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,760
board and if somebody in the government

00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:32,240
asks why

00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,359
is the software for your id card not
