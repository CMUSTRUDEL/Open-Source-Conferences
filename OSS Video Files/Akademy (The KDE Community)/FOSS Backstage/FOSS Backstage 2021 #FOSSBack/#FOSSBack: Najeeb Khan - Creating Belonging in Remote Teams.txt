Title: #FOSSBack: Najeeb Khan - Creating Belonging in Remote Teams
Publication date: 2021-03-02
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Remote teams are more disconnected and fragmented now more than ever. 54% of employees are unattached from their work & company. They put in the time, but not energy or passion, often doing the minimum required.

75% of managers struggle to maintain the culture remotely and it leads to 18% drop in productivity for the team. It impacts mental health, well-being, and churn of employees.


By creating belonging through social interaction at work, it not only improves the well-being of the employees but also increases productivity.

	00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,800
so hey everyone my name is najib

00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,599
um as he mentioned i'm going to be cr

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,920
creating a

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,519
talk about quitting belonging in remote

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,520
teams

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,359
it's no surprise right now everyone's

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,680
really used to working remotely

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,320
and as we call it you know we're in our

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,480
second inning of remote work

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,160
for a lot of companies or organizations

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,760
what they're really struggling with

00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,760
is hey we are we have 80 people on zoom

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,280
but yet even though we have so many

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,399
people on zoom

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,040
we still feel isolated sometimes

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,559
working remotely feels lonely for a lot

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,559
of people

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:49,039
so how do we get your remote team

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:49,840
to be more connected than ever before

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,760
that

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,760
is what i want to share in this talk

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,280
well let's start with you know why

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,320
people choose

00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,160
remote work you know so right now

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,400
the reason why people choose remote work

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,960
is well because

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,159
they have to they don't really have much

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,799
choice

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,240
but what about before why did people

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,040
choose remote work well

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,880
there were a whole bunch of reasons one

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,360
flexible schedule

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,720
working from anywhere having no commute

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,159
spending time with family and the

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,640
ability to work from home was

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,799
largely one of the reasons that people

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,159
worked from home

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,159
and personally for myself i work

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,840
remotely for eight years

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:36,000
and again when we have

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,560
got impacted by kovid one thing i do

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,960
want to point out is working from only

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,240
normal times a versus working remotely

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,560
during the pandemic

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:49,439
is two different things well

00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,680
this is how and why people are choosing

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,000
it

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,240
but how have our lives been impacted

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,680
well if you look at the transition

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,840
of everything into remote work

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,880
a gartner study found that company

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,600
leaders found that

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,360
80 percent allow employees to work

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,680
remotely at least part of the time

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,479
after the pandemic and almost half will

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,840
allow

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,680
them to work full time so it's impacted

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,080
in the companies

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,680
not only in first thing which is the

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,120
talent because a lot of people are

00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,239
choosing remote work

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,160
but also productivity because

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,360
this is impacting because people are

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,440
able to kind of focus

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,440
for the most part again it depends on

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,280
family situations but overall

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,959
people are able to be more productive

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,879
than they were in the office

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:39,680
including job satisfaction and living

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,680
because remote work has impacted how we

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,920
are buying real estate and a lot of

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,120
city centers are being displaced and

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,720
people are going to

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:54,879
other open areas like the suburbs

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,920
that is all the benefits of it

00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,800
but what's next we've overlooked

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,560
the downsides the biggest struggles with

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,920
working remotely

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,200
is one collaboration

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,840
and two loneliness these two encompass a

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,680
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,040
of the challenges and not even

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,360
mentioning being in a different time

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,480
zone than your teammates

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,519
so we're connected every single minute

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,640
yet we still feel isolated we have slack

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,400
project management tool video

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,000
conferencing emails notifications upon

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,640
notifications yet we still find it

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,799
difficult

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,159
to connect tech has progressed in all

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,560
areas but without the proper

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:37,120
use of tools or feeling left alone

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,760
and when it comes to managers their

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,080
struggles

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,400
are the two biggest struggles are

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,319
maintaining company culture

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:49,040
and team cohesiveness almost 70 percent

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,000
struggle with both of them but what do

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,239
we do

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,519
well even though remote teams are more

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,680
disconnected and fragmented

00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,720
the thing is half of employees are

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,799
feeling unattached

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,560
to their company they put in the time

00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:06,480
and they do the bare minimum work

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,560
this leads to productivity and burnout

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,000
and how do we solve it well we have to

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,560
understand

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,280
that it is not a once and done kind of

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,640
activity

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,840
it's like farming it's going to take

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,600
some time at the same time

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,079
it's like working out as well but the

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,000
good news is

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,840
there are different ways of doing it if

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,560
you take a look at the different

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,360
phases of a company from forming to

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,240
storming to norming to performing

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,040
we can create different solutions for

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,040
different

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,160
types of team members and where they are

00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,800
on a journey

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,560
for people who are just starting to join

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,040
a team we can bring them

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,360
in a better fashion get and have them

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,040
get to know others casually

00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,639
for storming when there's conflict

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,680
resolution having

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,720
being listened to and having

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,560
understanding helps a lot

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,560
when it comes to norming which is

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,880
improving cooperation

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,840
entertainment deepening relationships it

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,160
can be both sync

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,120
and async and when it comes to

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,400
performing

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,520
in recognizing the employee there's

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,919
self needs and motivation both

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,800
intrinsically and intrinsically helps a

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,560
balance

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,440
all that in the future one interesting

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,360
quote i heard from one of the holiday

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,039
parties that i hosted through patio

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,400
was that i like this party because

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,560
there's no pressure to drink

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,400
or dance or dress up we have to

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,199
recognize that employees have different

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,240
needs and

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:38,400
one solution doesn't fit for everyone

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,680
so if we all work together and work with

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,400
the team

00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,520
to create the different activities and

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,240
ongoing

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,680
situations that helps them to belong the

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,919
better it is

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,919
whether it's a virtual cooking class or

00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,680
yoga or weekly games night there are a

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:57,039
lot of options

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,960
ultimately it comes down to the

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,639
team itself i've had hundreds of

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,240
managers ask me

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,240
for team building ideas i always start

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,919
with what's the goal is it to get to

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,680
know others casually is it to

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,520
have cooperation motivation or

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,039
entertainment because once you can

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,639
understand from that point of view it

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,319
helps a lot

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,479
now it might take five to ten hours a

00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,160
month doing this you can do it yourself

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,120
or you can get a partner to do this for

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,120
you

00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,479
in the end it's needed because when it's

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,360
done right it'll improve the

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,759
productivity

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,759
mental health and well-being of

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,639
employees

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,080
i've hosted several holiday parties and

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,800
this was one of

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,840
the most crucial learnings that i've

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,319
learned

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,160
so if you have any questions or if

00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,680
you're still trying to figure out hey

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,600
do you have any ideas for team building

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,520
or how i can help for my team

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:48,400
just let me know you can just reach me

00:06:45,520 --> 00:07:03,840
