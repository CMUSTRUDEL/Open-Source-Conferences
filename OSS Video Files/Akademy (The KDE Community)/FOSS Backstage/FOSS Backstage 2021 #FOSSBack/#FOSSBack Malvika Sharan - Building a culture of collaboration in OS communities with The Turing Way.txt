Title: #FOSSBack Malvika Sharan - Building a culture of collaboration in OS communities with The Turing Way
Publication date: 2021-03-01
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	The Turing Way (https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome) is an Open Source project that involves and supports a diverse research community in ensuring that reproducible, collaborative, ethical and inclusive data research is "too easy not to do". Using this project as a model, I will discuss the importance of collaborative development, documentation and sharing open practices that can be adopted by various stakeholders in Open Source to make their work more reproducible and effective.

Built upon a culture of collaboration, The Turing Way is designed to be welcoming, inclusive and accessible to its members from diverse backgrounds and expertise. It is an open source project, that facilitates all contributions, questions, comments, and discussions via an online repository: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way. Since last year, more than 200 researchers have contributed to this project. They have co-authored chapters and developed resources that have been used by the scientific communities worldwide in learning and promoting reproducible methods in different computational research communities.

The project has grown from a small team of 10 researchers to a community of collaborators from around the world. The scope of The Turing Way book has also expanded to include the different aspects of reproducibility, project design, collaboration, communication, and ethics in data research. We continue to support our members in learning new skills and facilitate their interaction with the project via online co-working spaces and mentored-contributions.

We believe that Open Source projects like The Turing Way, that promote a culture of collaboration, can have a significant impact on improving access to information and the equitable decision-making process by our peers and future generations. We further invite FOSS participants to make use of The Turing Way and participate in its community by contributing and enhancing its resources with their perspectives.

hi everyone

00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,120
my name is malvika sharon and i will be

00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,240
talking about building a culture of

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,719
collaboration

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,240
in open source communities i will give

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,880
examples from my work

00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,800
as a community manager of the turingbay

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,880
the turingway

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,920
is an open source project that involves

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,320
and supports

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,840
its diverse community in making data

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,840
science reproducible

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,160
ethical collaborative and inclusive for

00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,840
everyone

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,480
we believe that to make our project

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,079
truly beneficial and comprehensible

00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,920
we need to collaborate with people with

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,520
diverse skills backgrounds

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,440
and domain knowledge this project is a

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,120
part of the alan turing institute

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,360
which is the national institute for data

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,120
science and artificial intelligence

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,120
in the uk the turing way is developed

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,719
under the research program called tools

00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,199
practices and systems

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,199
and the goal of this program includes

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,280
providing trustworthy system

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,879
transparent reporting inclusive

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,159
interoperable design

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:09,119
ethical integrity respectful co-creation

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,040
and leadership in open research the

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,520
cheering way sits across most of these

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,840
goals

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,720
and provides a central resource for good

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,119
practices

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,920
to all our researchers within the uk and

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,920
internationally

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,479
it was started by christopher taker as a

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,720
book on reproducibility

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,840
shared as a lightly opinionated guide

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,320
this book provides

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,320
reproducible tools and practices to help

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,360
ensure that the phd students

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,600
postdocs pi funding teams

00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,880
and all other stakeholders know what is

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,759
their responsibility

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,680
of reproducibility where they can make

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,640
impact and how they can make their work

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,680
more efficient

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,680
and understandable

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,520
reproducibility is when the same

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,680
analysis

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,479
is applied to the same data set it

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,320
should give same result

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,200
it is quite simple to define but

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,640
involves making making complex decisions

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,040
at every step of the way so it starts

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,119
right

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,479
at the research idea you want to

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,959
communicate with others

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,239
the plan and the design that you have in

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,239
mind

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,480
then you describe your protocol collect

00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,920
data sets you start processing and

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,319
wrangling your data

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,520
conduct your studies and analysis

00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,360
publish your work

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,520
and other research components so

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,920
everyone can access it

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,599
then comes archiving data to ensure that

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,280
your data is reusable

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:33,519
meaning that someone else can go through

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,560
this whole process of reproducing

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,400
and building upon your work that's quite

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,280
an overwhelming process

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,160
moreover it does not just involve data

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,080
practices

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,360
but also includes the way we communicate

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,519
our work with other

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,200
how we design our project how

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,239
efficiently we collaborate with each

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,920
other

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,239
all these while ensuring that we

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:58,400
maintain highest ethical standards

00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,920
and research integrity in our research

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,239
so in order to accommodate all these

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,159
requirement in research in data science

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,319
the project expanded to include four

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,159
more four more guides in addition to the

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,920
guide on reproducible research

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,480
we have guide on project design

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,519
communication collaboration and ethical

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,280
research

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,720
and we also record all the community

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,080
practices that we are building and

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,680
practicing within the touring

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,680
way in our community handbook

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,200
we have seen our project and community

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,760
grow in the last two years

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,440
we currently host over 134 subchapters

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,440
across five guides

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,680
in order to ensure that our community

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,200
members are able to participate

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,200
irrespective of their previous

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,159
experiences of working with open source

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,879
community

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,680
we provide the resources guidance

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,319
templates

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,799
trainings and pathways that they can use

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:50,080
to stay involved in the community

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:53,040
we have over 250 direct contributors on

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,120
github and over 1 thousands of thousands

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,959
of users for example

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,120
we have a set of illustration that i

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,680
have intensively used in my talk today

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,400
have been downloaded over 4 000 times we

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,640
have 500 subscribers of our newsletter

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,400
over 1600 twitter followers and about

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,840
150 people who participate on a

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,920
day-to-day conversation

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,519
so for a community that started at a

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,599
grass root level

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,680
we are very grateful that these members

00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,560
work with us

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,199
so just to summarize the touring book or

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,600
project

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,520
it's a book but it's a community where

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,720
people come together to collaborate and

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,960
write chapters

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,040
build and maintain resources share their

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,120
skills and ideas around best practices

00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,040
in data science and research

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,759
we apply open source principle in the

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,759
development maintenance of the book

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,000
finally it's built on the culture of

00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,800
collaboration which is the process

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,160
and the backbone of our project so that

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,919
was about the touring way

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,240
next i will be sharing practices

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,160
examples and insights from this project

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,840
to further discuss how we can promote a

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,600
culture of collaboration in open source

00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,600
communities

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,520
let's look at three areas of challenges

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,919
that i will explore in my talk

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,639
open source communities community

00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,160
members

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,560
and building collaboration among the

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,880
members

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,320
let's start by defining what open source

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,240
community means

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,240
an open source community refers to

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,960
collaborative efforts in an open source

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,320
software

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,440
or resource development that anyone can

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,120
join

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,639
they can collaborate to determine

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,800
direction and goals

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,800
and the result will be made available

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,160
under a free license

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,280
in my opinion there are a lot of

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,759
assumption there that anyone can join

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,520
that things will happen collaboratively

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,720
and that all the outputs will be made

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,039
available

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,759
these are expectations that we cannot

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,600
ensure that they will happen

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,800
before we come back to discussing this

00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,440
issue in detail

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,880
let's see who the members are these

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,280
people share common goals

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,520
and values in the project such as intent

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,199
to develop the software or resource

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,919
but they come from diverse backgrounds

00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,240
and come with different expectation

00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,319
a project can have an overarching vision

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,520
but each member who joined the project

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,520
have personal purpose these visions and

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:12,160
purpose leads them to support the open

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,800
source movement

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,560
as a result they collaborate in the open

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,840
source community

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,080
and they also experience different

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,400
challenges

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,479
based on their personal needs skills and

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,720
backgrounds

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,960
they will also face lots of barriers in

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,720
participation

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,240
so we saw two sets of challenge so we

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,280
know that there are assumption in open

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,360
source community

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,759
definition and there are barriers that

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,160
each member face

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,520
the third component of my talk is

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,080
building collaboration

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,840
which is the valuable for working

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,840
towards open source communities and

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,360
project and also to meet our personal

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,759
goals

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,120
i will explain this part in levels of

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,199
importance

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,240
the central of all the work that we do

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,520
is the product

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,280
that could be a software or a resource

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,720
then maintaining highest level of

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,120
scientific integrity

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,400
such as reproducibility accessibility

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,560
ethical standards

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,520
that make our work more reliable and

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,919
useful for our users

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,880
now the third level is the collaborative

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,639
work which is

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,720
very much required for the development

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,479
and sustainability of a community

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,440
where most time and resources are

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:26,720
invested this level includes development

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:30,080
testing documenting sharing archiving

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,400
and promoting the project

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,080
fourth level of collaboration is by

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,160
members who might not have been

00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,880
originally involved in designing the

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,960
project

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,319
but they want to participate they

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,160
require support

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,680
in getting on-boarded in the project

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,560
they would like to know what tasks they

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,160
can do

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,840
what kind of training could help them

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,520
fill any gap they may have

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,599
and in the best case scenario they can

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,879
receive mentoring to actually become

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,919
part of this process

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,840
and take on meaningful roles

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,599
this will require existing members to

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,720
welcome them review their work

00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,360
and provide good feedback often this is

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,199
the level

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,280
where work starts to increase for people

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,440
in open source

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,319
often these people are working as

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,960
volunteers

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,960
they are working beyond their day job

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,919
but also this is the part which is

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:20,080
very crucial it's crucial to ensure that

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,879
we are proactively promoting inclusive

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,960
approaches

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,000
to welcome diverse ideas from different

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,759
skill sets

00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,840
we do not want to exclude people

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,520
unintentionally by not providing the

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,159
support that they need to become part of

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,640
this community

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,200
finally comes the level which is often

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,599
hidden

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,599
which is the reason why it's written in

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,519
small font but also there are just too

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,360
many of those hidden works

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,959
these are tasks that goes into

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,959
developing inclusive culture

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,200
maintaining communication having

00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,360
interaction that are positive for people

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,800
providing guidelines making sure that

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,760
there is diversity

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,440
in terms of representation and ideas

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,320
ensure that we have pathways for

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,959
onboarding

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,800
and also off-boarding find funding

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,360
maintain transparency

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,800
have a governance publish reports and

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,480
incentivize people

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,560
help it build opportunities for

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,839
connection and make sure that people are

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,000
not burnt out

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,279
while we embed accessibility in all the

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,680
pathway

00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,640
and also please insert anything that

00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,560
often

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,839
stay hidden in open source and deserves

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,839
more recognition

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,279
this is also where most work around

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,360
community building happens

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,560
and that's where i want to focus the

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,320
rest of my talk

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,640
exploring the challenges that we have

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:38,000
just discussed in order to make

00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,600
collaboration successful

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,519
and effective among open source

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,320
community members we need to first

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,440
understand

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:48,560
and accept that open by default is

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:52,800
not inclusive or accessible

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:54,480
or led by definition we saw that open

00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,320
source community only means that people

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,959
are collaborating to build something to

00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,680
make them

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,480
available online and honestly that is

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,360
not enough

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,200
we need to bring people in if we want

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,920
these aspects to become part of the

00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,760
process

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,519
we need to intentionally design our

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,040
project to make people a part of the

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,959
development process

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,160
the human center design approach to make

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,959
sure that we move from

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,079
open to inclusive practices in community

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,839
which is accessible

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:24,480
for everyone and where everyone

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,480
contributes in a way that we count them

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,519
community building is a process of

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,600
granting access to skill and support

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,360
and individual or group needs to

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,640
participate in a community

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,320
and influence decision making process

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,160
the key to intentional community

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,399
building is to have more people

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,200
involved in the decision making process

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,880
this means

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,440
that diverse contributors are given

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,920
opportunities to come into the project

00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,360
with different perspective participate

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,839
in the development process

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,560
and integrate their combined values in

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,920
the product

00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,720
by design only such a product will truly

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,360
truly be

00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:04,320
relatable useful and beneficial for

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,320
diverse users

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,760
the end goal of building a community

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,760
through collaboration

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,200
is to distribute power equally

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:13,279
throughout the community

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,360
so the decision making is not conducted

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,600
by one person with most power

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,560
that can be detrimental to most people

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,839
in the community

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,760
who may not get their voices heard

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,279
as a community builder i spend most of

00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,440
my career thinking about

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,760
the development of practices around

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,279
building inclusive communities

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,160
and there are five points that i want to

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,160
share with you today

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:41,040
lesson one design for inclusion because

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:43,120
inclusion shouldn't be an afterthought

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,160
we can use open leadership principles

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,720
for that open

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,240
leadership principle for the design and

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,040
mozilla foundation

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,639
and they are set of practices and skills

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,480
people can use in projects

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,800
that allows them to collaborate within

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,200
and inclusive communities

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,480
there are three simple rules of open

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,120
leadership

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,680
first understanding so that your work is

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,120
clear

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:10,720
authentic and widely accessible

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:15,120
sharing so that your work can be adapted

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,120
reproduced and built upon by others

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,760
and third is participation and inclusion

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,560
so that we create a sense of shared

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,720
ownership

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:26,480
that inspires contributions

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,760
in the turing way every little

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,160
contribution counts

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,040
we foster a culture of collaboration by

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,959
ensuring

00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,959
that the collaboration is not defined

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:39,120
just by the common goals

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:40,320
the product of the team or

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,399
what kind of knowledge they are

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,240
exchanging on the top level

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,160
but we also take time to make sure that

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,680
people are given the inclusive workspace

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,399
that they need to perform their

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,160
best that they treat each other kindly

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,079
abide by code of conduct

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,160
know what roles they can have and

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,240
contribute to building diverse teams

00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,839
by explicitly opening ideas for

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,320
contribution

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,880
in all our work we apply open leadership

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,200
principles

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,200
we also define pathways for contribution

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,720
that always require multiple people to

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,639
support each other

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,320
for example people are invited to

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,440
develop and share resources within the

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,959
cheering way

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,720
we support people by mentored

00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,600
contribution where an experienced

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,440
contributor

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,360
reviews the contributions made by new

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,120
contributors

00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,279
we also create opportunities for people

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,040
to maintain and improve resources

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,639
so high level maintenance and

00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,639
improvements are very important but

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,760
equally important are to invite new

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,399
members to help

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,279
in smaller tasks this could be fixing a

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,839
broken link

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,519
or fixing a bug or updating an outdated

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,519
resource

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,959
these are listed as issue for first-time

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,760
contributors with

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,600
good first issue labels that can be

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,560
identified by relatively new

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,199
contributors they can help fix these so

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,600
fixing

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,279
bugs or broken links may not be the real

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,600
purpose of our contributors

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:03,680
but these allow them to build confidence

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,680
in contributing to a new project

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,519
people who share our resources more

00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,600
widely are also our contributors

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,199
as they communicate our work often

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,880
writing blogs giving contra

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,399
conference talk on behalf of the

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,839
community

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:17,920
then there are people who are more

00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,760
interested in reviewing and updating

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,560
existing resources which is extremely

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,480
valuable

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,399
especially in data science and research

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,480
where methods and practices are rapidly

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,000
evolving

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,519
and then we have also a group of

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,440
contributors who are translating the

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,360
book into languages to make it truly

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,279
global so more people can read and

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,680
understand them

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,920
we have currently three languages where

00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,880
most of the contributions are happening

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,720
these are spanish chinese and french

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,320
finally we are building a resource

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:50,240
where people are encouraged to share

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,839
best practices it doesn't mean that they

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,760
need to write everything that already

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,760
exists on the internet but they can come

00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,240
and highlight their own resources in the

00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,519
book

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,440
so that others can use them

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,600
the second lesson is to develop

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,240
guidelines because no one can read your

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,240
mind yet

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,160
social norms drive behavior and affect

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,199
community

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,440
culture to avoid any detrimental impact

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,839
of

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,160
unwritten rule we need to transparently

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,160
communicate them with the community

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,079
i think one of the biggest barriers a

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,639
new person can experience when entering

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,279
a project

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,000
is to is not knowing what the rules and

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,880
expectations

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,320
are where they can participate and how

00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,800
they can contribute

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,800
all this can be very discouraging for

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,279
someone who is new to the project

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,000
and that's why documenting them is very

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:42,560
very important

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,839
so define those unlabeled doors tell

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,639
where people can go

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,320
label issues and pull requests describe

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,480
how people can participate

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,240
what tools will be required what kind of

00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,839
support do they have and what kind of

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,839
roles and rewards are in place

00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,199
the minimum requirement for repository

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,040
that even github prompts you to do when

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,519
you go to the insights and the community

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,680
project is to add a readme page

00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,519
define how people can contribute and

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,639
what is the code of conduct

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,240
make it as detailed as possible in the

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,360
touring way we also have a list of

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,639
contributors

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,480
and these are people who have

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,560
contributed and would like to have their

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,399
contributors documented in detail

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,759
we have also carefully developed a

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,720
community handbook

00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,920
this has chapter that describes how to

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,839
enter the project

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,519
we also have guidelines for supporting

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,160
the development of chapters

00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,839
maintaining consistency provide we

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,320
provide chapter templates and workflows

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,160
so nobody has to start from the scratch

00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,759
we describe other community practices

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,519
like how they can meet with each other

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,079
how they can receive reports how they

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,839
can

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,160
get involved in asynchronous uh

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:52,720
collaboration

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,240
and we also have of course github issues

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,959
and bugs that are tagged for

00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,959
new users

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,320
the third lesson is foster a sense of

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,639
ownership

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:05,839
because communities are not built on one

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,839
person's opinion

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,240
we avoid individual authorship in the

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,679
favor of establishing shared ownership

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,760
and agency in the project

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:17,360
the project belongs to the community and

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,360
is always a work in progress

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,199
all our contributions are facilitated

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,640
through github most our conversation

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,559
happens there online

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,720
transparently via issues and pull

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,600
requests all these places for

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,520
us are places to invite people to join

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,520
in and share the discussion

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:37,760
ideas we use all contributors but it's a

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:39,440
very simple to install easy bot

00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,600
but which allows you to recognize

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,919
contributed contributions

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,880
by contributors who don't really push

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,520
code on

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,240
github they might be people who join a

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,240
discussion

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,840
for example this one where martina and

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,799
batu were installing

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,480
a hypothesis web annotation for the book

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,280
but they had had a previous discussion

00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,360
with two people

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,880
laura and samuel and on the way they

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,160
received this support from

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:07,039
you so even though these two are the

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,640
persons who are doing pushes there are

00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,600
three other people who were involved in

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,720
the process

00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,360
who were given the credit for this work

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,760
this is also for me and evidence of

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:21,520
inclusive practices and kind of culture

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,520
we want to develop in the project

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,240
since the during way is an online

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,000
project we want to ensure that people

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,400
have opportunities to meet with each

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
other and build connection we host

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,559
co-working calls every week

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,400
and collaboration cafes bi-weekly we

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,000
also hosted book dash which is a

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,000
sprint-like event so

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
co-working collaboration cafes are

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,240
online quiet co-working time where

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,120
people meet online and work together

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,120
but book dashes are a longer version of

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,720
that where people synchronously from all

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,840
around the world contribute to similar

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,559
topics

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,600
at the same time so the last one we had

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,600
was virtual

00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,679
and honestly that was the most diverse

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,360
and inclusive team that we had because

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,200
of course people could not have attended

00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,600
a lot of in-person events

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,720
so we had ideas and conversation that

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,039
wouldn't have otherwise happened

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,280
martina is one of our core contributors

00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,080
who has been part of the community for a

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,320
long time

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,320
and attends co-working calls and she

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,720
says that it is quite useful for people

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,720
who

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,640
may be intimidated to work in a new

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,240
community with new people

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,919
and these conversations are quite

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,919
crucial for staying motivated

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,360
we also want to create opportunities for

00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,600
people to learn from

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,520
what has happened in the past and this

00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,480
has been also recorded quite

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,080
thoroughly we provide detailed guidance

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,600
to ensure that the best practices are

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,760
maintained throughout the book

00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,840
consistently but we share them with the

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:49,280
caveat that these are recommendation

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,799
and we welcome new approaches of working

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,320
paul was the one who was involved in

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,919
that building

00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,919
of consistency project he was our

00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,440
google season of doc intern and it was

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,960
the first time he was contributing to

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,679
open source

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,400
and he found the experience of working

00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,480
in open source quite rewarding because

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,679
he realized that the work is not in the

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,440
amount of work he does

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,440
but how he enable other people

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,080
the fourth reason uh fourth lesson is

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,679
recognize all contributions

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:22,640
because we want to incentivize

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:25,360
collaboration and promote diversity

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:27,280
we do not recognize if we do not

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,039
recognize all contribution we will end

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,840
up disproportionately ignoring the

00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,000
hidden labor

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,520
that a lot of people do and especially

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,799
those who are quite new to the tech

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,480
community

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,559
often those people are members of

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,640
marginalized group who have historically

00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,880
been excluded from open source and tech

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,480
spaces

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,000
in the turing way we recognize all

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,840
contribution first of all

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,360
as mentioned we use all contributors

00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,520
part that records

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,120
all the contribution directly on pull

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,360
requests and githubs

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,679
but we also provide dedicated page in

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,679
the book for the contributors to write

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:01,679
what they think is meaningful for them

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:06,000
to highlight their work

00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:07,840
they share how they can how

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,120
one person can meet them how they can

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,559
collaborate with them

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,880
and what they have worked on so for

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:15,840
example we have uh batools

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,320
page so everyone gets their dedicated

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,159
link

00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,679
so this can be used for example someone

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:21,200
wants to build a new skill such as

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,600
working with version control

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,520
or building community they can choose to

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,480
work on specific tasks that matches

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,840
their interest

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,000
they can then update their page

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:32,080
describing how they achieve the skill

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,440
which is an evidence for them that can

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,440
become part of their cv

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,559
in order to create opportunities for

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,240
people to come into the project and

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,720
highlight their work we want to meet

00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,320
them

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,000
where they are so

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,919
if you're new to the community join the

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,200
community you can learn a new skill you

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,280
can share a new skill

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,600
you can collaborate with other mentor

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,440
other and represent this community

00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,840
and we will value your participation in

00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,840
any form

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,600
our moonshot goal is to make

00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,200
reproducibility too easy not to do

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,360
and that can happen when we can make

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,280
system and structure level changes

00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,600
influencing research and policy at

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,360
national and international level

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,360
some of the notable impact we had in

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,480
2020 with the support of our

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,480
contributors

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,640
was that the project was highlighted in

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,200
eu report for reproducibility

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,440
a policy by mayor of london on emerging

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,720
technology charter was used

00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:31,600
by was created using the turing way

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,840
as an open inclusive project a funding

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,559
call from ukra reference the project

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,480
as an example of data science culture uh

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,360
community trainings like code refinery

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,200
and data

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,039
and library carpentries have referenced

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,400
the during way and the work has been

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,600
cited in multiple

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,200
papers so let's recap there are four

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,640
lessons that i have shared

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,280
shared so far for culture of

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,880
collaboration design for inclusion

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,480
because inclusion cannot be an

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,559
afterthought

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,320
develop guidelines because we can't read

00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,640
your mind yet

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,720
foster a sense of ownership because

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,640
strong communities are not built on one

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,960
person's opinion

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,880
recognize all contributions because we

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,440
want to incentivize collaboration and

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,000
promote

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,280
diversity there's a lot more to

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,960
community building that i'm not

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,280
discussing today but there is one more

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:22,720
thing that i want to mention

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:24,720
invest in community building

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,640
if you have funding to hire a community

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,600
manager or more community managers

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,840
please do

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,600
if you don't find other ways to reward

00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:33,039
and support volunteers who are doing

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,799
these jobs

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,559
community building is a full-time job

00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,159
and it is important to facilitate a

00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:40,159
culture of collaboration

00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,679
volunteers are often overworked and

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,080
possibly burnt out

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:46,000
we cannot put these hidden and often

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,679
emotional labor on them

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,840
therefore it makes a huge difference to

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,240
have someone working full-time in

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,679
identifying what people's need are how

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,679
we can make it easy for them to

00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,159
participate

00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,919
it is probably a very selfish pitch

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,799
because i enjoy my work as a community

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,520
building

00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,000
and i find it quite valuable in create

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,320
clearing

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,039
hurdle to enable people to do what they

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,679
do best

00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,960
with the skills that they have so to

00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,720
summarize my talk

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:15,120
building a culture of collaboration in a

00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,440
community open source or otherwise

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,799
requires a lot of care and nurturing it

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,120
cannot just happen

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:24,159
we need to be purposeful in integrating

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,240
values we want to build

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,080
with that i'd like to thank all the

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,039
contributors and members of the touring

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,880
way

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,760
thanks to kirsty for starting this

00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:48,400
out to sarah gibson who is

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,320
giving a workshop on binder which is

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,039
free you're welcome to join it's offered

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:56,480
by software sustainability institute

00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,679
i'm happy to take any question thank you

00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,520
yeah i just want to say thank you so

00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,000
much for that presentation it was really

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,679
good

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,120
um i thought there were some really

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,679
interesting points in there i

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,799
i maybe it's uh an obvious one but i

00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,480
just like the

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:13,600
idea of um intentional designing um that

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,039
you know these uh open source projects

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,559
aren't inclusive by default

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,480
and that you know we have to think about

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,039
them from the very beginning and all the

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,320
way through

00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:25,679
i think that's um a very important point

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:28,880
um if anyone has any questions

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:32,080
um please drop them into the chat um

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,320
and i will ask them for you um

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,480
while people are typing i just wanted to

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,080
say that that my talk is online i'll

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,000
drop a link to the pdf

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,919
and i'm sorry i couldn't provide the

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,000
transcription but i have a transcription

00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:48,000
that i will also just share

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,480
in online as a synodo link what advice

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,320
would you give to organizations or

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:55,440
groups

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:57,679
if they can't afford to

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,799
hire someone as a full-time community

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,039
developer or manager

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,400
how would you um advise them to go

00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,919
forward

00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:08,880
i think yeah no it's a it's a great

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:10,720
great question and it's a huge problem

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,000
in most of the communities

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,000
one of the projects that you had

00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,520
mentioned that i'm also part of

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,360
which is open life science where we

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,559
train people how to lead their

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,880
communities and

00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,720
the problem with that training it's

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,880
great but we also have to tell

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,480
our people that volunteer tasks

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,600
shouldn't be always free

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,520
that we need to actually find money to

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,840
support these people but if we can't

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,279
find money i think we can invest in

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,480
their skill building

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:40,400
we need to identify tasks

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,159
which are not really big can we break

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,679
down community building into smaller

00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,760
tasks can we involve

00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,960
10 instead of one person who's probably

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,880
not sleeping well

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,720
doing all these steps so i think just

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,000
bringing those you know human aspect is

00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,120
very important

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,520
that someone is taking responsibility um

00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,600
if the if the projects are running for

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:03,039
free

00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:05,200
i i am quite sad that's the case because

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,240
that's truly the case worldwide but

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,679
there are funding

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,760
uh options that are often available and

00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,039
communicating with the communities for

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,240
example

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:18,240
um sloane moore foundation or bill and

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,399
melinda kate foundation welcome trust

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,440
these are some places where funding can

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,559
be available

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,880
but also apar there's one community it's

00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,880
called

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,480
open bioinformatics foundation we're at

00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,399
the moment trying to launch

00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,559
a grassroot level community support

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:35,200
funding which is not a lot of money

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,679
it gives about one thousand dollars it's

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,399
not

00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,760
a lot but it at least help people with

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,200
infrastructure costs like you know

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,320
having a zoom account or

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,640
setting a communication platform

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,799
so yeah funding is not the answer but i

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,679
do think involving more people in these

00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,720
emotional labor

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,240
is is the answer yeah i guess that um

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,159
fits with um what you were talking about

00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,520
this uh hidden labor as well

00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:02,480
like uh maybe if if the

00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,200
hidden labor is made more visible then

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,640
people can

00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,919
keep an eye on how it's being done and

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,240
who's doing it and making sure it

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,799
doesn't all fall to the same person

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:13,600
absolutely yeah another shout out to

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:16,559
this new project called hidden ref

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,799
hidden ref is a alternative of ref which

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,640
is probably very uk-centric where people

00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,320
recognize a research

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,840
contribution he didn't reference

00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,760
everything behind the research

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,240
contribution

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,480
the the recent addition that they had is

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,000
called lived experience in research

00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,080
where people use people's lived

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,679
experience to build communities

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,679
or project but they don't get

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,039
recognition for all the investment that

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:45,840
they do so i think that's

00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:45,840
something to look out for

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,880
