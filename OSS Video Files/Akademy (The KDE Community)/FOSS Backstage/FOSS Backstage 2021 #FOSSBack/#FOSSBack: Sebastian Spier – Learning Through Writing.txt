thank you

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,639
so yeah this is going to be a light one

00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:10,800
learning through writing

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,480
and i'll use the example of inner source

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,719
patterns and we've heard so much

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,759
about inner source already so just go

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,480
about this

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,439
really briefly again so just what is in

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,800
our source

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,119
is this idea of using open source style

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,920
collaboration approaches but inside of

00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:28,720
your company

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,519
right so at a false conference like like

00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,960
here

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,200
i mean you probably have an idea what

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,000
open source means or you might have

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,920
so using those ideas inside of your

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,120
company with your with your colleagues

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,200
on non-open source projects um

00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,280
so what could inner source patterns be

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,280
done in that context i tried to

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,320
describe that as simply as i could so

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,559
it's really written

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,840
stories about things that have worked

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,960
for other people

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,520
in other contexts and the inner source

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,840
commons

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,600
has collected a bunch of these patterns

00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,680
and i'll just show you how this

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,800
how this looks like so we've published

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,879
the most

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,840
mature patterns as a book and i

00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,080
mentioned these are just

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,320
stories of experiences that people have

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,799
made at various companies of things that

00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,360
work

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,240
for example there's the trusted

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,200
committer

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,720
pattern down here that describes how it

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,960
can be useful

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,119
to establish that concept of a trusted

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,840
committer and to help to give people

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,280
more

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,040
say in a project and

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,400
bring them bring them basically into the

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,320
fold by giving them more

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,000
rights in the community and that type of

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,200
stuff

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,040
so i've said earlier that these patterns

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,799
are just stories but you can already

00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,399
tell here well normally stories don't

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,119
have all these sections

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,119
and subheadings and stuff like that so

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,920
yeah it is a little bit different

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,439
in the patterns because how they work is

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,680
it gives you a predefined

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,200
structure with like the problem what's

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,920
the context that this

00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,840
problem appears in what are the forces

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,960
that are impacting this problem like

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,079
what makes it hard

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,360
to solve it then the solution section

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,000
and what you want the resulting context

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,879
to look like

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,520
like after your solution is in place

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:13,200
right so

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,959
it's not your regular story that you

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,599
would tell to a friend it's a little bit

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,360
more

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,959
it's a little bit more structured but

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,680
something interesting happens there when

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,840
you are

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,879
trying to describe your problem in such

00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,680
a predefined

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,640
structure it can help you think it

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,840
through

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,360
in really beneficial ways so a bit more

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,640
about people that are writing those

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,480
patterns well really

00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,000
anybody can we find that many times

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,160
developers and architects are writing

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,120
them but also product owners or

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,599
designers people working in a program

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,599
office

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,599
like often inner source is located could

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,120
be in the could be the ospo

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,640
office of your company could be a

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,720
dedicated inner source

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,959
office could also be that the company

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,319
doesn't have any office for this type of

00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,080
purpose but it's just

00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,760
maybe it's a guild or it's some type of

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,400
cross-cutting concern in your company

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,200
where people

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,040
are interested in these inner source

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,360
concepts

00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,400
so yeah this talk is about learning from

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,159
writing

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,080
so the question could be well what's in

00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,640
it for me right why should i

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,840
write up a problem that i have at my

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,239
workplace

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,599
as a pattern so one thing that i found

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,239
for myself personally

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,000
just writing things down especially

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,080
trying to get it into a certain

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,159
structure that is predefined

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,640
really helps you to think it through so

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,680
i found it really beneficial to do that

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,599
also when i'm writing in a way that

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,519
the writing that i'm producing is open

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,159
source right so i know that i'm talking

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,799
to people

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,680
outside of my company that means i have

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,239
to

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,840
remove all the jargon and you know like

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,519
things that i take for granted and that

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,799
type of stuff and i have to abstract it

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,879
to a place where

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,439
other people can understand it and again

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:55,120
i find that increases the clarity of

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,560
expression and the clarity of thinking

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,480
quite quite a bit

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,400
so writing things down just for that

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,120
purpose it's already helpful for

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,680
yourself then the other thing is once

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,680
you've

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,439
written it down and you can show it to

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,560
other people i mean just like a blog

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,640
post or

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,159
something else or a video or conference

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,159
talk or anything where you are

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,680
putting your topic out there it allows

00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,320
you to start conversations with other

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,600
people

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,680
all right so for example if i write

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,520
something up like a problem that i have

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,040
and even if i don't have a solution yet

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,440
i can already publish that

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,479
that will allow me to find other people

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,880
that

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,160
might have experienced something similar

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,560
and in the absolute

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,280
best case you find other people with

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,280
that same

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,400
challenge and maybe they've found a

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,400
solution already

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,320
like russ was talking earlier about how

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,120
they are addressing things at nike so

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,800
maybe they've

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,600
figured something out already so maybe

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,080
we can solve it together

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,639
so that's actually all my lightning

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,000
talks

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,160
just a couple of links here that i'll

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,080
share later in the in the chat to the

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,360
veterans book to the slack channel from

00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,840
the inner source commons

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,600
and there's actually even a pattern how

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,600
writing things down

00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,280
can help you with trans transparent

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,039
cross-team decision making so that's

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,479
also kind of related to how writing is

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,560
beneficial

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,360
thank you all here you can find me here

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,360
or later in the

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,840
lounge

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,039
