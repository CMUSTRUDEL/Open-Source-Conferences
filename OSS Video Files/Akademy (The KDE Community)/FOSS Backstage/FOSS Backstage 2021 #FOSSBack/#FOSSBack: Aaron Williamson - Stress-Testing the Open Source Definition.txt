Title: #FOSSBack: Aaron Williamson - Stress-Testing the Open Source Definition
Publication date: 2021-03-01
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	For over 20 years, the Open Source Definition (OSD) has largely defined which licenses are fit for use by collaborative software communities. While there have been many efforts to stretch the definition of open source -- from "source available" to "do no evil" licenses -- incompatibility with the OSD has fatally marginalized most of these efforts. Today, two licensing movements in particular challenge the ascendency of the OSD. On the one hand, startups building SaaS components are moving from open source licenses to more restrictive licenses like the Server-Side Public License (SSPL) to protect their profits from SaaS platform vendors. On the other, the growing ethical source movement seeks to use software licenses as a tool to discourage harmful uses of community-developed software. This talk will discuss the role of the OSD in maintaining license orthodoxy and how these trends test that orthodoxy.

	00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,359
um so

00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,200
originally i was going to talk about a

00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:11,440
pretty boring topic which is

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,280
just sort of like the basics of free and

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,800
open source software licensing but

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,199
uh nina suggested um that maybe i could

00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,439
cover

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,720
uh one of the more controversial uh

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,519
legal topics

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,320
in the community these days which is um

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,720
which is

00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,400
licenses like the commons clause and the

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,760
server side public license

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,399
that uh that are efforts by businesses

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,559
who use

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,600
open source as sort of a business model

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,200
to

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,960
um to essentially exclude

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,040
competition build a moat around their

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,760
businesses etc

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,399
and that sounded uh more interesting to

00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,239
me

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,399
um and so here we are this is going to

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,280
be a little bit of an experimental talk

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,440
because it's not

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,719
um you know i'm a lawyer but i'm not

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,239
going to get too

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,039
deep into the weeds of the licenses or

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,199
the law

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,359
um instead i wanted to take this

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,439
opportunity to

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,000
think about how we should think about

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,760
these licensing trends that are

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,240
sort of ascendant in our community right

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,960
now one being these sort of

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,799
business friendly licenses um that may

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,840
or may not be open source

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,040
um and the other being uh ethical source

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,680
licenses

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,240
um that have cropped up uh repeatedly in

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,680
the last

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,960
several years so uh title of my talk is

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,240
stress testing the open source

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,479
definition

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,159
uh so we're gonna start uh at a pretty

00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,520
basic level which is what is an open

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,520
source license

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,759
there's general agreement that it's any

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,159
license that complies with the open

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,920
source

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,759
definition that's published by the open

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,880
source initiative now of course the free

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,119
software movement

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,560
uh has its own version of this the free

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,320
software definition

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,759
uh generally considered to be

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,880
essentially the same

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:58,159
in its uh in its generalities

00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,119
uh if it's expressed differently um so

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,240
a an open source license is a license

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,119
that complies with the open source

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,200
definition

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,159
now practically it also helps a lot if

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,239
the license is

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,239
certified to comply with the open source

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,920
definition by the open source initiative

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,360
which publishes the open source

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,400
definition

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,959
and maintains a license review process

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,720
for

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,720
determining and certifying whether a

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,239
particular particular license

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,080
is compliant with the open source

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,360
definition

00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,200
so we can say that in reality or in all

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,280
practical reality open source software

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,080
therefore means software that's licensed

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,400
under an open source or an osi approved

00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,760
license

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,640
beyond just complying with the

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,760
definition now open source licenses are

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,000
often referred to

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,519
as the constitutions of open source

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,160
projects

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,000
but in reality in my opinion the open

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,200
source definition is really a lot more

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,200
like a constitution in the national

00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,040
legal structure sense than a license is

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,879
because it's a general statement of

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,879
high-level principles that the more

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:06,319
specific rules found in licenses

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,000
need to conform to um there can be a

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,239
pretty wide variety in the specific

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,080
rules that we have in the licenses

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,599
but the open source definition changes

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,640
very slowly uh

00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,879
by design it doesn't vary much

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,560
from year to year in fact it's only

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,400
changed once in the last 24 years

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,480
now if you've never gotten into the

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,280
weeds of applying the open source

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,040
definition

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:34,560
to open source licenses then it might be

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,480
easy to assume that it's obvious uh how

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,599
the open source definition applies to a

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,680
particular license

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,879
uh but if you have gotten into the weeds

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,360
you know that it's not

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,000
all that easy and that's because the

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,599
open source

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,599
definition is a statement of general

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,840
principles it's meant to state the

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,760
tenets of open source licensing in a

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,680
succinct way but in a way that provides

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,560
room for useful variation between

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,319
licenses

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,000
in the same way that a constitution does

00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,280
with regard to laws it sets out the

00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,120
basic principles

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,879
um you can do anything you want to

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,519
within those principles

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,599
but don't step outside of them so it

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,480
says things like this

00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,040
uh one of its one of its tenets the

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,080
first one

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,880
is free redistribution so an open source

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,239
license uh shall not restrict any party

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,079
from selling or giving away

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,359
software as a component of an aggregate

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,960
software distribution

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,040
containing programs from several

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,320
different sources the license shall not

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,320
require royalty

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,000
or other flat fee for such set or other

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,759
fee for such sale

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,520
so that makes sense to be open source

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,360
your software's license has to permit

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,360
royalty-free redistribution of your

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,080
software uh including in commercial

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,600
products

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,720
a pretty well understood tenant of

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,720
open source licensing

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,560
but you can already see the open source

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,240
definitions sort of beginning to fray

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,000
around the edges with time

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,400
the only software delivery model

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,960
contemplated by this or any other rule

00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,600
is distribution of software software as

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,360
a service

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,600
isn't even a twinkle in the open source

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:09,120
definitions i at the time that it

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:11,360
is adopted first in 1997.

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,360
then you come to a rule like rule six

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,039
which is no discrimination against

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,360
fields of endeavor

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,199
the license may not restrict anyone from

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,199
making a use of a program

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,360
in a specific field of endeavor for

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,120
example it may not restrict the program

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,919
from being used in the business

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,360
or from being used for genetic research

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,759
wow

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,800
what's a field of endeavor seems pretty

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,120
broad

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,639
we know it includes two things business

00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,880
and genetic research

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,160
what else might fit in there you won't

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,120
find the answer in the open source

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,120
definition

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,800
instead like the us constitution the

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,720
answers can only be found in

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,440
sort of the interpretive history of the

00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,680
open source definition

00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,000
and a lot of the raw materials of that

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,840
history can be found in the archives of

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,319
the open source initiatives license

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,280
review mailing list

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,120
this is sort of the case law of open

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,880
source license review if the open source

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,479
definition is the constitution open

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,960
source licenses are the law

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,759
then this is uh the interpretation of

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,120
the

00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:16,479
constitution to the law by judges

00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,160
um and like cases in our legal system

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,759
and i'm going to apologize i realize we

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,360
have a lot of people in europe and

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,080
throughout the world and i'm going to be

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,280
referring

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,880
uh as as a metaphor to the united states

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,880
legal system a lot i hope that you'll

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,759
forgive me for that but it's the one

00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:35,360
that i happen to know and practice in

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:38,560
um but uh again if the

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,440
open source license review list is uh

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,880
the case law

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:45,039
of our licensing system um

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,919
then like cases in our life and our

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,000
legal system

00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,400
uh it evolves as it gets processed

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,639
through successive generations of human

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,800
brains that develop a

00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,240
develop in a changing cultural context

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,720
and come to

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,560
sort of a an evolving understanding of

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,440
what a license means and what it ought

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,880
to mean

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,120
and what the open source definition

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,280
ought to mean uh in the particular

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,639
context that they come up in

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,960
and uh i think it's worth thinking about

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,720
how that context has changed

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,759
uh in the time since the open source

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,560
definition was adopted in 1997

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,560
and today

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,240
but despite the sort of gradual

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,440
evolution and interpretation of the open

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,880
source definition

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,720
the open source definition is a

00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,240
fundamentally conservative

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,919
document again that's by design

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,599
like the constitution it's supposed to

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,880
be resistant to change

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:43,039
as a result of the passions of the age

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,120
and as anyone who's been on the open

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,319
source initiatives license review list

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,160
for a decade will tell you passions

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:53,599
flare from time to time

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,840
in our society as they do in any society

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,520
the same ideas keep coming up over and

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,560
over again as though the community

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,280
develops amnesia every few years which

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,360
makes sense

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,039
new people join the community every day

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,440
and it takes time for them to absorb its

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,440
history

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,960
now this talk is about two ideas that

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,360
have come up before

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:21,680
in the open source license

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:25,199
licensing consideration community

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:28,319
ethical source licenses and licenses

00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,720
in the open source style that attempt to

00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,759
limit

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,759
commercial competition

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:39,120
now as early as 2006 a developer named

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:42,159
titiano mangotti the developer of a

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,760
nutella client you may remember nutella

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,519
as a

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:50,560
free software uh sort of napster type

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:53,519
uh tool um anyway

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,560
the the client was called gpu and this

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,959
developer added a

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,839
so-called asimov license to the project

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,959
license

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:03,920
seeking to prevent military use

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:06,000
by providing that the program and its

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,480
derivative work

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,320
will never be modified or executed to

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,720
harm any human being

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,440
nor through inaction permit any human

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,760
being

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,480
uh to be harmed so this is one of the

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,720
one of the

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,920
laws of robotics from from isaac

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,240
asimov's uh

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,760
universe and and it was applied by this

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,120
developer and has been applied by other

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,720
developers since

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,120
to software uh as as a as a statement to

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,160
to try and prevent uh open source

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,399
software

00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:39,600
uh from being used for for evil

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:42,000
um now then as

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,440
now uh such licenses were deemed

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,680
incompatible with the open source

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,440
definitions rule number six

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:49,120
uh which prohibits discrimination

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,040
against fields of endeavor

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,240
in this case we're talking about the

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:57,600
ancient endeavor of war

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,839
now unsurprisingly uh

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,880
those who have been defending the open

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,000
source definition

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,640
for the last two decades dismiss

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,240
recent efforts as merely history

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,399
repeating itself

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,680
so this is a quote from bruce perrin's

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,240
bruce perrins

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,800
for those of you who are unaware is the

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,880
author

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,000
of the open source definition before

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,480
that he was the author

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,120
of the debian free software guidelines

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,200
which are

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,040
the guidelines that gave rise to the

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,480
open source definition and on which the

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,000
open source definition was

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:33,040
very closely based so bruce was the

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,240
debian project leader back in the

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,680
mid 90s um at least and

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,279
uh came up with the debbie and free

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,800
software guides as a sort of statement

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,760
of principles to

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,560
say what what was uh appropriate for

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,680
inclusion

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,519
in uh debian uh

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,720
the debian distribution and what was

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,640
inappropriate

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,160
um and so then he went off and formed

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,320
the open source initiative

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,079
uh as a way of sort of evangelizing the

00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,640
concept of open source in a more

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,560
business-friendly context uh and adapted

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,640
the debian free software guidelines to

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:07,519
be the open source definition

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,640
um that was the basis for uh the open

00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,560
source initiatives

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,560
determinations of which licenses were

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,760
open source or not

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,880
so uh what he said about the recent

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,160
movement toward

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:22,000
more ethical licenses is this

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,079
uh more recently there's been a spate of

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,839
ethical licenses which require specific

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,360
conduct of the software user

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,360
although although there has been a

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,880
regular stream of such things suggested

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,160
to the open source initiative over the

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,040
past 20 years

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,839
the most recent crop includes the

00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,920
anti-996 license

00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,440
which requires the licensee not commit

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,959
labor abuses which are said to be

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,360
rampant in china

00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,800
the vaccine license which requires users

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,959
to get their shots

00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,079
and the hippocratic license which

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,320
prohibits use

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,519
abuses against uh underprivileged

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,800
minorities

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:57,279
uh and so he made these comments in a

00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,079
in a blog post and goes on to say

00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:00,560
essentially

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,880
we've seen all of this before we've had

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:05,600
developers try to put ethical use

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,079
clauses into open source licenses before

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,920
and we've known for a long time that

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,760
these clauses violate the open source

00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,440
definition and shouldn't be included in

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,800
open source licenses

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,399
because uh well that's what we decided

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,279
and it's bad for open source

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,399
and uh it makes it more difficult to

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,600
sort of establish

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,920
the commons of software for common use

00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,680
that

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,600
we were trying to when we set up the

00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:32,959
concept of of open source

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,720
in the first place so no surprise that

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,240
those who have been around since the

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,399
early days of open source and helped

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,440
shape what the open source definition

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,639
is are resistant to

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,839
recent efforts to uh to sort of

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:50,800
push on the definition of open source

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,800
whether it's from the ethical source

00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,600
side or from the sort of business

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,320
friendly

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,320
license side

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,079
now likewise

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,720
just with just as with ethical source

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:09,120
licenses licenses that

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,040
limit competition in one way or another

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,480
have also been around as long

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,920
as open source has been around um so to

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,279
give a couple of examples

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:22,079
um the sun community source license

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:23,920
which was previously applied to java

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:28,079
back before it was made open source

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:31,279
in certain respects under the gpl v2

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,959
with the glass path exception the sun

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,480
community source license gave open

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,560
source like permissions

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,079
but required modified versions for

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,839
example of java

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,680
to remain compatible with sun's

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,079
specifications

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,480
so they were preventing essentially a

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,000
competing or fractured java ecosystem

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,839
with that license

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,639
again not considered open source at the

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,639
time though shared a lot in common with

00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,480
open source and borrowed a lot from from

00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,480
open source licenses

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,240
uh and then there was microsoft's shared

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,079
source initiative which received a

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,680
whole lot of negative attention from the

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,639
open source community back

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,320
uh in the day so this was around 2001

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,360
when it was introduced

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:12,560
um and that initiative permitted a range

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,480
of activities

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,000
uh depending on the nature of the

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,079
licensee's use

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,120
um so depending on whether it was

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,880
academic or non-profit etc

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,880
and how likely that use was to compete

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:27,920
with microsoft's business

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,959
so the concept of

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,600
uh you know using an open source like

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,120
license

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:38,320
to restrict uh competition um

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,839
or sort of other businesses from getting

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,880
too close to the core business of the

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,680
licensor

00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,240
uh is is something that's been around

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,600
since

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:51,440
open source has been around um

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:54,800
and uh so

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,959
these licenses are um considered like

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,079
ethical source licenses to violate open

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,880
source rule number

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,800
six because they discriminate against

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,120
certain commercial uses of the software

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,160
which

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:10,639
are fields of endeavor like business or

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:14,800
like war or like genetic research

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:17,600
um so uh

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,120
this includes recent efforts um such as

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,360
the commons clause

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,880
uh which plainly prohibits selling the

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,279
license software

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,959
um and the elastic license which is

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,279
which is excerpted here

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,160
which prohibits providing managed

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,120
services

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,320
around software so the elastic license

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,839
specifically says

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,759
you may not provide the software to

00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,639
third parties as a hosted or managed

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,320
service

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,000
where the service provides users with

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,399
access to any substantial set

00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,440
of the features or functionality of the

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,440
software

00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,720
and so in in theory the idea behind this

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,040
particular license

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,480
is to address you know what's commonly

00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,920
reported as a problem

00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,639
among uh software vendors that

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,839
uh produce software for sort of cloud

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,959
services

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:07,519
um that you know large uh cloud platform

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,920
providers like amazon can come along

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,120
you know use their immense resources to

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,680
offer their

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,959
uh to offer these open source services

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,480
in this case for example

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:22,480
elasticsearch or cabana uh as a service

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,720
um and and effectively undercut

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,000
one of the potential business models for

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,240
a company that wants to

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,680
make it software open source but also

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,320
develop a business model around the

00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:34,240
software

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,440
so in this case um you know the licensor

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,839
wanted to

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,120
offer managed services itself but feels

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,839
that it's diffic too difficult to

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,959
compete with

00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,160
someone like amazon who offers managed

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,959
services at such

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,000
an immense scale that that a startup uh

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,199
has a difficult time

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,800
competing with them um

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:58,160
now the licenses like this

00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:00,000
are uh quite clearly uh

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,079
in violation of the open source

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,079
definition at least as it's been

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,559
sort of classically interpreted that if

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:09,199
you're if you're excluding a particular

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,120
type of use of the software uh in a

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,480
relatively clear way then you are

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,839
discriminating against a field of

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,160
endeavor um so there's really no

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,600
there's there's never been any argument

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,760
including from the people who develop

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,679
these licenses that the commons clause

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,360
or the elastic license are open source

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,360
licenses they are meant to be

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,200
open source like licenses that give you

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,160
a lot of the same flexibility to sort of

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,480
adopt

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,080
adopt the software uh for your own

00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,200
business needs so long as you're not

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,120
competing

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,960
um but uh but not to give you

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,240
um all of the freedoms that an open

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,679
source software license

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:49,440
uh would give you um now

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,320
they succeed or fail you know sort of to

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,760
questionable and

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:56,799
in varying degrees uh along you know

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,120
along um their stated purpose which is

00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,960
to

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:01,440
permit everything except for competing

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,240
with uh with the original licensor

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,120
um some of some of these licenses i've

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,720
found

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,320
difficult to uh to interpret on behalf

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,640
of my clients who

00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,360
really aren't anywhere like an amazon

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,600
but

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,559
the terms of the license are often quite

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,120
quite vague

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,559
uh you know intentionally and so it's

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,000
you know there's there's a broader set

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:23,760
of things where you where you need to go

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,559
back to the original license or to ask

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,320
about if you

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,080
if you're serious about using their

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,600
software in a more sort of open source

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:34,160
way um but

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,320
whereas uh whereas licenses like the

00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,760
commons clause or the elastic license

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:41,520
are um sort of obviously and

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,440
intentionally not conformant to the open

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,039
source definition others have been a

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,080
closer call

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,120
so mongodb developed its server-side

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,360
public license

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,400
um with the help of an experienced open

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,559
source attorney

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,720
and with the goal of it being an open

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,520
source compliant open source definition

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,039
compliant

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,400
open source license um so they based the

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,600
license on

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:08,000
uh the afero gpl version three um

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,400
and and you know very intentionally i

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,480
think only changed a single

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,840
a single section of that license which

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,840
is the section on

00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,880
you know interaction with other network

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,480
services

00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:23,280
uh section 13. and

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,000
rather than competing sorry rather than

00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,400
prohibiting

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,120
competing or commercial uses in the same

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,320
way that the

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:32,320
commons clause or the elastic license do

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,320
it took the same basic approach as

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:38,400
strong copy left licenses like the

00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:40,480
agpl on which it was based so to require

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,120
the licensees of the software to make

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,200
enough of their own software open source

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,039
that they can't lock down competitive

00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,640
modifications and therefore

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,320
you know it basically makes it a lot

00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,240
harder for someone else to compete with

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,400
you but it does it by saying

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,640
you know by by essentially having a

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,840
reciprocity or share alike or copy left

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,600
requirement

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:05,120
now uh that copyleft requirement goes

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,559
much further than uh the gpl's copyleft

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,159
requirement and that's really been the

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,640
source of the controversy for the

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:14,000
server-side public license

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,480
in addition to sort of para osd

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,159
concerns the server-side public license

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,159
really didn't fare well

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,600
in the open source initiatives license

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:23,520
review process

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,799
um but many of the criticisms were

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,960
rooted sort of only

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,559
loosely in the open source definition

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,039
many commentators were clearly

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:33,039
suspicious of mongodb's motives and

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:34,000
accused them of using the open source

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,760
initiative to rubber

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,440
stamp a sort of bait and switch

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,280
licensing strategy

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,360
rather than sort of in good faith

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,000
putting forward an open source license

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,520
for

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,000
others to use um so

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,120
i think the most cogent open source

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,960
definition based

00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:55,280
argument uh related to the

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,280
um

00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,600
related to the server-side public

00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,640
license was that it

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,320
it violated rule number nine of the open

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,640
source definition which is

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,919
that the license must not restrict other

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,360
software

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,440
and i apologize i think i got a little

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,080
lazy with my slides here and so i don't

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,280
have rule number nine up but

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,280
rule number nine of the open source

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,200
definition provides that a license may

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,840
not restrict other software

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,679
um with which it's distributed we looked

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:27,360
at it a little earlier

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:29,039
um and that's because the server-side

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,440
public license requires

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,720
licensees to open source software that

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,280
wasn't based on

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,559
the license software itself so that

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:39,679
would include

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:41,520
management software uh user interfaces

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,720
application program interfaces

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,720
automation software

00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,039
monitoring software backup software

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,600
storage software and hosting software

00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:51,679
uh the idea being basically if you're

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,960
amazon and you want to

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,159
offer uh mongodb as a service then you

00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,559
have to open source

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,240
everything that makes it possible for

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,960
you to deliver that service to your

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,200
customers

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,159
at scale and therefore to eliminate

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,960
whatever

00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,400
competitive advantage that you have at

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,919
least based on sort of

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,520
you know what you've built in that

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:16,000
superstructure around the software

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,799
over over the developers of mongodb

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,480
which is to say

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:24,240
mongodb now

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:26,480
this argument itself that that

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,000
this provision of the server-side public

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,039
license violated

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,960
um the open source definition has its

00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:36,159
own problems it's not as clear-cut

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,039
as the argument against ethical uh

00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,320
ethical source licenses um you know and

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:43,120
the first reason for this

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,039
is that as bruce parents himself

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,080
recognized on the open source

00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:50,799
initiative license review list uh

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:51,760
the uh the argument doesn't really line

00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,080
up all that well

00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,360
with rule number nine of the open source

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,799
definition

00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,679
um so that definition says that the

00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,440
license may not

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,039
place restrictions on other software

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,000
that is distributed along with the

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,000
license software

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,320
for example the license must not insist

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,720
that all other programs distributed on

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,720
the same medium must be open source

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,640
but as he goes on to say since software

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,640
as a service is not distributed

00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,159
open source definition number rule

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:23,280
number nine doesn't

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,760
apply um by its literal terms to use

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,760
like

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,799
uh mongodbs and the server-side public

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,559
license

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,559
sorry he says the document was written

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,840
for another time and i couldn't predict

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:33,679
today's conditions

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,280
he goes on in a later message to say

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,400
that he didn't even have a lawyer to

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,679
help him

00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:42,640
um and so uh

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,679
and so here again we see that you know

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,400
there is this sort of

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,880
common community understanding that that

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,760
uh

00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,799
came out on the osi mailing list about

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,360
this license

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,320
that was in violation of of rule nine or

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,799
that at least

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,919
it in some way violated the open source

00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,960
definition

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:02,799
um but uh but it's actually a little bit

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,000
of a poor fit in part because the open

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,559
source definitions

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,320
uh language has you know is is so

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,799
limited to the context

00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,840
of distribution but there's another

00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,000
reason why

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,600
this argument is a little bit of a poor

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,159
fit against the server-side public

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,559
license

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:19,679
being an open source license and that's

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,600
that

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,760
historically the open source initiative

00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,120
hasn't held the clearest line when it

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,360
comes to applying

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,480
rule nine at least in my opinion so for

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,279
example uh

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,600
gpl version two has long required

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,039
licensees to provide not only the source

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,360
code for the software

00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,559
itself that's licensed under the under

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,960
the license

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,880
but also the scripts used to control

00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,679
compilation and installation of the

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,200
executable now as in the case of the

00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,480
laundry list of things that

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,000
the sspl requires you to provide um

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,600
scripts used to control compilation and

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,520
installation of the executable are not

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,360
actually the software itself

00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,480
they're not a derivative work of the

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:03,760
software they are software that is

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:07,520
used to sort of um deploy the software

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:09,520
to sort of put it into practical effect

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,880
in in the specific context where you're

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,200
using it

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,120
so you know the osi has in the past

00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,720
approved licenses that sort of reach

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,240
beyond the software itself

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,960
to um to other things that that help you

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,320
to

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,159
deploy it in a particular instance and

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,360
it's not really clear where the line is

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,240
between what gpl

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,159
v2 does which is you know only reaching

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,840
a little further to these scripts and

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,640
maybe scripts are considered sort of

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,039
less

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,799
uh substantial than than the types of

00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,679
things that the sspl was trying to

00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,200
require

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,240
but again the line is just not that

00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,960
clear and likewise gplv3

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,600
required that you know in addition to

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,880
all of

00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,480
the things that gplb2 required um

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,159
the software that comes in embedded

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,120
devices uh or

00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:59,200
consumer electronics devices um include

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:00,559
any installation information required to

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,720
install modified versions of the

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:04,559
software back into the device and so

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,360
again you could you could read that as a

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:09,600
restriction on a field of endeavor

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,640
as in the delivery of sort of locked

00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,600
down

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,279
consumer electronics devices you could

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,880
read it as a restriction on the other

00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,480
software on the device including the

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,760
software that controls

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,960
access to the device's internal software

00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:26,080
and memory

00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,840
um but uh both versions of the gpl

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,960
have of course long been considered

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,919
compliant with the open source

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,720
definition

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,559
whereas the sspl which sort of like

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,679
stretches these same types of

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,880
requirements

00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:42,400
was pretty roundly rejected

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,760
and all of this is just to say that um

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,440
you know which i think is the obvious

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,120
that the open source application open

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,320
source initiatives application of the

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,320
open source definition is uh to

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,919
particular licenses is necessarily

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:56,080
political process

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,440
as in court where there's ambiguity in

00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,919
the constitution and the law

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,520
the political bias of the judges or just

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,080
the people on the open source initiative

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,000
mailing list can determine the outcome

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,919
and this isn't an inherently bad or

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,919
wrong thing it's a trade-off between

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,840
certainty and adaptability

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,559
in the open source definition and our

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,960
systems of law make the same trade-offs

00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,399
um open source initiatives license

00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,240
review committee is basically a

00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,679
conservative institution applying

00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,279
established rules

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,600
periodically to new cases and

00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:27,840
intentionally avoiding innovation

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,520
and as in a constitutional democracy

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,799
fundamental changes are supposed to be

00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:33,039
really difficult to make

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,880
and they happen slowly and so when they

00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,960
do occur it's typically the result of

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,600
social change that sort of builds slowly

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,320
or almost

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:43,360
imperceptibly over time until suddenly

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,360
the need for change is undeniable

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,640
and those changes can sneak up on you

00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,880
and i you know again i'm

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,399
i'm going to apologize for giving a very

00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,440
u.s centered

00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:54,080
metaphor here but in the u.s the first

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,799
cage

00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,399
the first court case challenging laws

00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:01,600
prohibiting gay marriage

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:05,039
uh was brought in 1970 um

00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,799
as late as 1996 a democratic u.s

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:09,200
president signed a federal law

00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,240
defending traditional marriage by

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,279
defining it as

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,600
between one man and one woman in 1998

00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:17,120
two states approved state constitutional

00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,240
amendments making gay marriage

00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,039
unconstitutional

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,600
so in the late 90s there was like this

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,000
sort of

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,200
wall against this concept that gay

00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,799
marriage is something that

00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:32,000
that that the state should permit

00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:34,000
and then in 2003 massachusetts became

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,880
the first state to explicitly permit gay

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,760
marriage

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,480
and then nearly half of the states in

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,000
the u.s

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,840
followed over the course of just the

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,039
next decade so from

00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:48,799
you know 1970 to 2003

00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:51,200
no action and then from 2004 to 2014

00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,159
suddenly half the country is on board

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,039
with this

00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,080
um and in 2015 the u.s supreme court

00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,720
ruled gay marriage

00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,480
bans unconstitutional nationwide and i

00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,080
don't mean to say that acceptance of

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,240
ethical source licenses

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,000
much less business source licenses are

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,919
as important as the legalization of gay

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,159
marriage in the united states

00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,159
or even that they're inevitable only

00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,679
that the recurrence of an idea

00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:15,760
over the course of time doesn't

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,760
necessarily mean that it's tired or worn

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,520
out or wrong

00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,200
sometimes it only means that it's

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,679
building steam

00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,600
and while the triumph of gay marriage is

00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,960
perhaps a less compelling metaphor for

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,480
the struggle of adoption of business

00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,480
friendly licenses in particular

00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,760
the struggle of those licenses may be

00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:39,360
bound up inextricably with the evolution

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:41,039
of copyleft licenses more generally

00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,480
it was the progressive wing of our

00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,080
movement richard stallman's free

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,120
software foundation that raised the

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,279
alarm about the

00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:49,120
sort of application service provider

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:51,279
loophole to begin with

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,799
that banner that's now being taken up by

00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,960
companies like mongodb

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:57,120
and elastic from a very different

00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:00,159
perspective instead of incentives

00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,520
um but the solution to that problem the

00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,120
affair of gpl

00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,880
never really had the impact on server

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,399
side software that the gpl did on the

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,480
previous paradigm

00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,919
and its model of software deployment may

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:13,360
be as outdated

00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:15,440
now as the gpl v2s was in 2007 when the

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,840
affair gpl was adopted

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,000
as the pace of technology technological

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,760
development continues to increase

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,399
so while it's understandable that the

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,559
osi would see a license like the sspl

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:28,240
as a cynical attempt to co-opt open

00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,720
source for business advantage

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,640
it'll eventually have to reckon i think

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,159
with a competent next-generation

00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,640
copyleft license

00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,200
genuinely aimed at increasing software

00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,520
freedom

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,000
or human freedom and that license may

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,399
look a lot more like the sspl

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,120
than it does like the agpl and if

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:47,039
licenses

00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,799
are going to remain an effective tool

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,480
for enforcing community values and

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:53,279
bringing software freedom

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,960
in this new age of distributed online

00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:58,960
network services

00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:02,320
than something is going to have to give

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,320
thank you that's my presentation

00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,960
i understand that maybe i'll be thrown

00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:10,640
into a room for

00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:13,840
questions now hi thank you so much aaron

00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:16,080
yes uh so many interesting topics and

00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,080
i have some questions myself but i would

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,200
like first to encourage you to post your

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,000
questions

00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,720
in the chat in prinzlowerberg in

00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,880
streamyard or sorry in venulis

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,320
any questions you can either post them

00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,039
as a chat directly or

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,679
in the questions tab which is next to

00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:35,360
the the chat top right

00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,799
in the meantime i will ask you a

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,279
question aaron because i don't see any

00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,000
questions

00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:41,120
there just yet uh so you said that the

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,360
agpl3

00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:45,360
may be outdated for the needs of uh

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,760
recent companies and market activity

00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,640
i think that's a fascinating concept and

00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,559
so

00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,399
does that mean that you do see merit and

00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:54,559
justification in

00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,840
some of these additional restrictions on

00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,840
on freedom that you described from

00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,320
mongodb in elastic do you

00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,919
do you see that they i mean you

00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,120
fundamentally agree with those companies

00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,799
that restricting

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,159
the freedoms that we're used to could be

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,240
necessary to preserve

00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,080
freedom in the current commercial

00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,279
context

00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,000
well um i i'm going to reserve judgment

00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:17,120
on that exact

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,919
question um but what what i you know

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,880
there's there's

00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,760
always been this tension in in free and

00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,760
open source like

00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,880
software licensing between you know

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,799
restriction and

00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,799
and freedom right and different concepts

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:31,919
of freedom so you know if you are

00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:34,640
if you are sort of more uh on the

00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:36,320
i if you're if you're more concerned

00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,679
with the freedom of developers

00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,440
then you might lean more toward uh

00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,159
highly permissive open source licenses

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,640
because in in one sense those grant

00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:47,440
more freedoms than a copyleft license

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,840
whereas

00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,000
if you are concerned with ensuring your

00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,360
software is never used to restrict

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,519
another person's freedom

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,240
then you may lean more toward a copy

00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:01,919
left license and so my point isn't that

00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,840
i agree with these companies

00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,279
and their particular restrictions it's

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,919
more that if you

00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:09,600
if you believe that copyleft licensing

00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:13,039
has a place in the sort of

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:16,399
new software paradigm then necessarily

00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:19,120
it's going to get more restrictive um

00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:20,000
than existing copyleft licenses in the

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,960
same way

00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,480
that uh the server-side public license

00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,640
got more restrictive and

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,000
and you might be able to find a more

00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,880
clever way to do it and there are in

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,679
fact several

00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,960
i think efforts to think about what the

00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,039
future of copyleft

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,159
looks like in our community um

00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,799
copyleftconf

00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,240
um was started by the software freedom

00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,399
conservancy to consider

00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,000
sort of you know what the future of of

00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:46,159
copyleft ought to look like

00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,120
um i know a few people who have taken a

00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,240
stab

00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:53,200
uh at drafting sort of model

00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,320
model copyleft licenses for for a new

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,200
era including

00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:59,919
um richard fontana who who's at red hat

00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,519
and a lawyer named kyle mitchell

00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,120
um and so these are these are all

00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:06,480
interesting efforts

00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:08,240
um but eventually you know

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,320
the i think the uncomfortable truth for

00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:14,079
the for copyleft proponents

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:16,240
is that uh is that

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,119
you know their their interests are bound

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,879
up

00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,560
more with the interests of these

00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,760
companies who they tend to be highly

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,639
suspicious of than

00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,639
than maybe they think

00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,159
interesting so you potentially see that

00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,639
freedoms will necessarily be more

00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,919
restricted in future then

00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,480
um i i think it will be one strategy um

00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:37,919
for

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:40,399
for software freedom proponents uh for

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:41,359
for attempting to sort of secure the

00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:43,679
freedoms of

00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,639
of uh free and open source software

00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,919
licenses

00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:49,599
in in the cloud environment thank you

00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,359
and we have a question from uh

00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,960
jan vildeboa who some of us will be

00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,200
familiar with about the

00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,399
interpretation of the sspl by

00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,320
distributions

00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,400
uh he says that red hat made the

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,720
decision that it was not compatible

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,599
for them to distribute software under

00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,680
that license

00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,960
and he asks about uh whether other

00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,320
distributions

00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,400
necessarily need to take the same

00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,720
approach do you have an opinion on this

00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,079
about the compatibility of sspl with

00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,599
distribution models

00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,800
through software repositories and by

00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:20,960
existing open source linux distributions

00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,240
uh i mean what i would say about that is

00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,920
you know it sort of goes back to the

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,560
point i made at the beginning of this

00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,680
uh of this talk which is there are two

00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,400
ways to think about

00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,599
uh what the open source uh what an open

00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,320
source license is

00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,160
one is uh that it is a license that

00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,920
conforms the open source definition

00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:40,079
in which case you can make your own

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,079
determination about whether

00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:43,440
a particular license complies regardless

00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,920
of whether the open source initiative

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,720
has weighed in

00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,560
on it and one is that it's an open

00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,800
source license that has been

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:53,119
uh approved by the osi as conformant

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,760
with the open source definition now

00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,640
the open source initiative took the uh

00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,440
took the i think

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:01,200
unusual step um in response to the

00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,040
server-side public license of

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,520
publishing a blog post signed by the

00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,920
open source initiatives board saying

00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,760
um even though it was withdrawn from the

00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,599
license review process

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,119
that the server-side public license was

00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,680
not an open source

00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,400
license now notably i don't think they

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,359
really gave

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,680
much of a justification under the under

00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,520
the

00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,599
sort of specific terms of the open

00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:26,079
source definition for why that is

00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,520
um certainly the licensed stewards uh

00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,320
mongodb

00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:32,320
continued to you know assert that it was

00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:34,880
a valid open source license even

00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,720
after it was withdrawn um just sort of

00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,680
saw the writing on the wall

00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,960
um so i think certainly you know

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,680
distributions can make their own

00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,880
decisions

00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,680
um about this but they they they face

00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,560
their own

00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,839
uh sort of internal processes internal

00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,599
politics around

00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:53,119
around you know what ought to be

00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,960
considered an open source

00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:59,760
license and so you know i think

00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,720
it probably will be an uphill battle um

00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,400
but

00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,079
but of course you know anybody's allowed

00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,839
to interpret the open source definition

00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,920
as they please and ultimately it's going

00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:10,480
to be the downstream users who have to

00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,920
decide whether

00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,240
whether it's an appropriate license for

00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:23,839
their use

00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:23,839
thank you very much

00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,119
