Title: #FOSSBack: Monica Sarbu - Managing distributed teams from your pyjamas
Publication date: 2021-02-25
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Almost any open-source project of a certain size is powered by a globally distributed team. Different contributors from different parts of the globe have a similar interest and gather virtually to work on it, often in their free time. Many people underestimate the potential of building a valuable product this way, but today no one can ignore the incredible impact that open-source had on our technological progress. There are thousands of open-source projects that have anywhere from one to thousands of contributors. Each of them has a leader or some sort of steering committee and most of them work in a fairly similar way. If you think about it, this is by far the most successful model of software development.
There are many ideas that can be taken from the “open source way” of building a product that you can apply to manage any type of distributed team working on any type of project. The open-source model has shown us that we can work efficiently in an async way, across multiple timezones, that allows people to combine their personal life with building successful products. 

Monica will share her experiences in building and leading several globally distributed teams of paid engineers working on open source projects.  She gained her experience on building an open-source project and a community around it by starting Packetbeat, which was acquired by Elastic. Packetbeat was the starting point of the Beats project, which is one of the most downloaded products of Elastic with over 100M downloads. Her experience continues with leading the team that develops and maintains Logstash, another very popular open-source project.

One of the things she learned during her experience is the value of 1:1 mentorship relationships and how they can be a powerful tool for encouraging and growing diverse talent. After leaving Elastic, she founded Tupu.io, a non-profit initiative that offers free mentorship for women and underrepresented groups in tech. This presentation will include the learnings from creating and running this mentorship platform.

The talk will have the following structure:

  + The open-source development model

      - Constraints: multiple locations, multiple timezones, reduced hours

      - Characteristics: async communication, PRs, code reviews

       - Benefits: scalability, sense of accomplishment, leadership

       - Concerns: inclusion, lack of professionalism 

   + The open-source development model for teams:

       - Autonomy, flexible working schedule

       - Favor async communication, but still take advantage of the technology

        - How can you still do performance management? Don’t count PRs

     + Mentorship

        - The value of mentorship for increasing diversity and inclusivity

        - The mission of tupu.io and how you can help as well

	00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,559
today i'm going to talk about

00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,320
managing distributed themes from your

00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,599
pajamas

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,640
um so a bit about myself uh

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:20,160
in the last six years i was leading

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,800
everybody teams at elastic

00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,760
which is the company behind the open

00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,199
source project

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,840
elasticsearch kibana beats logstash

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,560
and also giants farm and starting with

00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,239
last year

00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:38,239
i started two new companies

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:41,920
and one of them exata exeter

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:45,440
is offering servers

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,559
database for gemstack applications

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,480
and also tupo which is a non-profit

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,920
organization

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:57,520
to help that offers

00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,559
free mentorship for non-representative

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,920
people in tech um okay

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:06,320
so let's start with uh how

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,240
explaining a bit about these three types

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,200
of engineering teams

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,960
so the first is the classical one uh the

00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,240
onside where basically

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:19,439
everyone is working from an office uh

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:23,759
then remote basically when

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:28,159
people or when the company starts to

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,439
hire people um are working remotely in

00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,960
addition to the

00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:33,600
to the people that are working in an

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,360
office so basically it's a mixture

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,439
and the third type is a team that is

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,640
fully distributed people are working

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,200
from home

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,799
particularly very similar with what we

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,320
are experiencing now

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:51,119
in this pandemic times um

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,920
a few years ago many people had doubts

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,600
about the productivity of a fully

00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,280
distributed team

00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,759
um and though you know there are so many

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,680
successful open source projects that

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,880
kind of prove that

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,080
you can build a successful

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,640
product with people uh

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,200
spread around the world and you know

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,319
there are

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,720
such great examples like linux kernel uh

00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:23,920
firefox ubuntu mysql kubernetes and this

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:27,120
is just a few of those right um

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,640
and also there are many companies that

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,239
kind of took this model

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:34,000
of an open source um model and they were

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,560
fully distributed from

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,920
and here also you you can see a few

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,760
examples

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,480
uh like elastic sketch uh of zero

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,760
gitlab stack overflow and many many

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,959
others

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:52,959
um but then you know corona uh came

00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:55,200
and and basically people were forced to

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,720
work from home uh during this mundane

00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,000
times and

00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:03,440
many companies struggled there because

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,720
overnight they had to change

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:10,000
their style of working from an

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:13,519
office culture to a kind of a

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,120
distributed culture right and this is

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,920
this is challenging because you know

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,040
both they have nothing in common so you

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,280
have to

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,519
everything everything more or less from

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,400
scratch how you are working with your

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,799
team

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,159
and how you are becoming productive and

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,440
things like this

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:36,080
so that's why i want to talk today about

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,560
the distributed world model and let's

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,319
start

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,959
with some advantages so what advantages

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,879
you as an

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:47,519
employee of a distributed company have

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,560
and uh first one is that you are working

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,599
from home

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,080
um so you you don't have to commute to

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,720
work

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,120
and maybe for hopefully for many of you

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,840
this is not a problem because

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,080
you probably have to have you have a

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,599
short commute time to work

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,200
but for many people there especially

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,560
people in us

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:14,239
where they have to uh go to work uh

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,359
of one hour and then come another hour

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,160
so they will basically save two hours of

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:20,479
their life

00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,560
and work on something else that makes

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:26,720
them happy

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:29,680
so flexible schedule is also another um

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,759
advantage basically you are not forced

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:36,479
to do the entire work in a in a big slot

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,840
you know the traditional nine to five

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,280
you are able to

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:44,880
um to plan your day

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:48,400
um as you want and

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,919
so and and also to have time to do

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,280
something else uh

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:57,040
in between um so this also life

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,320
allows you to have a better work life

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,840
balance

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,039
um which is kind of is a big advantage

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,320
in my opinion

00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:09,600
because it allows you to uh

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:13,360
to do other things that you know

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:17,360
makes you um fulfilled

00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:20,639
in one sense so you can for example um

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,639
you know go to the doctor whenever you

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,919
want in the middle of the day

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:29,120
you can uh go and attend

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,240
a sport event of your kid you can take

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,840
your kids uh

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,840
early uh for school uh without

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,240
you know feeling guilty that you are

00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,280
leaving uh the office at 3 p.m

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,880
and things like this right and in the

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,360
end i think this is what

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,280
makes them makes people happy right

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,039
being able to

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:55,520
to do what you like and also

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:59,520
um you know you don't have to

00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:03,039
uh sacrifice some personal

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:06,160
um projects if you want

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,479
in order to be able to have a career

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,000
i think this is what makes most of the

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,319
people happy

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,680
um so that's in my opinion that's a big

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,800
advantage

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:20,080
and you know no need to relocate so

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,280
in a traditional way you're probably

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,080
you've seen an uh job offer uh in in a

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,479
big city

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,319
so if you're living in a small in a

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:32,639
small village for example

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,520
you had to move and to a big city in

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,840
order to have

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,880
a particular job but with this model

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,479
basically

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:43,440
you can have your desired career

00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,840
without you know moving the place that

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,520
you

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:50,000
love to to to to leave

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,560
um so let's see also you know we've seen

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,880
a lot of advantages what people

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,680
from you know from your advantages but

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,080
let's see

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,240
what are the company advantages so i

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,360
think in my opinion you know

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,560
being having happy employees uh

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:08,720
this will make them like unlikely to

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,479
leave the company

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,720
because you know they are happy they

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:16,240
want to continue working

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,880
for this amazing company and this will

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,000
also

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,880
make people more motivated right because

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,960
they want to

00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:28,800
um they want to put their efforts

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:31,120
um more effort in making the product

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,680
that they are building more success

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,639
because they really believe and they

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,199
really want

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,120
the companies to be successful in order

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,319
not to lose these benefits

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,840
right and there were some studies

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:49,199
and here there was a survey uh made by

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:52,960
kosovo cloud in 2015

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:55,039
that show that this district model also

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,080
increased productivity

00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:01,360
and there are so many um

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:04,560
you know things that you can reach

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,000
to kind of prove that a distributed

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,800
model increased

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,080
increases productivity which people kind

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,120
of had doubts

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,160
um you know for a lot of time and in

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,479
this survey

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,919
um 23 people percentage of people that

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,879
were interviewed

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,919
say that they are willing to work uh for

00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,360
longer hours

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,599
to get more done um there are 52

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,680
but they said that they're less likely

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,479
to take time off

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,599
uh 30 percent of those have accomp they

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,479
are accomplishing

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:40,959
more in less time and what is

00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:44,080
interesting is that 77

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:47,920
of those they have

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:51,120
uh um you know unimproved productivity

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,120
while working from home

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,000
another big advantage for a company is

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,120
that you can hire the best

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,120
talent across the region across a

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,040
continent or across

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:09,839
uh even the globe right so you are not

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,839
restricted to um to

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:17,519
um to a city right

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:22,080
so with this you can basically

00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:25,120
have more better qualified people

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,519
right in your company um

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,760
and then i mean if you are building you

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:33,040
know a company that

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:36,080
uh so you need to have uh support

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,120
coverage you know being distributed

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,279
helps you right you uh you

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,959
if you want to cover another time zone

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:45,920
you hire another person in

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,320
that another time zone you don't have to

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,440
find

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,680
ways how to um

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,720
you know put people work in different

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,160
shifts uh

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:59,519
work during the nights and work you know

00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,240
as you know a certain time frame during

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:05,839
the day

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:07,360
in order to cover other time zones

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,760
and you know there are so many

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,640
statistics there they say that the worst

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:14,240
teams build

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:17,279
better products and let's think a bit

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,920
about this so what i mean by diversity

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,279
not necessarily about gender i guess

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,760
most of you here

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,800
think about this but other things means

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,720
also that

00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,720
you know teams or people that have

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,360
a different background a different

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,320
nationality a different culture

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,360
and imagine that this is also important

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,360
because

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,200
imagine that you are building your

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,520
company is building rack

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,880
for for

00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,959
[Music]

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,279
to be used by you know different

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,399
different people around the world

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:55,680
and if you your team will be

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:59,440
consisting of only off let's say

00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:03,600
white males that did the same uh

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:06,160
the same prestigious university uh in us

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,600
they probably have the same ideas and

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,279
you know

00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,640
the audience that they are building the

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:14,079
pro this product

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,120
is very diverse he's very different and

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,680
they have

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,240
different patients from this product so

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,680
by

00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,959
basically having a diverse team

00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:28,320
you kind of have diverse ideas

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:31,680
that go into and to into this product

00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:35,040
and then the product will be yeah

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:39,920
have better results and will be better

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:43,440
appreciated by um by a wider audience of

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:46,880
of your users um

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:51,519
so there are some statistics done uh

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:55,440
in 2016 or 2017

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,560
that cell diverse teams have 90 percent

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,760
higher revenue

00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:03,200
due to innovation and what i mean by

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:06,800
diverse they took into account

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:10,160
gender nationality career

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,680
industry age and education and basically

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,720
you see here

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:18,800
uh that companies with

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:22,160
um below average uh in diversity

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:26,320
you know lowered the score lower

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:29,040
um for for innovation

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,440
okay so let's see now uh from a

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,200
perspective of a manager

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,440
like what are the things that you need

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,279
to take into account when managing a

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,240
distributed team

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,240
so let's start with the challenges um

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,200
and obvious first one is

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,200
communication

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:52,720
because i think the most difficult is to

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:56,079
keep everyone on the same page and

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,639
the way we we managed to do that for

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,839
example

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,240
elastic was to um

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,120
you kind of need to learn to be more

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,200
organized

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:10,320
to take notes uh when you are having

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:14,240
a meeting call uh

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:16,639
just to be um available for everyone in

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:20,320
the team maybe the one outside the team

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:23,839
that kind of need to have um

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,880
an outcome of that meeting

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:30,399
um work independently it's

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:34,399
a challenge especially you know for

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:36,160
um those people just finnish university

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,199
and they don't really have experience

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,800
with a working environment i i

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,800
personally believe that it's kind of

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,800
difficult for them to

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,480
uh to adjust because they need a bit

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,720
more coaching

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,839
which is in my opinion a bit challenging

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,079
to be done

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:57,120
uh over you know in a distributed manner

00:13:54,079 --> 00:14:00,959
time zones um time zones is

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:04,959
in my opinion challenging um

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:08,959
when you know the the team that you are

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:11,360
little distributed across the continents

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,880
for example at elastic i was leading

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,720
teams there

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,079
based in u.s east coast west coast and

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,160
also europe

00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,320
uh and for a shorter period of time i

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,360
also managed um

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:28,000
mit there were people from asia

00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,399
and it was kind of challenging for us to

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,360
find

00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,199
time for for our meetings that fit

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,199
everyone

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:40,800
so i believe that time zone is really a

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:43,600
big challenge when you have to cover

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,440
when you have your team from all the

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,199
continents you know from

00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:53,120
asia and and um or australia

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,120
uh europe and the u.s

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:58,320
isolation is something that i think you

00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:01,839
need to be aware of

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:05,360
and make some effort

00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,360
to avoid that

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:13,519
especially when you hire people you know

00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:16,240
when you have someone in a new time zone

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,040
than the other team members and

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,720
sometimes

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:23,920
this can feel that person

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,279
can feel isolated and i think it's

00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:30,639
important to

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:34,320
to make sure you have a big

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:37,440
overlap meaning a few hours a day

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,880
between the team members in order to be

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:44,560
with you to synchronize with

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:46,880
our work i think this is indian

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,880
um

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:54,480
the the most important thing because

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,720
i feel like if you have very

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,680
very good and talented people in the

00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,040
company

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:04,880
they are very motivated they are very

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:07,360
willing to to do whatever they can

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:09,600
in order to make the company succeed to

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,120
make the product succeed

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:16,480
often your work is

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:20,560
um is happening and you have to

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:24,240
be careful when someone is approaching

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,320
uh born out because you know when you're

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:29,440
working from home it's very

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:32,800
difficult to um

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,680
you know to to turn you off because it's

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,560
hard to

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,120
make this differentiation between you

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,079
know

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,240
uh your personal life and work and

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,199
sometimes you say okay i got a slack

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,240
message

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:51,600
why not that's like a message right so

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:54,000
sometimes it's hard to to make this

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,680
okay so let's talk about collaboration

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,360
um

00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,920
yeah so i was saying that it's very

00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,360
important to use the right tools for

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,600
video conferencing

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,919
and i think we are living now in an era

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,760
there are so many options there

00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,480
for example elastic we use room and

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:14,160
slack a giant's phone we use google meat

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,799
and slack but i think it's important

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,160
that

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:20,559
you to learn to

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,079
to reduce the distractions because i

00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:25,280
think

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:28,240
you have you can easily have a few

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:31,440
thousands of female in a day a few

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,960
really a lot of notifications on slack

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,559
um and a few messages from your family

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,840
and friends and i think

00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:42,720
this can be overwhelming for uh

00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,760
for you so i think it's important to

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,880
plan your day

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,120
in order to to you know say you know

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,600
some people say i do emails

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,640
and only in this period of time in the

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,520
morning and

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,919
in order to be able also to do some work

00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,760
done

00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,160
during the day um and that's why i think

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,840
it's

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,600
important to to learn to um

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,559
work more asynchronously than

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,960
asynchronously in a distributed company

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,480
so what that means for example imagine

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,160
that you are engineer

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,919
and you have a problem and you don't

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,720
know the answer and you need some help

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,600
for it

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,280
and basically you will need to um ask

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,400
another colleague

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:27,120
uh you know about a solution

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,400
a possible solution and then you will

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,640
probably use slack

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,440
in order to get an immediate response

00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,880
but this sometimes you know if you are

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:40,000
always um asking direct

00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:42,480
you know synchronously this can

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,320
overwhelming for someone

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:49,360
and so for example more asynchronous

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,080
way you basically you know you are an

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,720
engineer

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,760
you create a pull request with your

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,440
feature

00:18:53,760 --> 00:19:00,480
and then you basically

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:04,400
ask for a feedback from other colleagues

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:07,440
um in that pure request in github

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,720
and then you wait a few days maybe to to

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,030
get the feedback

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,679
but this also makes you um

00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:17,440
[Music]

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:19,919
you know you makes yourself feel like

00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,960
you are stuck if you need to wait for a

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,760
few days for

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,960
you know for a feedback and i think you

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,840
know this

00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,400
the reality is that you need to to learn

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:32,320
to

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,760
um to do things in part basically not to

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,360
wait for one

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:40,400
uh one feedback or one answer

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,360
and to work on multiple things um on the

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,000
same time

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,679
in order not to be blocked by one so it

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,200
this kind of requires

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:51,120
maybe a bit of adjustment from my point

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,120
of view

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,160
but you know people have this uh

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,840
impression that

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,960
they're if they're working from home

00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:02,400
then they kind of need to be available

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,720
you know 24 hours and the way

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,000
basically people do and also the way i

00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,880
also did it is that you

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,320
block your calendar and also with

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,760
personal things so

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:16,880
like you need to go to the doctor or

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:19,039
you need to also spend time

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,440
with your family probably you know there

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,520
are some people that are very

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,000
for them it's very important to you know

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,480
to have this two hours in the evening to

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,840
have dinner with the family i don't know

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:33,440
things like this right

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:36,240
um you also block you know

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,320
the time where you are sleeping and and

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,360
this is important right especially

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:44,640
if your team is distributed

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,240
um across multiple time zones you know

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,559
that

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,280
might be difficult for someone to know

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:54,559
when basically you are sleeping

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:58,400
um yeah and and also

00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:00,580
another one is have regular one-on-ones

00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,919
or over video um

00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:04,960
[Music]

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,360
this is important because it's important

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,080
to

00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,960
also know you as a manager is important

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,000
to know

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,880
how your team feels about

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,159
if they have any blockers and you can

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,480
also discuss

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,600
you know all the things to discuss as a

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,080
manager

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,520
as a people manager with the team you

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,240
can basically

00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,960
uh you will do it over video you know i

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,480
think people

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:33,600
have this um um

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,320
people feel like if you are working from

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,000
home

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:40,720
then they feel like they are not able to

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,760
have a close connection with their

00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,320
colleagues

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,360
but from my experience i feel the other

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,840
way around

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:52,799
i feel like if in a distributed company

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,600
i feel like you you will have a closer

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,400
connection

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,080
with your colleagues just because you

00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,960
see them in their

00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,320
uh natural environment right and if you

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,960
are going to new office

00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,600
i feel like the moment you open the door

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,559
to the office you are a different person

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:13,600
you are more like a business person

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:17,200
right and then you just do a chit chat

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:20,159
and and and and things like this um

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,159
but you know when you are working in a

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:25,280
distributed environment

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:28,320
and then you have you see

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,880
the colleagues um you know surrounded by

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,440
their family and often you see

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,960
a colleague with their baby in their uh

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,200
hand during the

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,320
uh during the conference call you feel

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,559
like you know

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:44,720
you are better um

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:47,520
or you have a closer relationship with

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,320
them uh

00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,320
so i think also you know many companies

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,880
out there they also organize

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,760
face-to-face time i think this is also

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,360
important

00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,960
and you know there are some means they

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,080
do this twice

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:05,039
or three times a year where the

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,919
entire team or maybe the entire company

00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,960
is gathering

00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,520
in one place to meet face to face i

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,400
think this

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,360
is this is something that is important

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,559
to have

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:19,679
um and um

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:23,120
just to also you know have some uh

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,000
some time with with with the people so

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:28,240
basically you

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:31,600
like like how tall this person is

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,840
and how this person is uh like yeah it

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:35,600
is

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,090
this sometimes helps so recognize work

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,000
um

00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:41,679
[Music]

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,080
so i think this is something that

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,520
no matter if it's a distributed company

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,440
or not i think

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,039
i believe that you need to judge people

00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,360
by their results

00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,640
not by their working hours i think in a

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:56,159
distributed environment

00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:59,440
anyway you cannot really um uh

00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:01,919
you know count the number of

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,039
of our personal work i think from my

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,640
point of view

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:07,919
this is uh i think this is how i usually

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,919
evaluate people

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,880
like their results over a longer period

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:16,600
of time usually a few months

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:19,600
um and this is also a lot allows them

00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,400
to innovate and from my point of view

00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,679
this is

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:27,039
really the most important thing is to

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:29,600
offer um engineers to

00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:31,279
uh to have the freedom to uh to innovate

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,760
and

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,840
another thing is like okay they they

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:38,400
come up with new ideas but i think it's

00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,030
important to give early feedback

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,159
and you know not wait for um

00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:45,600
[Music]

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,080
for uh for the you know for the idea to

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,120
um

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:52,480
to become bigger and uh before

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:55,520
you you give a feedback career graph

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,159
i think this is um and i feel like when

00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,559
in a distributed environment i feel like

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,080
you

00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:04,240
kind of need to trust people more um

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,120
just because i think people like feel

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,600
like

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,279
they can trust someone if they see

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,400
someone near there

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:14,799
in the in the office but i think maybe

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,559
you know in in in a distributed

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,600
environment you need to trust people

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:21,440
more

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:24,559
um yeah um

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,559
yeah from from from the beginning um

00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:29,360
i think it's important to encourage

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:33,679
people to drive projects by themselves

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:36,799
um because

00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,679
yeah i know we are a bit of a bit late

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,840
here

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:44,559
so uh um i think an important

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:48,720
um an important thing to

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:51,360
um to to you as a manager to

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,480
help people grow in their career is to

00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,080
mentor them

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:59,520
and because of that um i created this

00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,679
non-profit organization called tupu

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:02,799
where we offer free mentorship for

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:07,039
underrepresented

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:10,960
groups in tech and so feel free to

00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:14,240

everyone

00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:24,159
um this is basically all the people

00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,440
are helping me with running this our

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,679

uh all the mentors are also volunteers

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,840
and it's

00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:39,919
amazing how many people are

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:43,440
willing to you know

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:46,320
give a bit of from their

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:49,760
free time to help others grow in their

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,480
career and succeed in in their career

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,520
so let's see what's coming next um so

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,240
what will happen

00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:58,320
after this coronavir virus hopefully

00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:02,559
ends

00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:06,559
and basically companies

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:10,080
will come having again

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:12,240
um an office culture and you know you

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:15,039
see a lot of things on media like

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,400
twitter goes remote and host global all

00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:20,000
hands on slack

00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:23,200
even google is now is working from home

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,159
until september 2021 and

00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,200
uh i think it is thinking to allow three

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,159
days a week

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,360
in office afterwards so i feel like you

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,880
know there is

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:38,240
this coronavirus managed to

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:41,600
to to change uh

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:44,799
to rapidly rapidly change the way

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:49,120
companies are are structured and

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:49,120
