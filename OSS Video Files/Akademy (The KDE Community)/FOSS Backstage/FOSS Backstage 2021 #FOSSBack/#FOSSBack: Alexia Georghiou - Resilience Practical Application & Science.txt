Title: #FOSSBack: Alexia Georghiou - Resilience Practical Application & Science
Publication date: 2021-03-01
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	We all have stressors in life, and they have been profound with the challenges the COVID19 pandemic has brought forth. How are we responding to these stressors? A larger question to ask, ‘is it the leader’s responsibility to foster self-care at work to address this burnout epidemic?” In this presentation we talk about burnout, define self care with science backed strategies to build resilience in teams.


Participants will learn about burnout, the benefits of support and elements of self care.


Participants will learn what empathy is, and how regulate emotions in their daily lives.


Participants will learn about the science of well-being and how a positive mindset is proven to benefit workplace productivity, engagement and bottom line earnings.


Participants will receive training in mindset development with mental exercises.

hi

00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,000
everybody um i want to tell you some

00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,519
about

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,960
my background i have been a mental

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,840
health therapist for 25 plus years

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,119
and i recently started studying the

00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,439
science of

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:25,039
happiness so we're going to talk about

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:28,640
happiness and how do we bring that about

00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,880
burnout is a hot topic i

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,000
read this article on harvard business

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,399
review

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,079
and it just came out february the 10th

00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,960
and so i want to start with this

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,079
for you to know this is being studied in

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,200
the top

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:46,719
business schools here in the states

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,559
and they found how do we prevent burnout

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,840
we need a sense of purpose with what

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:53,760
we're doing

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,960
a manageable workload and this is very

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,680
interesting

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,079
feeling that we can discuss our mental

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,760
health

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:05,120
at work and having an

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,120
empathetic manager

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:13,040
so do you feel like this is your life

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,400
where things are in your way

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,720
and some of it is inside your head

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:22,799
so self-doubt worry

00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:26,479
excuses and

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,960
things are just blocking you and maybe

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,640
not

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,880
maybe you say i'm just doing great

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,479
something to think about today have you

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,000
ever known someone

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:40,159
who died all of a sudden and

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,159
here in the states people say well they

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,280
were eating really healthy and they were

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,799
exercising

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:50,159
why did they die the research shows us

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,960
that the self-care and resilience and

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,560
what's going on

00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:57,600
on the inside affects our health

00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,719
just as much as smoking a

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,680
pack of cigarettes a day just as much as

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,560
our diet

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,560
and exercise

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:11,039
so this is a new concept that we're

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,280
learning about

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,800
in mental and physical health and

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,920
researchers are finding

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,520
how connected we are

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:25,200
there's a vagal nerve and

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:28,560
this nerve is activated with a stress

00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,840
response so there's a difference between

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,959
stress

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,000
stress is actually normal

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:39,840
all of us have stress and we may use

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,720
the term stressed out i'm stressed out

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,879
and learning how to manage stress is

00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,599
very important for us and it's not a bad

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,040
thing

00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:52,400
and it's good to see stress as healthy

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:55,680
that this is just part of life uh so

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,319
when we have a stress response that's

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,599
very

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,879
different and this vagal nerve

00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,239
runs all the way down our body so what

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,120
that means is

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,680
that stress response affects our whole

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,959
body

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,040
it's not just in one area and

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,280
so think about where do you feel the

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,319
stress is it tension here

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:21,440
is it a headache do you tense up in

00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:23,680
other parts of your body and

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,840
it's important for us to increase our

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,360
awareness and that's why we're talking

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,159
about this today

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,040
we want to stay in this green zone and

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,280
identify

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:38,920
what helps us to stay in this green zone

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:42,239
breathing meditation prayer

00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:46,879
curiosity openness

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,519
and we need to stay here but the reality

00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,920
is

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,200
that response kicks us up to the red

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,080
zone

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,120
and we're gonna respond one way or

00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,319
another

00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:02,560
we're gonna fight or we're gonna flight

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:06,159
so run away or run towards

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,680
if this really shocks us

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:12,480
then we're gonna freeze and

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,760
this is where we become depressed we're

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,199
not responding

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:20,400
we feel helpless we feel hopeless

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,880
we feel trapped and what's interesting

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,560
here

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,720
is shame if you've ever felt ashamed

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,040
whether you talked about it or not this

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,360
is in the free zone

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,120
so what do we need to do that's what

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,520
we're here to talk about today

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,880
so we can go from that freeze then we're

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,479
going to go to the red zone

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,479
and then to the green zone so it

00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,639
progresses

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,800
i will make these slides and resources

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,400
so you will be able to read

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,840
everything in um pdf format

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,960
so there's stress that we can control

00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,919
and stress that we can't control so

00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,800
what is in our control checking email so

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,600
we can say

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,080
i'm going to focus on checking email

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,960
these three times throughout the day

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,240
the research is showing that when we pay

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,800
attention to one

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,960
task and become fully absorbed in it

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,000
it's really good for our brain health

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:21,440
so the multitasking is out i

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,199
am a huge multitasker and so i'm having

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,440
to learn this

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,600
to focus on one thing at a time give the

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,039
brain a break and then focus on another

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,240
task

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:35,440
so email is something we can control

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,080
how we check it and when we respond what

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,720
can we

00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,280
not control we cannot control the world

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,400
events

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:46,160
and what's happening around us and

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:49,199
there are some um interesting studies

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,240
that learn helplessness it

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,759
causes depression so if we're watching a

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,479
lot of what's happening in

00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,919
in the world and cannot do anything

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,000
about it

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,919
then that's going to lead to loss of

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,880
hope and depression

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:08,720
because as human beings we want to fix

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,720
things we want to problem solve

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,400
okay so what do we need for healthy

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,000
brain functioning

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,360
a healthy body a healthy mind it's all

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,319
intertwined

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,440
nutrition and i'm not here to tell you

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,639
to eat

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,560
beans but the studies have shown that

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,319
cultures that eat beans

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:35,440
and less meat live longer exercise

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,680
that really helps us um

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,240
to with the brain functioning to

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,680
decrease those feelings that we have to

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,800
regulate them

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,199
we need water our brain components are

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,319
made mostly of water

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:52,960
sunshine so it's getting

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,479
out there there's a seasonal affective

00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,080
disorder in the winter

00:06:54,479 --> 00:07:01,280
when it's dark and gloomy it affects us

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,000
so uh if there's a sun shine moment in

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,199
the day

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,639
go outside and just soak it in um

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:11,440
15 minutes it's wonderful and depression

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,440
can be caused by low vitamin d levels

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,599
and so it's important if you're feeling

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,000
depression to have that checked by the

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,560
doctor

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,240
because that can be easily fixed by

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,520
taking supplements and getting more

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,680
sunshine

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,680
so temperance everything in moderation

00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,000
self-restraint and

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,160
so there's research breakups are related

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,960
to alcohol abuse

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,000
we don't make good decisions if we're

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:41,520
abusing substances

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,599
fresh air it's very important to get

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,599
fresh air in the epidemic in

00:07:44,599 --> 00:07:49,280
1919 eureka california

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,879
there were so many people sick with the

00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,440
flu uh the

00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,639
army built tents and the people who were

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,720
in the tents

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,560
healed faster than the people who were

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,759
inside in the hospital

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,720
so unfortunately the hospitals have had

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,599
to seal

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,000
the windows i asked a nurse recently

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,039
here

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,599
locally i'm in tennessee in the usa and

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,560
she said yep we would tell people their

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,560
diagnosis

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,479
their prognosis and they would try to

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,759
jump out the window and that's why

00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:23,120
we had to seal the windows we need

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:26,240
rest we need at least seven hours

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,240
of sleep a night uh and

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,599
there's research in countries like the

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,880
uk germany

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,719
and the us 40 of our population

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,000
isn't getting at least seven hours of

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,959
sleep has

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,360
this pandemic affected your sleep

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:41,839
there's

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,880
exercises that we can do there are

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,760
routines

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,320
self-care is very important the research

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,600
shows

00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,000
that the tech disrupts so

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,360
have a time when you say i'm going to

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,480
put this up

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,480
and i'm gonna say no more tech and

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,080
it could be 15 minutes before you go to

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,399
bed um

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,880
in your bedroom don't have your

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,399
electronics because it will disrupt your

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,000
sleep

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:13,440
tv is okay uh if you want to feel that

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,320
that sound and rest and

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,600
working in our bed having meetings in

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,000
our bedroom

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,720
uh it affects our psyche because our

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,240
psyche needs to say oh this is the place

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,320
that i rest and i unplug also i heard a

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,959
psychologist share

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,519
that the research is showing taking a

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,640
shower

00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,000
at night so we're warm from the shower

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,720
and then our body is cooling

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,120
down and it's signaling to our body it's

00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,600
time to sleep

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,320
we're going to focus on the final one

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,760
today

00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:51,360
trust and the happiness studies

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:54,240
and what they're showing so when we

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,560
are close to people that we feel safe

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,800
with

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,440
psychologically that we know that they

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,839
love us that we can depend on them

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,079
um then this gives us higher life

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,279
expectancy

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:10,160
up to 14 years longer

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,560
knowing our life has meaning gives us up

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,240
to

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,240
seven years longer

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,079
dr martin seligman at the university of

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,440
pennsylvania has

00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:27,279
a theory of well-being uh we

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,760
have emotions emotions happen express

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,880
them

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,040
talk about them regulate to positive

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,240
okay we're gonna talk about what a

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,519
positive mindset

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:40,480
does uh being engaged

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:42,160
being socially engaged being engaged in

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,800
our work

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,680
positive relationships so the studies

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,480
are showing

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,600
that it's okay to argue it's how we

00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,600
argue

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,920
it's uh it's can we solve the problem

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,000
and communicate and move forward with

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:01,680
that that's normal when you have

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,880
people we're gonna have conflict and

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,600
so people even with a lot of chronic

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,480
pain

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,920
elderly people reported high levels of

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,560
happiness

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,680
if they knew that they had someone to

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,720
depend on them

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:19,920
the world happiness report that came out

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:23,839
in march of 2020 showed

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:27,279
one out of 11 people in the world

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:30,640
stated i have no one to depend on

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:33,040
and that's an alarming statistic that is

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,000
before the pandemic so what has the

00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,720
shutdown

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
caused for people we need to feel that

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,040
sense of meaning

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,200
and accomplishment so this

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,399
is our theory of well-being from

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,680
positive psychology

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,639
okay so one small positive thought in

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,839
the morning

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,720
can change your whole day there's a

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,680
study

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,399
by michelle gillen and sean aker three

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,760
minutes

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:04,399
of negative news in the morning

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,360
people reported 27 percent greater

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,880
likelihood

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,519
an unhappy day six to eight hours

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,279
later as compared to the positive

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,320
condition

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:19,360
so we need to be careful how much

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,800
news we're watching and not to start our

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,800
day with negative news

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:28,079
because it could affect our day

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,839
all right what does this you know really

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:31,279
i'm not gonna pay attention to things

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,240
because we don't realize what we're

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,720
missing

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,639
uh and having our brain at a positive

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,519
state we're gonna notice more things

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,720
so if you're thinking whatever industry

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,440
you are in

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,120
uh we want to pay attention to detail

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,120
you know happiness studies are showing

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:51,200
the positive state

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:54,480
increases our accuracy on tasks

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:57,600
and if you want to read more sean aker

00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,000
in the happiness advantage he studied

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,360
people around the world and this is in

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,399
businesses

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,720
and he showed that doctors are going to

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,959
make

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,079
better diagnoses if their brain isn't

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,000
positive

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:12,000
sales people are going to make a higher

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,200
percentage of sales

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:18,079
so i want you to watch this video count

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,560
how many times the people with the white

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,160
shirt

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:25,200
pass the ball this is a test of

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,200
selective attention

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:35,839
count how many times the players wearing

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:35,839
white pass the basketball

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,120
how many passes did you count the

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:08,160
correct answer

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:12,399
is 15 passes but did you see the

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:15,680
okay did you see the gorilla

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,120
that's the question and uh we're gonna

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,040
hear the commentary

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,519
the next slide is a test of selective

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,519
attention

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,120
count how many times the player's

00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:31,839
wearing white

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:31,839
here we go okay here's the commentary

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,360
one of my best known studies was done

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,480
with my collaborator chris chabri some

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,639
years ago

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,320
and what we had was a video in which

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,680
people were passing basketballs

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,360
so three people were wearing white

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,880
shirts and they were passing a ball

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,199
and your task when you were watching the

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,519
video was just to count how many times

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,880
those three players passed the ball we

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,560
also had three players wearing black

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,160
shirts passing their own ball

00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,399
and you were supposed to ignore their

00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,760
passes so as you're doing this task

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,680
after about 30 seconds

00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,519
say you have a person wearing a full

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,399
body gorilla suit walk into the middle

00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,079
of the scene

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,160
stop in the center turn and face the

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,760
camera thump its chest and then walk off

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,120
the other side a total of about nine

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,120
seconds later

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,560
and what we find is that about half the

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,880
people who do this

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,800
simply don't notice the gorilla when dan

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,800
asked me to be a part of this experiment

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:23,440
i thought no way people are totally

00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,279
going to see me i'm a 400 pound gorilla

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,639
we rewind the tape and show it to them

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:27,760
again and the reaction is typically i

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,160
miss that

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:33,920
it's shocking that you could possibly

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,920
miss something as obvious as a gorilla

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,759
looking isn't the same as seeing we have

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,880
to focus attention on something in order

00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,040
to become aware of it

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,040
you

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,279
the key is that when you're focusing

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,680
your attention on one aspect of your

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,199
world

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,959
you don't have an unlimited amount of

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,399
attention to devote to other things

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,480
and we only see those things that we

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,839
focus our attention on the problem is

00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,279
that on occasion we filter something

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,480
that we might want to notice

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,480
and we don't realize that we're doing

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,639
that that sort of

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,000
mismatch between what we see and what we

00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,000
think we see

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,839
is a really profound one that has all

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,839
sorts of consequences for daily lives

00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:19,279
okay so did you see the gorilla

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:21,360
about half the people who watch that

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:24,720
video in the studies

00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,680
do not see the gorilla and it's really

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,480
interesting

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,720
because we don't realize what we don't

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,720
see

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,320
the happiness studies what is this all

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,800
about that it's suddenly a science uh

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,440
when i earned my master's degree in

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:46,000
counseling it was in the early 90s and

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:48,560
we were not taught empirical research

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,839
and as i continued the continuing

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,000
education

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,880
about 10 years ago i started hearing

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,079
that this

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:59,440
is empirically proven and now

00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:02,720
we have technology with a.i

00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:05,520
that we can scan people's brains

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,039
and read emotions and that's really

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,400
powerful

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:13,839
because there are studies that say

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:16,720
practice gratitude sean aker

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,319
he asked his participants write three

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,120
things every day that you're grateful

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,120
for

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:22,319
three different things every day so just

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,720
jot it down

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:29,679
he scanned the brain before with the

00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:31,440
fmri functional mri and then he scanned

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,240
the participants brains

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,000
23 days afterwards and there were

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,240
remarkable results

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,280
so our brain will go to positive when

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,520
we're practicing

00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,039
gratitude right there that is something

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,520
to do to keep us

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:47,200
in that green zone or to get us back in

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:50,400
that green zone

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:54,160
so i'm in the red i'm uh

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,600
very upset and okay

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,240
you know there's a reason that we're

00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:01,760
angry there's a reason that we're afraid

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:05,120
and talk about it journal about it

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,440
get it out and then practice some

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:11,679
gratitude because that's going to help

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:15,120
us go back to the green and

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:18,640
it definitely affects our blood pressure

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:21,919
our hearts and it stresses

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:25,520
our whole system

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:29,039
happiness studies okay harvard has an

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,880
ongoing 80-year study

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,840
on the well-being and happiness of

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,559
people robert waldinger is currently the

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,960
head of it

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,640
he's a zen master it's interesting to

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,280
hear him talk about it

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,080
and they started at harvard because in

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,400
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,720
this is who you studied were the men who

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,360
went to harvard there were no women

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,160
and then they went to a lower

00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:53,760
socioeconomic area

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:56,240
in boston and they got a group of men

00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,520
and they followed their lives all these

00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,600
years

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,440
so it's not just questionnaires that

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,400
they're asking them they're also doing

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:08,080
physicals and blood tests and they're

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:11,360
interviewing their wives their families

00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:12,080
and they were shocked they were shocked

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,679
to find

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:18,799
out that happiness the key to happiness

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:21,600
is connection and our relationships

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,640
so if we look at the first slide i

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,360
showed you

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,480
social connection keeps us in that green

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,760
zone

00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:32,799
that's medically scientifically

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,280
proven it's not money like we need a

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,960
certain

00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,799
amount of money to live and be

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,880
comfortable and of course that affects

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:41,280
our happiness

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,880
but they're showing the research up to a

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,440
certain amount

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,480
because we want to live comfortably and

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,280
after that

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,880
we could have a lot more money and it

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,160
wouldn't increase our happiness

00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:57,919
what does sustain our happiness and

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,919
cause it is connection

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:05,440
okay so we're not ignoring the problems

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,880
we're looking at the problems we're

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,880
solving the problems

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,840
we're being very rational and we're

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,880
looking at the upside

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:18,159
optimism we are not naturally

00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:21,120
optimistic most of us aren't

00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,600
and so it's a skill it's a muscle that

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,440
we

00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:28,320
can build and we don't even realize

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,720
how negative our thinking is and so

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,679
think

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:34,320
about having a buddy with you uh to

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:37,360
catch you when you say things that

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:40,720
are negative or pessimistic

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,320
so for example i'm driving and i have a

00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,679
flat tire

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,240
or i'm playing sports and

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,400
i'm not performing really well we're not

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,520
going to let that ruin the game

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,320
or ruin the day so i get the flat tire

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,640
fixed

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,640
what's my thinking so pay attention

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,960
what's your thinking during that time

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,799
am i thinking now my day is ruined i

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,280
can't believe this happened

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,960
bad things always happen to me catch

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,000
those thoughts

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:13,440
and we can say nope that's not the truth

00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,799
um you know i'm getting this tire fixed

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,760
or if you're playing football i'm gonna

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,919
take a break and

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,159
go back to the football game and i am

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:25,760
using that word we call it soccer

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,320
here in the u.s and take that mental

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,039
break

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,640
and you will not ruin my day and again

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,200
kick the bring the positive

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,000
with some thoughts of gratitude it

00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,520
literally

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:41,440
will light up your brain and reset uh

00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:44,080
so recharging think about your phone

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,400
every day i have to plug this phone in

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:50,080
and it gets a charge

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:53,600
also apple sends me updates so i need to

00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,080
update the software so every day we need

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,600
to

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:59,760
charge ourselves with self-care

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,960
making sure that we get the nutrients

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,559
and exercise

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:07,440
and sunlight and focus on

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:09,120
our thinking and feel comfortable with

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,159
expressing emotions

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:14,159
and i know that's very new

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,240
in our culture we're not used to doing

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,480
that especially at work

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,159
and so we're but we heard from the

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,280
harvard business review

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:26,000
also i took some classes with wharton

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,799
executive education and there are

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,120
studies

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,159
love at work this is a study by segal

00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,559
barsad

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,400
where across industries they have

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,960
studied when employees

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,039
feel a sense of belonging at work when

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,360
employees feel cared for

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,400
and love is practiced towards one

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,120
another

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,080
then they will take care of their

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,320
customers

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,960
their clients and their patients

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,960
naturally

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,840
okay so dr stewart friedman he's out of

00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,880
wharton

00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,559
he studied people's lives and we hear

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,240
work-life balance

00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,799
um it's and it's not so much of a

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,200
balance especially now with the pandemic

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,960
we are in a time many people are still

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,840
working from home

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,919
how do you integrate work in life so

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,960
when things are tense at work

00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:20,559
flex the family and the personal life

00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:23,120
when things are tense at home flex work

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,720
are we able to do that so he just talks

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,240
a little bit about that

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,480
come on you've gotta sacrifice

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,120
everything in your life right

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,679
and what i knew from my own experience

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,799
but also as a consultant as a coach as a

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,440
as an educator

00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,640
and as a researcher was that that's

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,799
actually not true

00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,720
even though that is the common wisdom

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,320
and certainly i'm not saying here that

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,640
you know you can you can have everything

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:49,440
all the time and that uh

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,520
uh you know you can have success without

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,039
without sacrifice without effort

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,720
without you know discipline and

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,640
persistence in the face of

00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,159
in the face of disappointment but what i

00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,440
am saying

00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,279
is that not only is it possible

00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,679
to create a greater sense of harmony

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:08,240
among the different parts of your life

00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,520
while achieving greatness it's actually

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,840
necessary

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,080
that the people who are most successful

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:18,480
even by you know external markers of

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:21,039
fame and wealth uh and you know power

00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,679
those are the folks who are able to

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,080
figure out

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:25,600
in their own way how to bring together

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,000
the different parts of their lives

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,640
over the course of their lives and

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,880
indeed it's their commitments to family

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,919
to community and to their private selves

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,480
their minds

00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,360
bodies spirits that's what gives them

00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,320
the strength

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,880
the resources of the support that they

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,480
need

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,559
to be successful in the professional

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,520
world so so reason one was to address

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,840
this issue of

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,720
you know uh you have to sacrifice

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,159
everything

00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,159
not true and you're saying it's it's a

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,200
false choice basically it's a false

00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,919
choice that

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,640
it holds us back from the kinds of

00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,240
success

00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:00,320
the kinds of happiness that you're

00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,080
talking about indeed uh

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,360
that to think in terms of you know the

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,400
binary work

00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,320
life balance which is a term that i

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,159
have been railing against for decades

00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,679
and i think i think we're making some

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,400
progress there because more people are

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,960
talking

00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,240
instead about working life integration

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,600
or harmony

00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,400
uh over the course of life and that okay

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,279
so there we have an established

00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,480
professor

00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:30,240
talking about i'm jeff in a creation

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:33,120
uh so what is our takeaway today

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,840
you may be saying i'm young and i'm

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,480
strong

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,520
and i'm pretty resilient and i get that

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,720
i remember

00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,960
30 years ago i'm gonna be 51 on sunday

00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,159
so wish me a happy birthday

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:49,520
and boy you know life happens

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:51,600
uh disappointments happen and uh

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,520
it doesn't just happen to older people

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:55,440
it happens too when we're younger but i

00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,000
remember when i was younger

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,919
that it's more challenging now in a lot

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:05,200
of ways not just physically

00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:07,840
but also uh with the stress response

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,799
but it is important it will have an

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,279
effect

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:13,200
uh what we're doing with our emotions

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:16,320
and our self-care it will

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:18,000
catch up with us so in some cultures

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,320
like in japan

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,039
people who work too hard they have heart

00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,799
attacks

00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,159
there was nothing wrong with them it was

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,320
the stress response

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,520
and they weren't taking care of

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,559
themselves

00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,760
okay so a positive outlook makes our

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:34,880
brains perform

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,480
better achieving a positive mindset is

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,799
fostered by happiness

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,000
and this comes about with strong

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:43,440
connections

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,960
this is our scientifically backed

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:49,840
takeaway for today so i would love

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,279
to take questions and meet with you in a

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:55,039
breakout room
