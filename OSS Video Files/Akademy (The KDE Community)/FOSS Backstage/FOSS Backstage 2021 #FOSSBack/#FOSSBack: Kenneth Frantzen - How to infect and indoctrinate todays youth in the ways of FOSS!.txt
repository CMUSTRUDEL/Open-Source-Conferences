Title: #FOSSBack: Kenneth Frantzen - How to infect and indoctrinate todays youth in the ways of FOSS!
Publication date: 2021-02-23
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	We all wish for the up and coming young generation to get thoroughly and completely immersed in the world of FOSS. They should eat, drink and breath it to become good and loyal members of the community.

But... many of them do not even know that FOSS exists. Their eyes never leave the smartphone screens and they dream of Microsoft Windows, Adobe Photoshop, Apple iPhone and Xbox. So how do we enlighten them? How to we let the everloving glow of FOSS reach in to their dark and dreary lives?

As a teacher in Web development for students who aim to become engineers ("Gymnasieingenjör i Mjukvaruutveckling"), I teach them how modern software development is steeped in FOSS philosophy and try to show them all the posibilitys that rise from the community.  This is a short insight in how FOSS can (and should) be a big part of secondary education in Sweden.

hope you've all been enjoying the

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,720
conference

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,920
so far i've been at least some really

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,720
interesting ideas

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,400
flowing out there and i'm glad to see

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,799
you all here now i hope you will at

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,400
least

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:21,520
find some interesting discussion points

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,159
out of all the things i will

00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,119
talk to you about the material i will

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,280
bring forth

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,240
but but firstly the question on

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,240
everyone's lips

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:35,200
who am i and what right do i have to

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,880
have an opinion well kenneth francien is

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,079
my name as you heard and

00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,640
i work as a web development teacher

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,600
so i and i worked as a web developer

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,960
before

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,200
but now i mainly teach and it's on the

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,680
west coast of sweden

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,240
and my students they can become anything

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,439
from

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,640
software engineers to web developers or

00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:01,119
network technicians and

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,759
you might have heard my voice before

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,960
perhaps

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,840
i've been on a few podcasts like hacker

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,440
public radio

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:13,120
or all in it radio

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:16,480
or maybe not well

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,760
the thing about youth

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,480
i mean we are in the open source

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,160
community

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,480
the free and open source community we

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,840
have sort of

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:31,840
built in this idea of propagating

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,920
our beliefs and we like to talk about

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,680
what we're interested in we

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:42,239
enjoy spreading the word as it were

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:45,519
about what we do and why we do it

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:49,280
and somehow we

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:53,360
often get our kids if we are

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,680
old enough to have kids or perhaps

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,239
our acquaintances involved in some way

00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,239
or another

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,879
and that is true even though the thing

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,040
that we are talking about

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,400
is some what i shouldn't say inherently

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,519
boring but

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,239
i mean we we are talking about code and

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,640
licensing of code here

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,519
it isn't the most spectacular and most

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,800
interesting of fields

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:26,879
however you look at it

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:30,480
but it is a very effective way

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,480
to produce and

00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,959
govern software

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,760
and that is something we have discovered

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,799
and that is something we believe in

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,959
so as a teacher

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,959
i

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:50,640
i have sort of a a responsibility

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,439
to to give this knowledge to uh

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,439
others right i should have switched the

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,640
image here

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,280
the image you see here is from a drupal

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,640
camp

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:05,760
in gothenburg where i live and

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,159
you can find me on this picture if you

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,760
look

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:15,680
at the lower left part

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:18,880
in the firefox t-shirt behind a balloon

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,040
that is me and the one actually

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,320
who posted this picture is the man on

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,160
the top left

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:29,040
olamia verchon who who got this

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,919
conference together uh drupal camp and

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,440
drupal is

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:36,400
as i guess many of you know a

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,800
cms content management system which is

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,160
very

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,680
popular it's one of the greatest ones

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,960
most used after of course number one

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,440
which is a wordpress

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,600
so i've been involved in such

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,960
conferences as well

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:58,800
and i try to take

00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,800
in when i have older pupils students

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,800
i try to bring them to these conferences

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,160
if possible

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:09,759
and it is a good way to

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:13,520
make them see and make them appreciate

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:17,199
that what i say isn't the only

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,840
voice that says this because

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,720
when you are in a classroom situation it

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,800
it

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:28,080
it sort of becomes the teacher saying

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:31,120
something and the pupils the students

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,720
listening and shrugging just thinking

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,720
that yeah well that's what he says

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,039
and of course that is not how education

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,840
should be

00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,120
we me and my colleagues we try all the

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,520
time to

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:51,440
integrate our education with

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,880
conference talks like this one

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,919
to show the pupils show the students

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,960
that

00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:02,240
we are a part of

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,120
a global movement and there are a lot of

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,840
people that actually think this is

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,840
important

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,280
all right but still it's not easy to

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:17,440
reach students

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,440
they are in sort of a

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:24,080
troublesome position they are

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,759
surrounded by a lot of people and a lot

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:28,319
of organizations

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,240
that is not really interested in free

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,520
and open source software

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,160
and if we just give an

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,600
eye to what sort of companies they are

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,759
surrounded by

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:45,360
well we have this famous example

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:48,560
microsoft who went from saying that

00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,360
linux is a cancer and open source

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,440
software is

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:57,599
communism and a threat to society

00:06:53,440 --> 00:07:01,520
under steve bahmer as ceo of microsoft

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:04,000
to what we hear now recently where

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,800
as well the ceo microsoft but now satya

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,319
nadella

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:11,520
says that we are all in on open source

00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:14,639
so they have made a change

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:19,280
they have made an image change and

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:23,360
an idea change which is mainly

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:27,840
governed by their need to

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:31,440
embrace open source or go under

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,360
to be be totally frank because they

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,199
are seeing themselves more and more as a

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,800
cloud company as does many other

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,240
companies

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:43,840
the internet has really changed

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,199
the way that companies reach their

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,759
customers

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,319
so being a cloud company you cannot

00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,759
ignore

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:54,879
open source because foss is what built

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,759
the internet it's what it's built on

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,319
and no matter how you think about it you

00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,919
can't

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:06,319
escape that but even though

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:09,360
a large company like microsoft can

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:13,520
have these

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,599
ideas and intentions which so far seems

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,120
well meant and they actually do

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,160
contribute to

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:23,840
the foss community today

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:27,199
which is very nice to see but but still

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:30,879
that is something that occurs on a plane

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:35,440
on and on a horizon which

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:39,039
my students never reach or never see

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,599
it doesn't affect them because

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,479
the software that runs in these clouds

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,600
and

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:49,040
the software that they run

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:52,800
isn't really in any way

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:56,000
or form um affected by this

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,160
i mean if they buy a new xbox what does

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,959
that say about free and open source

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,080
i'm certain there are some free and open

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,880
source

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,480
in the xbox and there probably are some

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,320
documentation

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:14,399
that recites the gpl somewhere

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,240
but the 14 year old who is playing on

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:20,399
that game system

00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:23,760
probably doesn't know or care either

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:27,120
so this is what the companies they are

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:31,360
surrounded by are like and

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:33,680
we have a situation where

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,600
well it's the law of the lee or of least

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,440
resistance

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:43,680
i mean adobe adobe photoshop is

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:46,720
equivalent to editing pictures

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:50,880
but it shouldn't have to be

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:54,640
and a large part of that is

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,800
not only that adobe is good at making

00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,040
themselves known in the public but also

00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,040
that

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,240
the alternatives are not known by those

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,839
who should

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,839
teach the alternatives

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:12,720
so students they know what

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:16,399
the latest coolest most expensive things

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,839
are and they want them they want to be

00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:23,440
cool in the eyes of their peers

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:26,000
and who who doesn't really

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,560
okay so so that is the corporate side of

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,600
things

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,320
what actually influences students that

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,720
way but

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,399
what does the government think how does

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,720
the government

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,200
approach free and open source software

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,760
in relation to education in sweden

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,200
well there are things being said from

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,160
time to time

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,640
in the latest 10 years there have popped

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,240
up

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:54,079
thoughts and ideas about

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:57,279
implementing more force in

00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:01,600
the way that the country is governed

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:03,920
and how the schools operate

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,200
and we have a copy of a couple of quotes

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,560
here on

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,959
screen you see they started

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,120
an organization the government started

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,640
an organization which had

00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,959
impart the mandate to

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,680
strive for public administration as far

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,800
as possible

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:26,160
to build its solutions on open standards

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:29,760
use open source software and so on

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:32,560
so so that has actually been written

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,959
from the government on official paper

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,160
and

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:38,720
uh well stuff happened with that

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:41,920
organization but

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,399
that is neither here nor there and if

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:48,720
you read

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:52,880
the instructions given by the government

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,839
for the secondary educational system in

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,240
sweden

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,600
it says actually what you see in the

00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,839
second quote here

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,200
that the school should be open to

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,200
different ideas and encourage

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,120
their expression it should emphasize the

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,160
importance of forming personal views

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:11,839
and provide opportunities for doing this

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,839
it is also a strong

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:18,560
you can find strong wording for

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:22,800
democracy and uh

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:26,720
ethical thinking ethical reflections

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:30,399
about how what you

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:33,040
learn as a student how that affects

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,639
the rest of the country and the rest of

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,760
the world

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,959
our fellow human beings and

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:43,600
in that sure it's not really

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,560
directly related to free and open source

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,079
but still

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:53,519
in that you can find the idea of foss

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:56,639
actually quite snugly making its place

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,560
and especially since we

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,279
have sort of the situation where it's

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:05,120
not even mentioned at all

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:08,959
so it absolutely there is room

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:12,399
for free and open source uh and if you

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:15,440
just mentioned quickly about how

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:18,880
the swedish educational system is uh

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:22,000
built the if you are

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,519
somewhat involved in education anywhere

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,440
in the world you probably

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:29,920
recognize a few of these um ideas and

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,240
the way this is organized but

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,399
the main thing for you to to take from

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,839
this is that you have compulsory school

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:40,480
that is uh nine years

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,399
and that is from ages seven to fifteen

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,240
and then you have upper secondary school

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,360
which isn't compulsory

00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,800
but most actually

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,480
do continues to study and that is 16 to

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,040
19 years of age

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,839
and after that you go on to university

00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,800
or

00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,480
some other higher vocational education

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,160
and that could be

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,839
i mean two years to become a network

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,639
technician or

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,279
three years to become a network engineer

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:12,320
or

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:15,760
anything in there between so

00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:19,040
i am situated in the middle of this

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:22,639
map in upper secondary school

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:27,199
in sweden it's called gymnosiet and it's

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:29,440
actually a name derived from a gymnasium

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,959
but it's the original meaning of the

00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,399
word

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:38,000
so up under secondary school ages

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:41,440
say 16 to 19

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,800
that is the late teens students are

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,600
discovering the world in a way that they

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,639
haven't done

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,800
earlier in their education

00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,800
and these three years they have the

00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,800
possibility to

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:59,839
choose what kind of education they want

00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,839
so we have

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:07,360
20 30 whatever how many there are

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,120
programs or or education that they can

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:14,000
choose between

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:17,600
and i i teach on one of those

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,880
programs so i'm teaching mainly as i

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,880
mentioned web development

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,680
all right so the government has made it

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,199
possible

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:32,399
to teach about free and open source

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:34,720
in the upper secondary school there are

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,240
room for that and there are

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,800
possibilities to talk about it

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:43,839
if you look at stuff like um

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,759
the curriculum for the individual

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,560
courses

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,440
but it is the municipalities that

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,880
actually

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:56,079
are behind and sponsor and

00:15:52,880 --> 00:16:00,800
take care of the these schools

00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:04,079
so we have 290 municipalities in sweden

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:07,600
who try to do their best and

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:12,320
each municipality buy their own software

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,320
and that is software from the cloud like

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,399
if we talk about the student platforms

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,160
learning platforms

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:23,759
but also what computers should be bought

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:27,360
and what software should be on them so

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:30,480
that isn't the best idea

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:35,040
because you don't have the competence

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,040
in most many municipalities to

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:42,240
do to

00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,360
find good software

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,800
rather you hear something from

00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:51,839
your friend on the golf course from the

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,120
next municipality over and then you go

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:57,199
with what he

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:57,680
says so we are have been stuck with a

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,199
lot of

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,519
bad software through the years and a lot

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,720
of

00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,760
the reason for that is that the

00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,319
municipalities

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,360
doesn't have the competence as the

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,839
scientist

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:15,439
mentions in the quote here that i found

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,439
in a magazine just last week

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,439
teachers are if it's like hurting cats

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,760
to

00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,760
administer programmers well

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,039
it's like hurting kittens i don't know

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,640
what's worse actually

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:35,120
because teachers are so set in their

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,120
ways

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:42,240
10 years ago we

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,240
made a

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:50,080
we tried to implement open office at

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:53,280
our school and the idea was that well

00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:55,760
we have a lot of money to save going

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,880
from microsoft office

00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,039
and they actually went

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,000
as far as rolling out open office on all

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,120
the pupils

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,400
computers but not on the teacher's

00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,679
computers

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,720
why well because a handful of teachers

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:15,919
had some excel sheets

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:19,520
with some sort of programming

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:22,320
in them that they had used for 10 years

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,160
and they would never under any

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,760
circumstances

00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:31,120
be able to translate that to

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:34,080
open office and since they didn't have

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,960
the same functionality and the

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,799
differences that

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:42,480
microsoft implemented there were so

00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:44,960
many problems with the students and the

00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,280
teachers not having the same software

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,400
that the next year they rolled out

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,400
microsoft office again

00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:57,440
but it's not hopeless i mean we had

00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,320
the pandemic now and from one day to the

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,600
other

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:05,600
almost all teachers seamlessly

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:08,799
went over to teaching their

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:12,160
courses via zoom or

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,960
teams or whatever with the kids being

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,760
home

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:21,360
and so there is a possibility for

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:24,720
change but it's hard to see what

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:28,240
makes it possible

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:31,760
so how do how do we in this

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:34,960
environment approach this then

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,600
well the we these are two of my closest

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,799
colleagues

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:42,400
on the screen and we talk a lot about

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:44,799
how to get these students who

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,520
have never even thought about licensing

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,960
before

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,400
how to get them to understand foss in a

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,760
good way

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,840
and the first year when they arrive we

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,640
don't get in touch with them that much

00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,120
because neither one of us have

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,559
any courses with the first years

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,679
unfortunately

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:08,080
but the library

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,000
at our school does a good job of

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,840
introducing creative commons

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:18,720
to them so the library visits

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,720
all the classes in year one and they

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,039
explain how creative commons works and

00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,440
how do you how you find

00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,559
works that are released under such a

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,760
license

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,679
so that is a first taste of it

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,880
and then in second year then they come

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,400
to me and

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:39,679
and study the course web development one

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:44,080
and also a base

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:45,679
a primary basic computer course

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,200
like this is a screen this is a

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,799
processor this is

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:54,880
this is what makes up a computer etc

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:56,880
and then we really try to give them

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,960
as much as they can handle from the

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,080
start so we actually begin

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:06,799
with how to become a hacker by uh

00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:09,840
esr and talk about the hacker ethos and

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:12,640
what's what what started and what

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,880
was the foundation for what later become

00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,080
the

00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:18,880
the first movement and this idea

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,600
that you shouldn't reinvent the wheel

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,559
and

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,919
it's always better if we actually

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:27,360
collaborate

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:30,080
to create software and which

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,640
has been proven by now you would think

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,600
that

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,720
it is actually a better way to produce

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,440
software

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,559
and this we introduced them to as well

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,960
as

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,960
great examples of software being

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:47,200
developed that way like

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:49,760
inkscape and virtualbox 7zip

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,720
we talk a bit about linux as well as the

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,559
css

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:57,600
framework bootstrap but then we really

00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:02,640
dive into it in in the third year

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:06,480
where we talk about drupal of course we

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:09,840
give them the chance to try out

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:13,440
docker the lamp stack git and

00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:17,840
as they get in contact with

00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:20,320
software and they get in contact with

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,640
software that others have built in this

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,640
way

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:29,840
well it's still not easy but they

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,760
start to see and start to understand

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,840
why it is important and what the

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:37,679
benefits are

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:40,880
but then to say that they

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,840
actually become false enthusiasts well

00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,679
no

00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:48,799
no not at all perhaps one in 30

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:51,600
become an enthusiast and

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:53,360
enters the free and open source

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:58,559
community

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,559
but otherwise i would say um

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:09,280
the main student body they listen

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,400
and puts it away somewhere in their mind

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,640
and

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,640
and then it's not very important anymore

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,120
the big problem for us as teachers i

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,840
think

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:27,120
is to make it not seem hard

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:29,679
to set up docker and

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,760
a lamp stack and drupal virtual

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:35,200
container

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:38,400
and start collaborating with code on git

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,520
github or or similar i mean

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:44,559
for us it's easy because

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,000
drupal i mean sorry docker is simpler

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,679
than vagrant was

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,400
and vagrant was much better than what we

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:53,600
had before and so on

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:57,159
but for them coming to this from nowhere

00:23:53,600 --> 00:24:00,400
not really understanding

00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:02,840
virtualization neither

00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,960
full virtualization or container

00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:09,360
virtualization

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:12,240
they struggle and

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,679
it's hard for me to make sure that their

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,760
struggle

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,960
doesn't leave them with a bad taste in

00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,400
their mouths

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:24,799
regarding drupal or foss

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,799
when the problem is perhaps that

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,360
they should have

00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:33,200
[Music]

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,559
the problem lies in the infrastructure i

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,640
think

00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,600
and perhaps we are trying to teach them

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,000
too much

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,159
perhaps we are too enthusiastic perhaps

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,600
we shouldn't give them

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:49,440
the docker treatment but already

00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:52,720
made container in kubernetes or

00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:56,159
equivalent and just let them build

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,640
there but it is still a part of

00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:01,120
what we are supposed to teach them they

00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:04,799
are supposed to learn about these stuff

00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:06,400
these things and if they go out to a

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:09,360
company

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,159
search for a job which they can't do

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,440
after

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,000
the three years with us they will find

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,760
companies that

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,279
work with these technologies all the

00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:21,039
time i have

00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:22,960
acquaintances in the force community and

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,679
in the web development community

00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,720
and we have visited them at their

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,640
companies and we

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,720
asked about what kind of stacks they use

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:35,120
what kind of software they use

00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:39,600
and we really try to use the same things

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:44,640
when we educate our students

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,640
so the biggest

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,159
problems that the biggest

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:56,000
thresholds we have to pass to

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:59,200
get the growing generation to understand

00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,480
and accept foss is

00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,799
obscurity as a as it ever has been as it

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,600
has been for since forever

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,880
they simply don't know it exists or why

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,720
they should care

00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:15,919
and the other is that it sort of

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:19,360
is moving out of reach into the cloud

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:21,679
and that way they never get in contact

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:24,960
with it

00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:27,679
or that teachers and municipalities

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,159
in sweden at least and i guess it's the

00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,080
same in

00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:32,640
most of europe simply doesn't have the

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,480
knowledge

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,799
needed to leave the safe bosom of

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:43,200
microsoft and adobe

00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:46,320
and introduce the alternatives

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:49,440
and also that

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:52,480
not all the software is as polished

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,360
as it perhaps could be to make the

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,640
transition

00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:59,840
as easy as possible for the

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,640
students that is

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:04,960
what i've noticed and what i've

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,200
identified

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,000
shall we take some questions perhaps

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,000
thank you very much

00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,200
thank you kenneth uh that was a very

00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:19,200
interesting talk i have two kids myself

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,200
so i'm always curious about how in

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,120
german public school

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,200
so i'm always curious about how this is

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,360
done in other places we certainly

00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,799
have our fair share of similar problems

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,640
it sounds like

00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,080
uh especially when it comes to dealing

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,159
with uh

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,960
teachers with laptops and you know

00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:39,360
matching software with with students and

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,000
funding and networking and high-speed

00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,720
internet

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,399
and yes seems like seems like it's a

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,080
common problem

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,240
um there are there are no questions that

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,360
are coming up uh just yet but i actually

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,720
have a question

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,159
um for you based on the years that

00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,200
you've been doing this have you

00:27:54,159 --> 00:28:00,320
seen kids come back later

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,720
and say like hey i i really this was

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,600
really useful for me and in what context

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:08,080
was it useful for them um or did they

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,840
find that like it took them a lot longer

00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,600
to understand the fundamentals so that

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:16,080
they could get a grasp of

00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:19,840
why foss is important yes yes absolutely

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:23,120
i have met students that perhaps

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,520
five years later realize that

00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,960
wait a minute what kenneth taught me

00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,240
actually

00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,799
is something i i find useful now and it

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:37,440
actually is what people use and how

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:39,840
this how it works in in the real life

00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,039
so to speak that they didn't really make

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,480
the connection

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,960
when i was teaching them but later when

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,520
they

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,120
went out and got the job and so forth

00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,240
they found that

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,399
this is really how it works and this has

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,440
really helped me

00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:59,840
and we also

00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,039
we have students who stay for a fourth

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,960
year

00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,600
and they go out to a company and works

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,799
there

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,760
as a part of the curriculum and they

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,799
always come back

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,200
and tell us how much more

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:16,240
they know than even the people of the

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,520
company

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:22,559
because we are in the forefront of

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,880
what we teach and what which

00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:26,799
corresponds with what companies actually

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,799
need

00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:30,399
that's that sounds great that's really

00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,799
uh i mean it's impressive to see

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:34,000
uh to see all that coming back to you um

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,480
so there are a couple of questions that

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,440
have come

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,559
up as well um so one of them is from

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,039
your personal experience

00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,919
um was it that catches the interest of

00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,559
young people

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,559
for foss

00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,880
so you mentioned one in 30 was

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,360
enthusiastic

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,960
yeah i guess another way maybe it's like

00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,240
of the other students or of that for

00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,320
that enthusiast

00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:00,000
like what is it in particular about foss

00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:04,799
that sort of like really clicks for them

00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,799
i mean it's never it's not a gpl

00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:11,200
i i mean what they actually go for is

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,240
they discover vector graphics and

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,399
inkscape

00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:19,679
and realize how empowering that is

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:22,720
when they start to draw and create

00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:25,600
or blender or one of these

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,080
softwares that are a really good example

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,960
of

00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,760
foss it's the software that draws them

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,120
in

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:36,720
and it doesn't have to be much

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:39,840
i mean some only discovers linux

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,799
and i find that this does suit me much

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,840
better

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,720
and as soon as they appreciate the

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,440
software

00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,559
whatever it is the appreciation of foss

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:51,679
comes with it

00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,960
and then they start to in a small way

00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:55,200
evangelize

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,720
and discover or other pieces of software

00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,919
that helps them

00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,480
move forward yeah okay um

00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,000
so one other question is um what do you

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,200
feel open source projects could

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,640
do to make their projects more

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,760
interesting and accessible

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,120
to younger contributors and if there's

00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,880
anything

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,559
in particular to be aware of regarding

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,799
safeguarding

00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:20,799
i guess for young minds let's say

00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:28,720
i love the things that

00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:30,000
canonical has done i don't know if they

00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:33,279
do it anymore but

00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:39,120
when they pick bite-sized bugs

00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:42,640
to fix even if it's the documentation

00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:45,760
that i mean it of course every project

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,080
should focus on their software but also

00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,760
to

00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:51,840
have a look at the

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,200
instructions for that software to make

00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,919
it simple and easy

00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:58,080
to understand regardless of age because

00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:01,279
that's not that difficult

00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:04,320
to make sure that

00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:07,360
the video snippets that explain

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,960
one or other functionality is easy to

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,799
understand for everyone

00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,960
and also to include

00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:18,880
students and people who are trying to

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,799
learn programming or trying to

00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,720
get into the community to give them

00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:26,720
these small

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:29,919
ways to help and to contribute

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,679
i think that is very important okay so

00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,840
also contributions in terms of

00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,720
bug reports and improvements

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,760
documentation

00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:40,399
stuff like that absolutely and in terms

00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,480
of safeguarding

00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:43,519
and in terms of of safeguarding i mean

00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,080
keeping things

00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,600
in mind that these are you know 16 to 19

00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,679
year olds

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,640
you know should projects consider like a

00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,360
special section

00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,240
of documentation for a younger audience

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,399
is there anything

00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,559
else in mind that you would like open

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:03,039
source projects to be doing

00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:07,120
in that sense i feel that that would put

00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:10,559
too great a strain on the project okay

00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:14,159
i think and i i these are

00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:16,799
students that are surprisingly mature in

00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,840
the way that they handle technology they

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,880
aren't

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:21,200
strangers to reading manuals and such i

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,120
mean

00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,440
they have grown up with it in a way that

00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:29,440
we haven't

00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,919
so i think that to make them a special

00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,279
place

00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:37,840
no it's not necessary but uh

00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:40,480
of course it's better to put that

00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,080
work in that time into making sure that

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,840
the ordinary

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:49,120
documentation and the ordinary um

00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:52,240
visible places of the project is

00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:56,080
as polished as can be yeah

00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:57,440
makes sense okay uh

00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,279
so someone was asking thinking more

00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,399
about uh regarding that question

00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,720
about uh the last one was thinking more

00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:04,880
about

00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,960
child safety so working one-on-one with

00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,560
adults from around the world fully

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,480
digitally so let's say they're they're

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,919
collaborating with someone and

00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,839
you know someone asked to do a video

00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:16,879
chat or something like this so keep in

00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:17,520
in mind that there are youth uh any

00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:20,480
ideas

00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,599
as this as this ever happened um any any

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,119
ideas for maybe

00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:28,000
ways to safeguard kids

00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,720
we have been blessed in not having that

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,240
problem

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:35,760
and a part of that is that since they

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:38,879
only start learning programming year two

00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:42,079
they are not there until year three

00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:45,760
and that's when they turn 18. okay

00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:48,800
so and then the rules are

00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,000
a bit different and it's so well

00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,560
it's more or less their own

00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,240
responsibility right of course we

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,240
always try to warn them about the

00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,480
problems that can exist

00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,160
yeah do you find that at that age when

00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,000
kids are coming in

00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,359
uh they already have some experience

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,280
understanding

00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,800
by the from their other teachers or from

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,400
their parents how

00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,040
you know how to be safe on the internet

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,800
is this sort of a common

00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:16,880
well-known uh common knowledge or

00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,079
is it still i'm curious as well for

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,480
myself what do i have to do to prepare

00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,480
my kids

00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:26,240
10 years ago i started teaching

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,720
12 years ago but 10 years ago i had a

00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:30,000
class

00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:33,359
where 17 year old

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,560
girl were she had her own blog

00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:38,560
and she was frequently posting pictures

00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:41,839
of herself in a bikini and

00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:44,960
scantily clad and i took up i took this

00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:48,560
as an example in class

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:51,760
to make them see that you don't know who

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:54,560
who's watching this and

00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,839
i don't feel that any one of my students

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,960
would do that

00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:02,079
today so something has changed these

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:05,920
this last decade and i think that

00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:09,520
the educational system has caught up now

00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:27,839
and i at least hope that is

00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:27,839
because they have been probably warned

00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,200
