	00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,000
as

00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,559
as advertised i'm going to talk about

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,240
building and managing communities

00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,679
but i also want to acknowledge that

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,840
communities of

00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,200
uh open source projects are very

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,520
different today than they were

00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,039
even five years ago or 10 years ago or

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,199
20 years ago

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,039
so there is a conversation to be had

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,000
about how did we get here

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,480
and where do we want to go from here so

00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,279
i've

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,000
brought together two different types of

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,440
talks here

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,880
and i want to get your feedback on

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,719
all of this information and so on so

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,840
please liberally use the chat

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,480
liberally use the emoji reactions and

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,280
come have a conversation with me after

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,840
this

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,840
so how did we get to this state in

00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,960
community life right now

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,640
and how did we how do we want to move

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,680
forward

00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,879
so one of the things that i think is

00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,160
very important is to realize that your

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,840
communities

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,159
are the people that are in them they

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,760
are the communities they they are the

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,360
communities that are built

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,680
by the people that are participating in

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,920
them and this if this isn't an argument

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,240
for more diversity inside your project

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,200
and more perspectives and more views

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,640
inside your project

00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,960
i cannot possibly see a better one

00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,840
we want our open source community these

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,159
communities to be open and inclusive

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,360
and that means that the people who are

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,680
active in them

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,439
have to look like the people we are also

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,880
trying to attract

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,000
i don't know how many of you know ross

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,720
gardler he uh is a longtime apache

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,119
person

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,479
and was one of their leadership and on

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,040
their board for a long time

00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,159
and this was just a great offhand quote

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,520
that he said

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:57,680
uh in a meeting and it was it was

00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,119
too good to leave there so

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,600
if this is our starting point the

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,280
community is the people that is

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,200
that are inside it and the people who

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,399
are most active and that's what sets the

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,440
culture

00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,160
then for those of you who are part of

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,280
uh us culture you should be able to

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,959
recognize this

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,560
there we go now and clicked on the

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,080
correct

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,040
window you should be able to recognize

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,120
this gentleman this is john f kennedy

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,239
and in one of his most famous speeches

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,040
he said ask

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,840
not what you can do for your country or

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,400
ask not what your country can do for you

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,000
but what you can do for your country and

00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,840
that in a lot of cases

00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,200
is how you have to start your engagement

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,319
in communities

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:44,000
so many of you are open source community

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:46,319
long time contributors developers uh

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,840
people who are working on the project in

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,800
other roles that

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,519
may be broader than just committing code

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,599
and

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,760
all of these contributions all of this

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,239
that you are doing for your community

00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,040
is what actually creates it community by

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,480
itself

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,640
is just a word community is the people

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,920
that are inside it

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:11,280
so how do we go from here

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,280
and what do we want to do about it

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,239
first and absolutely everyone of you who

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,760
are here

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,560
in this conversation today know this

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,159
first you have to show up there's a

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,879
really fun story here because

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,440
early in my career i knew that i needed

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,360
to go to

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,519
meetups and i knew i needed to get into

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,040
this community thing and this networking

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,319
thing because i needed to meet more

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,599
people

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:43,360
and i'm an introvert totally admit it

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:46,720
and i hated them

00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:49,760
i hated going to meetups i hated um

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,840
i hated having to go in schmooze and

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,959
i realized that i didn't feel as if i

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,280
had a place

00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:57,680
or a part in any of these communities or

00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,080
in any in any of these groups

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,360
and so i would cancel or i'd get a

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,239
little bit anxious and i wouldn't want

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,439
to go

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,439
and or occasionally i will admit i got

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,280
to the venue it was too much of a hassle

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,400
to park i went home

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:17,120
so these are the kinds of resistances

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:20,479
that we find to showing up so in my case

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,160
i am a chronic hand raiser so i decided

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,320
that i would run these meetups

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,800
because if i had a responsibility and i

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,280
had a thing i needed to do

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,120
then i would be there and i would do my

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,400
thing and then i would have reasons to

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,080
talk to people

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,080
so this is a super cool excuse to get

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,520
people involved in your project

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,960
recognize that they're there

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,800
recognize that they may feel as if

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,960
they're an outsider they may not

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,919
understand how they fit and give them a

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,160
job

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,919
it's so straightforward and it makes

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,120
people feel so

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,680
deeply included and deeply seen it may

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,960
feel

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,960
awkward or it may feel

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,520
to actually say hey uh

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,120
can i get you to go do this thing or

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,759
would you review these slides or this

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,039
document

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:12,560
in our non-uh physical world but

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:14,240
that outreach can be huge because

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,720
for people who aren't automatically a

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,120
hand raiser if you can go out and tap

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,199
them

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,759
and say hey you have a place in this

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:26,400
community i need your help here

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,400
then you draw them in that much further

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,000
another piece of

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,759
learning that i have taken away from my

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,479
years in community is

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,080
on top of making sure i show up and

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,199
finding whatever way it is

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,360
that gets me to show up

00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,400
you also need to develop values for that

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,560
community

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,479
and these aren't the sort of touchy

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,639
feely snuggly values i really just

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,800
wanted to use that image

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,560
but these are values that you as a

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,039
company or as a project

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,160
or as a company can use to make your

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,360
decisions

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,240
so they aren't you know we we believe in

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,240
integrity

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,319
okay but really who doesn't and if you

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,720
didn't believe in integrity would you

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,720
actually put that on your website like

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,919
this just doesn't seem

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,759
same to me so let's develop values for

00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,720
your community or your project

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,000
that you can use to make decisions i

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,720
give an example here because

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,280
it's straightforward um the values that

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:27,360
the kubernetes community devised

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,800
and this is a lot through the organic

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,560
growth of the community and how the

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,000
community was acting

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:36,400
that we then chose to codify as values

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,039
and these are our values it's pretty

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,440
straightforward we actually say

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,560
if i need to make a decision is the

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,479
community

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,000
the the children you know how is the

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,479
community affected in this choice and

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,479
how is

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,080
the single company of maybe this

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,520
decision or the group of companies that

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,080
may be involved in this decision how are

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,160
they

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,280
engaged because in large scale projects

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,840
you're not always

00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,400
working just with individuals you're

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,440
often

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,199
working with companies or the vps behind

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,120
the people that you're talking to

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,639
and you don't always understand their

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,039
motivations or their

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,639
engagement and how they want to

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,000
participate in this

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:17,039
but you as an in an individual

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,319
working in your open source community

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:23,520
have that trust and authenticity

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,360
and transparency passing through

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,039
you and your credibility and

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,240
responsibility

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:33,199
are part of this conversation

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,919
as well so our first value when making

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,599
choices

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,360
if it's a choice between doing something

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,280
that provides more value for the

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,440
community or more value for a single

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,240
company or a small group of companies

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,400
we choose the community we choose to

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,440
make all of our work distributed instead

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,759
of centralized

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,639
and that in this case means our decision

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,639
making as well

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,240
so within kubernetes early early on

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,400
the decisions were all blocked and gated

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,319
on what would google answer or how can i

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:03,199
find the right googler to say yes to

00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,759
this

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,280
and that really was damaging to the

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,199
community

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,879
how many of you have been stuck in a

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,639
position or a

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,960
community where you can't quite find

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,160
the can't quite find the right person to

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,360
ask for permission

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,360
except that maybe you don't need

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,960
permission but it's not clear okay

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,639
emojis again

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,280
please let me know over on the other

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:30,479
screen i bet some of you have

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,800
felt this kubernetes also said that

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,240
improvement is better than stagnation so

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,560
we're not always going to get it right

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,279
not every change is going to be right

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,000
but

00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,200
waiting and sitting still is also not an

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,080
option

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,360
and then of course um having come out of

00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,160
google and with the

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,120
super strong sre background there

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,000
automation

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,560
is better than toil where toil equals a

00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,959
process in a human doing something

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,000
so these are our decision-making

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,080
criteria

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,839
should we put this patch in let's go

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,080
back does it look at does it

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,440
react or does the community benefit more

00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,360
than the company or does the company

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,800
benefit more than the community

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,880
are we moving to make this more

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,360
decentralized and distributed

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,600
are we moving to make this a better

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,240
project and are we always trying to find

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,600
places to automate and reduce toil

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,519
so those were our values that we

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,480
developed and we didn't do this in a

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,440
brainstorming

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,720
thinking session we did this as a

00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,880
community

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,839
the first year or so as we worked

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,600
together we

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,120
were finding these values we were

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,800
finding what was important to the

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,360
community

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,240
and then we had to codify it and

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,800
sometimes

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,959
we didn't get to see those things or see

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,680
what made the community special

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,920
until we talked to people who felt as if

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,720
they weren't part of that community

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,640
and saw what they aspired to saw what

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,440
they wanted from the community

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,880
asked them what was important to them

00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,120
asked them

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,640
how we could better support them in the

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,600
community

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,720
and then making sure that that feedback

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,839
is incorporated

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,839
over and over and over

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,920
because incorporating that feedback is

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,680
one of the behaviors

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,200
that you really want to reward in open

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,560
source

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:24,320
open source is this fantastic

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:27,600
uh space world uh

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,800
culture that is very different

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,000
from a classic corporate culture or even

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,920
a social culture

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,160
it's kind of somewhere between which is

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,160
very neat and we're incredibly lucky to

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,160
be able to work in that space

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,560
but that also means that you don't have

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:46,320
many of the traditional

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,240
motivators so most of the people that i

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,800
find in open source

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,560
are either better at intrinsic

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,160
motivation motivation coming up from

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,600
inside themselves

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,120
or have learned like myself how to put

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,160
that intrinsic motivation

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,760
in there by volunteering to relieve the

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,240
meetup for example

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,320
now i have an extrinsic motivation i

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,680
need to be there to open the doors or

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,640
there is no meetup

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:16,240
so i'll be there but you want to reward

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,240
the behaviors that you want to encourage

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,200
so if you see someone you know stepping

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,399
up and triaging

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:26,560
uh issues without being asked

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,519
that's the kind of thing not to just say

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,079
wow thanks

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,360
susie you did a great job coming in and

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:35,600
working on that

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:38,560
but to say to the whole of the community

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,200
this was an excellent act of leadership

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,440
she

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,880
may have you know feedback after having

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,600
gone through and done this great

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,160
you know triage work and maybe we can

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,360
set up

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:52,160
a group that can work on this more often

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,560
going forward there's a great ruth peter

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,160
ginsberg quote around this which is

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,600
fight for the things that you find

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,720
important but

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:03,360
do it in a way that others will join you

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,760
i also talk about this as the tom sawyer

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,800
hook

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,600
finn um fence painting act in open

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,519
source

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,680
in open source when you're super excited

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:15,079
about things and you can relate

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:18,079
and participate and engage with someone

00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:18,720
empathetically you can actually find

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,760
ways

00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:25,360
that align your interests with theirs

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,320
and get a better outcome for the whole

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,560
project

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,240
you can align interests you develop

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,000
things together you have those different

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,720
perspectives coming in you're being

00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,839
empathetic

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:39,519
everybody is feeling as if they're

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,360
safe in this space and

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,920
you get lots of productivity this is the

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,959
whole one plus one doesn't equal two

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,360
aspect of open source because if i

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,639
sat and developed a thing or wrote a

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,079
thing all by myself

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,399
and then tried to publish it on the web

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,839
having done this in in english not your

00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,680
traditional coding language but having

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,720
done this in english a number of times

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,959
i always value the

00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,800
feedback that i get from my peers and

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,279
the empathy with which they give it to

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,600
me

00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,360
so that i can learn and grow and that

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,839
makes the whole

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,160
procedure and the whole process of

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:19,040
creating content or developing a product

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,760
or negotiating how we're going to market

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,399
something

00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,760
among different companies all of that

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,880
requires empathy

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,120
and requires that we are focused on

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,880
the people that we're working with as

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,920
well as

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,920
the project outcomes it's also the whole

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,920
point in the kubernetes value of the

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,160
community needs to be

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,160
first before the company in order to

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:46,079
make sure that the project as a whole

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,920
is strong saying all that

00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:51,360
you really also need to make space for

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,360
creativity in your community

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,800
this can happen in a number of ways in

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:59,199
the most mundane way

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,360
one of the places open source falls down

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:04,800
in comparison to proprietary

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:08,399
project product is

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:11,120
in fact that we have worst ui in ux

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,920
so how about we start embracing creative

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,079
designers

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,720
and embracing people who can work with

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:20,160
us on on ui flow because not

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:23,519
every end user is going to have the same

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:26,160
concept and comfort with the ui

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,480
that may be perfectly intuitive to the

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,639
person who wrote it

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,320
so that's one aspect of making space for

00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:35,519
creativity making sure that we

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,160
bring creatives who can help us make

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,440
our projects even more appealing and

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,320
even more

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,920
uh intuitive and useful decreasing mean

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,199
time to dopamine the first time you're

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,040
playing with the project

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,120
make space for those people in our

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,560
projects make space for the

00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,680
the visual and the um participatory for

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,519
our customers

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,360
or for our end users and then of course

00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,079
there's another aspect which is make

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,920
space for creativity and fun within the

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,760
community

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:07,120
in the second half of my talk i'm gonna

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,920
actually offer a couple

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,519
of examples of that and how it happened

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,279
spontaneously in the kubernetes

00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:16,720
community because we made space

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:18,320
for it so of course you've worked in

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:22,160
open source long enough

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:25,519
you know that offering help

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,120
and participating with your community

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,839
engaging with them

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,120
and encouraging them as opposed to

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,320
shutting them down

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:37,440
is always the best path toward

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:40,480
a happy healthy community that

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,279
then through example begins

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,320
helping and growing other people in the

00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,360
project

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:49,360
so for every one of the people that you

00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,800
take under your wing as a leader in an

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,800
open source project

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,560
and you coach and you mentor a little

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,399
bit and you empower

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,680
more than anything that you empower them

00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,320
in the project

00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:01,839
those people become our next generation

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,680
of contributors

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,320
those people become our next generation

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:09,199
of leaders and that

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,240
is the best legacy that we can leave a

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,959
project

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,079
is making sure that we are not central

00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,480
to it

00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,519
i as an individual never wanted to be

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,759
central to the

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,040
kubernetes community it was occasionally

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,480
the person that said oh you have to

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,680
connect you those two people have to

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,160
connect or whatever

00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,600
but i never wanted to be the only person

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,120
that could do a thing

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,600
or the only person who could make a

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,759
decision and that

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,800
through empowerment of everyone around

00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:40,160
you is the biggest help

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:43,199
for your project to develop succession

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:47,120
good leadership a strong bench

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:51,839
in case someone gets ill and more

00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,839
resilient as a project

00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:57,199
to that end since we are presuming we

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,279
are not forever going to be leading the

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:02,079
project that we're working on right now

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,440
or we're not forever going to be uh

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,839
working on the project that we're

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:09,039
leading now

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:11,360
there has to be a way to document

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,559
decision making some projects run

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,720
decision records

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,319
just if the just if a decision is made

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,000
it gets written down in a decision

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,280
record and who was there the time when

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,240
the decision was made

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,360
this accountability is incredibly

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,799
important

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:29,360
i've used this same image on a slide

00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,559
before to talk about shadowy power

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,240
structures

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:36,000
and that is very much why you want to be

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,600
documenting decision making

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
it's very much why you want to

00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:42,720
understand who can make decisions

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,200
and when something is just a decision

00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,080
for

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,280
the community to discuss and and come to

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,039
consensus

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,360
because of course open source on the

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:55,600
whole runs by consensus

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,600
acceptor until you run into a bdfl

00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,919
okay so this is another thing that

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,600
should be pretty straightforward to you

00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:05,280
all measure what matters

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:08,640
use that information to go ahead and

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:11,600
improve your project and

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,799
seek out new perspectives where you know

00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,919
you're not having

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:18,720
and meeting the needs of your users

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,799
by whatever measurement or key objective

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,840
you've set

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:27,039
within open source of course

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,120
i like to set up my projects so that no

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:32,640
matter who's participating in them

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,880
they're being stretched in a way that

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,320
is not comfortable to them because that

00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,640
discomfort

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,840
is learning in a lot of cases i'm not

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,559
saying make people

00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,280
feel uncomfortable that's different but

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,200
i'm saying

00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,440
make sure that people are not only being

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,559
an

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:53,039
expert and offering uh you know

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:55,280
experiences from the past and exp you

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,559
know offering the wisdom of my years in

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,400
this open source

00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,080
but that they're also growing that

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,799
they're also learning

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,360
in kubernetes in a lot of cases we were

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,080
working

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,720
on what fundamentally was management

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,960
skills

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,720
in some of the leadership uh

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,640
conversations we were working on

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,240
negotiation skills

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,400
you know you bring a bunch of staff

00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,760
suites together there's nothing in

00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,960
leading a project

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,200
that i'm going to teach them about

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,640
engineering but

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,559
it turns out the community isn't made of

00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,840
just code it's actually made of

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,880
engineers and

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,120
engineers still need to be thought of

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:37,440
and engaged with as a whole person

00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:40,400
so there's a huge need to make sure that

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,039
your your team your leadership and your

00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,720
project

00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:48,559
broadly are always always learning

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:50,240
and then teaching because it is so much

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,400
harder to teach

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,720
something than it is to think you know

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:58,080
you understand it

00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:00,080
so i recommend the next time you think

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:04,080
you really understand a topic

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:06,720
in your code or in your community

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,840
find a find a partner find a rubber duck

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,360
to talk to

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:14,000
and say let me explain this to you

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,559
because to try to deconstruct things in

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:21,200
a lot of cases in order to explain them

00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:23,440
you will learn more and more

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,640
funny aside there i'm taking pilates

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,039
teacher training

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,799
so that i can deepen my own pilates

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,360
practice because i'm being taught how to

00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,840
teach it

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:35,840
which means that i'm now learning even

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,840
better how to do it

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,520
another thing that we have to value and

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,120
reward

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,799
in that whole point about valuing and

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,840
rewarding the things that we

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:49,360
find important is doing

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:52,720
unglamorous work this is

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:55,840
the make or break point for your

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,559
community because if there is not a

00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,520
culture

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,720
of doing the work that just needs to be

00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,440
done

00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,480
setting up cicd making sure there's test

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,679
coverage

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,159
making sure that the meetings are set up

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:13,280
for the next week and there's an agenda

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:16,000
making sure that the discussion points

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,440
um have been you know discussion points

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,360
around the technical

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,440
uh choices you're going to make have

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,840
been vetted inside your company as well

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,159
as

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,159
the the negotiation you know in

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,760
preparation for the negotiation

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:32,559
uh with the project but this

00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,919
this is the thing that can actually kill

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:37,280
your project because

00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,720
it can erode from the center if you're

00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,760
not doing

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,799
the maintenance work that is just

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,400
gardening it's great if you want to go

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,720
out to your garden and you want to put

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,760
in

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,280
a whole new plant bed

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,440
and you're all set up in the beginning

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,400
of spring and that looks all super shiny

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,480
and cool

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,840
and then you have a garden open house

00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,679
and then you have some neighbors come

00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,039
through and then you invite more people

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,240
and you're working with more people in

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,120
your garden and you're actually maybe

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,960
going to build

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,960
a fence because you can get your whole

00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,480
open source community to paint it for

00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:11,679
you

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,000
but by this point if you haven't also

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,720
been

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,039
maintaining that garden you know pulling

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,799
out the weeds making sure that the

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,480
issues are groomed wait now i'm mixing

00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:24,080
my metaphors making sure that

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:27,520
the beds of the plant beds are groomed

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:30,000
then you're not going to have a garden

00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,440
that is appealing for people to continue

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,440
to come work in

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,039
so you need to find those people and you

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,600
need to make sure that they are

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,320
rewarded and you need to make sure that

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,360
everyone

00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:44,559
is encouraged to do the hard work

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,360
that is maintenance of an open source

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,480
project

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:51,360
not the glamorous work of a release i

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,679
shouldn't say that releases a heavy lift

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,720
but not not the glamorous work of you

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,840
know the release

00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,240
blog post but the

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,080
or the new feature that you committed

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,240
but the heavy lifting work

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,520
and the the work that needs to be done

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,720
in every project

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,960
just to try to stay ahead of the jungle

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,480
of

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,760
weeds and decay that happens to our code

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,120
as well

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:17,120
and our project more broadly

00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:22,000
so i talk a lot i talked a lot about

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:26,400
culture

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:30,880
in this bit how to set it

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:34,320
how to engage with it how your community

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,880
will participate in your project and how

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,400
you can

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:42,080
engage with them and that i think

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:46,000
is such a stronger and more important

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:51,360
underpinning than necessarily having

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:55,520
a strategy that you can elucidate

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:59,200
all of that said strategy is important

00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:02,840
strategy in your project is going to be

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:06,320
necessary you need to understand what

00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:08,559
your companies who are participating

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,960
want you need to align interests you

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,080
need to leapfrog and think where this

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,960
project might be

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,360
in five years you need to look to where

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,159
that

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,799
goes you need to build like a cone of

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,320
projection

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,919
into the future and say if we're

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,720
starting from here

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,760
at the apex of the cone and we're trying

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,840
to go there

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:32,640
somewhere out in you know time

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,480
how do we make that navigation we know

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,559
it won't be the perfect path

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,760
so how do we keep ourselves bounded

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:42,880
within that strategic direction

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:46,000
that's super important

00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,320
but i think sometimes people confuse

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,320
the strategy of the project with the

00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,120
governance of the project

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,559
and the people spend a lot of time on

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,679
building the rules

00:24:54,559 --> 00:25:01,840
around your project and making sure

00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,840
that those rules are

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,880
game proof which they never will be and

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,880
especially in a group of engineers who

00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,640
are built to problem solve if i say you

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,159
can't game this metric

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,120
what is the first thing you're all going

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,480
to go do

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,440
you're going to go try to find a way to

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,039
gain the metric because it's fine

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,320
someone told me i couldn't do a thing

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,000
someone told me it was a problem they

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:27,840
hadn't solved

00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,559
so i propose a new framing on this

00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,760
culture

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:35,440
quote culture

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,440
eats governance for breakfast

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,080
if any of you have any thoughts on this

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,720
i'm happy to hear them on twitter

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,159
i'm happy to hear them with emoji in the

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,960
in this um

00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:49,039
video like i'm i'm just actually excited

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,320
about this is a fun way to describe this

00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:57,440
but here's the thing if you don't

00:25:52,320 --> 00:26:00,720
have trust in your organization

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:03,279
you won't have a good project

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,960
your project in your community will be

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:09,520
fraught

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:12,720
it may be an exceptional technical tool

00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:15,919
but it may be massively toxic

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,960
it may be the most

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:21,919
accommodating community that never

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,120
ends up getting anything done there has

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:27,039
to be space

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:30,720
for trust and that trust is often given

00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:33,919
before you have reason to know for sure

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,840
it's one of the reasons that the graph

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,080
that exists within open source is so

00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,039
important

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,919
if i have someone who calls me up and

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,240
says

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:46,000
so you worked with this person on

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,200
another project

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,240
how was that and i can offer my

00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,799
thoughts to offer commutative trust to

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,880
offer

00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:59,919
my my level of trust with that person

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,480
to the person who is making the inquiry

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:05,120
who then can say with you know however

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,919
however high their confidence in my

00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,480
perception is they can sort of put that

00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,679
value

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:14,000
on what my perception is of the person

00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,240
and you know maybe get a little leg up

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,760
on trusting them earlier because i trust

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,120
that person

00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:23,760
so trust is one of the huge like largest

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,600
underpinnings of open source communities

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,600
without that trust

00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,919
you're not going to be able to have a

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:33,120
successful project

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:37,919
and i want to say respect as well

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,919
and respect the noun here because

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:46,880
if we are not comfortable

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:50,480
and accepting and even embracing

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:53,679
the different views of people

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,520
as having value

00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,200
just by different view and something we

00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:01,600
can learn from

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:05,039
then we will be limiting and narrowing

00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:08,240
our possibility to make a better

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:11,440
more inclusive more um

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,320
broadly applicable project and that may

00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,320
be a goal

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,919
let's be clear there are totally times

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,679
when what you want to do is open source

00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,640
a tiny little library you're willing to

00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,200
run it for

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,159
on your own for you know the next 10

00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,679
years

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:28,399
and that's great but we also find

00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,520
that some of those tiny little libraries

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,399
end up

00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:35,279
in infrastructure and end up

00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:37,679
unmaintained many many years later

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,960
i think one of the classic examples that

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,799
we talk about is

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,600
uh ntp which there's a great article

00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,640
where

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:49,200
the primary contributor who has run this

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,320
on his own little machine workstation

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:55,760
under his desk for like 30 years

00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:58,960
his development his code his

00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:02,080
project are

00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:05,120
not as well engaged with or funded

00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:08,159
but the internet runs on ntp

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,120
how else without clock sync could we

00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,960
talk about

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,559
distributed compute i'm sure there's

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,320
another technical way

00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,720
i would love to hear about it throw it

00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:18,320
in the comments

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,399
and actually i think i do know what that

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,840
answer is but that's cool so respect is

00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:25,120
a noun we need

00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:27,679
to make sure that we have due regard

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,480
for the people and for the feelings and

00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,720
wishes

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,799
and the rights and traditions of others

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:37,440
around us

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:40,320
so we can also use it to say respect man

00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,760
that i want to draw a particular

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:45,279
attention to that

00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:48,240
lots of respect so that's the noun

00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:49,679
but as it turns out we aren't static as

00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,039
humans

00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,559
and so i want to introduce one more noun

00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:59,440
that participates in this whole

00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:59,440
conversation and that's vulnerability

00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:07,679
we have to make it okay

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,360
in our communities to have a

00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,399
conversation

00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:14,240
to disagree and to still come to a

00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:17,600
conclusion

00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:21,360
we have to be able to in our communities

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:24,720
say i was hurt by that

00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,799
can we look at doing it a different way

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,159
now hurt in this case maybe any number

00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:31,760
of things it may be

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:35,120
i wasn't able to access your meetings

00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:38,799
because they were at you know

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,799
a.m my time every week

00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:44,640
that's a vulnerability and that's a

00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,919
that's a point that this person is

00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,320
saying is you know

00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:48,960
by asking is it possible to move these

00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,039
meetings

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,279
implicitly because that person didn't in

00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:57,039
saying that ask

00:30:53,279 --> 00:31:00,320
but by encouraging or offering that

00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:03,440
it would be easier if we could also

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,240
have meetings at different times that

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,200
person

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,399
has taken a risk talking to a project

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,440
leader

00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:13,840
talking to someone in the project saying

00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,480
you know i'm not able to do this

00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:18,080
because whatever the reason is whatever

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,080
this is

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:25,440
to say that takes vulnerability

00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:31,039
and that vulnerability has to be

00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,039
respected and this time i mean the verb

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:38,640
being able to engage with

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,919
the hard parts of our self yeah i can't

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,159
do something

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,760
or i'm scared because i don't know who

00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:47,200
to talk to

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,320
or i have to understand and engage with

00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,720
a new project

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,600
but i don't know anyone there there is

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,480
so

00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:59,760
much activation energy

00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:02,320
in trying to get into and participating

00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:04,159
in a community

00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,760
think about the last time that you

00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,960
walked into a room

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:11,600
where you didn't know anyone

00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,360
and tried to have a conversation let's

00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,440
make it a big room let's pretend this is

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,519
before the pandemic

00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,880
so we'll make it we'll make it at an

00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,120
event

00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,320
we'll sit at this event we've got a nice

00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,919
little mixer going on

00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,679
and you're supposed to go meet all the

00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:27,440
people who are working on

00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,200
all the different i don't know service

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,200
meshes in the world so this should be

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,799
really interesting right

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:36,240
but it's also really scary especially if

00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,360
you don't know most of the people in the

00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,120
room

00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:41,279
i think some of us who work in open

00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,960
source regularly

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:47,760
forget how terrifying

00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,720
coming into a group that all knows each

00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:52,080
other

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:55,440
that is making inside jokes and that

00:32:52,080 --> 00:33:00,080
is behaving as

00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:01,600
a unit that's scary to be the person on

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,559
the outside

00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:07,039
so make sure that you can offer this

00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:09,919
verb of respect

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,720
seek out the qualities that are new in

00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:15,120
this person

00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:18,480
seek out how you they can participate

00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:21,440
show them that active respect

00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,240
learn from them where their strengths

00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,120
are

00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,159
and then get them to help the project

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,399
participate

00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,279
engage with them understand their needs

00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:31,039
align

00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,640
if they're aligned with the project see

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:35,120
if you can help them

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,679
and those needs as an individual might

00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,960
be

00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:40,720
career growth needs the way to get a

00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:43,279
company involved in a project

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,159
different thing they need different

00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:46,880
things

00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:48,640
but they still in all of these cases

00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,000
individual or company

00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:55,039
need to be looked at with

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,919
enough respect and enough distance that

00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:59,039
you can

00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,640
see where their value is see that

00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:02,880
the abilities that they have and the

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,039
qualities and achievements they've made

00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,679
that will benefit the project

00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,240
and it will benefit the community and

00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,599
then

00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:15,359
share those and share those in

00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:16,079
an admirative way admirative admiring

00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:19,119
way

00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:20,159
share them in a oh you need to connect

00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,159
with this person

00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,240
because they've been looking for your

00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,879
your type of skills

00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,320
way help them find their place in the

00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:32,639
community

00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:34,879
because of course people are messy

00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,760
and that includes everyone who is a

00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:37,440
leader

00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,599
that includes everyone who is showing up

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,639
for the first time with a first you know

00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:46,960
one character typo pull request

00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:49,839
humans are messy and so we have to spend

00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,720
i would argue as much or more time

00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:54,320
working

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:57,760
on making our projects work smoothly

00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,880
than making code and i'll i'll make this

00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,119
argument

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,599
and it's it's interesting because i've

00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:06,400
had this conversation a number of times

00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,839
inside companies as well as in open

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:12,079
source projects

00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:14,079
and one of the big challenges that

00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,079
people who have only worked within tight

00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,480
company organizations

00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,599
uh have done one of the challenges they

00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:23,400
have

00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:26,200
is that they are used to a whole lot of

00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:27,839
undocumented tribal knowledge

00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,240
expectations

00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:31,520
and framework around them when they come

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,560
to an open source project

00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,599
a lot of that is not there and that is

00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,720
uncomfortable

00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:41,839
so it causes people

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:44,160
to feel that discomfort and then we get

00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,640
back to people being messy and needing

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,040
to be

00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,839
respected and understood engaged with

00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,839
and empathized

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,280
so self-organization works for small

00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,000
groups um

00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:58,480
this is pretty straightforward you give

00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,359
a small group of you know six or eight

00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,680
or ten

00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:03,040
people who are participating in a

00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,079
breakout meet um

00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:08,240
meeting some autonomy and

00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,280
encourage them to do fun things and next

00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,680
thing you know you have

00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,800
hats happening in leadership in

00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,119
leadership meetings now

00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,480
this happened organically and i've seen

00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,240
it go wrong

00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,680
when it doesn't happen organically i

00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,760
once had a vp

00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,040
tell us that to his qbr we were all

00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,520
supposed to wear

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:28,240
crazy hats how many people do you think

00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:31,520
wore crazy hats

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,520
not even the vp

00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:38,400
so enforced fun is not fun organic fun

00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,920
is fun and you can self-organize to have

00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:44,000
organic fun

00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,280
self-organization does not work with a

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,000
power differential

00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:49,440
like this if this is the one thing that

00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,680
i have to

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,640
like drive home with you all

00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,720
self-organization

00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,839
doesn't work with a power differential

00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:59,280
so you really

00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:02,560
really need to make sure that you are

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,200
working with people and you are working

00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,240
with them

00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:09,520
as peers and working with them

00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:12,079
in the most collaborative way possible

00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,599
while also trying to break down and help

00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:17,280
them navigate

00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:20,560
a world that is not necessarily

00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:24,320
kind and not necessarily as good

00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:27,520
to all the people in in our world

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:30,400
as it should be so

00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,839
where there are power differentials men

00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:36,400
women

00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:39,440
black white big company startup

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:43,680
leader in the project or

00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:45,920
contributor to the project make sure

00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:48,720
make absolute sure that you do not

00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,599
presume what is going on in their head

00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,320
but that you ask and engage with them

00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,560
and you

00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,079
try to remove as much as possible that

00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,880
power dynamic

00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,920
because that power dynamic will have its

00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,680
own

00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:06,079
place at the table in that conversation

00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:08,160
so other things you should know clear

00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:09,280
ownership is empowering everybody loves

00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,960
this

00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,640
if you have a whole group of people that

00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,920
are given an action item

00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:18,960
is it going to get done this point in a

00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:21,720
regular keynote we'd all go no okay

00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:23,200
so realize that if you feel

00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,760
disenfranchised

00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,040
or you see commune community members who

00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,400
are super grumpy

00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,760
or if you know that there's work that

00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,400
could get done if the rules were

00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,000
different

00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,839
then there's actually a lot of

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,839
governance work that probably should be

00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:37,599
done

00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:39,119
but at that point it's not write the

00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,960
constitution

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,400
it's develop the minimum viable

00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,520
governance

00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:48,720
it's this simple

00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,560
write down what you're doing now

00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,560
know that you won't get it right the

00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:56,720
first time

00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:58,640
absolutely know that and parenthetically

00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:00,480
write in your first bit of governance

00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,599
the model to change the governance and

00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,560
update it because otherwise

00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,359
bad things happen and then collaborate

00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,800
empathize

00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:08,800
and iterate on your governance

00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,599
inside the project or inside

00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,000
a company that's participating in a

00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,400
project you can create a ton of mistrust

00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,520
just by being misaligned because you

00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,680
don't have

00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,800
you don't have a consistent picture that

00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,560
you're presenting

00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,800
you've got some people who think things

00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:32,079
are going swell and some things

00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:36,240
that aren't and you need to be able to

00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:39,760
notice that work with it understand it

00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:42,480
project cadence is a contract so as you

00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,760
are getting ready for your releases

00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:49,119
do your best to stay with your

00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:52,320
time schedules because

00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:55,920
anything that is downstream from you

00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,960
that is say a corporate sponsor's next

00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:02,160
update

00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,160
is also dependent on your release

00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:09,359
never forget to take the opportunity

00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,400
to do a retrospective to look back on

00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:14,640
that release

00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:16,560
to find out if in fact your

00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,800
processes were followed if they were

00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:21,440
onerous to make sure that there

00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,880
is an update and if for some chance you

00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,000
missed a date and there were

00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,560
downstream uh impacts for a company

00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,880
how was that handled by the uh by the

00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:34,079
project by the companies etc

00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,560
all of this is part of the contract

00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:37,520
you have in a community trying to

00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,800
provide

00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:43,599
a project and

00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,480
in the case of kubernetes it grew beyond

00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,520
anything

00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,040
we imagined and when i talk about

00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,000
downstream contracts

00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,280
there are 70 some distributions of

00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,760
kubernetes

00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,440
and those are all all contracts we slip

00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,119
a release date by a week

00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,960
and a whole lot of companies have some

00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,640
challenges

00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:07,520
so to just child to just go

00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,000
out and say straight back to the old

00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,920
school

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:15,040
open source ethos we reject kings

00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:18,720
presidents and voting we believe in

00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:21,920
rough consensus and running code

00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:24,960
so i challenge you all

00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:28,240
to go out into your communities

00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:31,040
make sure that the culture that you have

00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:33,280
is the culture you want if it's not work

00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:36,480
to change it

00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,599
and take as many of these possible

00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,880
learnings

00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,720
because they are possible they may not

00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,240
fit in every community take as many of

00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:45,920
these learnings as is useful

00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:48,240
to you and expand upon them learn more

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,839
come back and tell me i was wrong come

00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,040
back and tell me i should add three more

00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:53,839
points

00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:55,920
write the following talk all of those

00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:59,200
would be great options

00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,079
so let's go back to the whole how did we

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,520
get here

00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,200
talk through some of the things that

00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,800
have led to our projects

00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,880
looking the way they do the shapes that

00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:10,640
they do where are we going

00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:14,720
i didn't really touch on that yet right

00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:16,079
so i'm leaving that as an exercise to

00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,160
the reader

00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,000
where are we going where do you want

00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,599
your project communities to go

00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,040
how do you want them to engage with

00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,800
their ecosystem

00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,800
how do you want them to engage with

00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:29,440
corporate sponsors

00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,640
what is the best of the open source

00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:33,680
project

00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:36,480
what is the purpose that a company

00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:38,400
had in open sourcing a project think

00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,800
about all of these things

00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,200
and then let me know how i can help you

00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,839
get where you want to go

00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,839
thank you

00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:55,040
uh thanks sarah

00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:57,440
very good interesting talk um

00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,800
there are a couple of questions

00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,560
fantastic

00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:06,000
um maybe there will be more um

00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:08,640
but the first one is um and actually

00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,319
there are some emoji reactions coming up

00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:14,319
on the screen um uh

00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:16,480
yeah the first question is from your

00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:19,440
experience what's the best way to

00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:21,760
make and keep a community open uh make

00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,079
it easy for new people to become part of

00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,839
it

00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:26,160
i guess a often asked question yeah

00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:29,680
what's

00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:33,040
important what's my input on

00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:34,240
um basically building it keeping it

00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:36,720
together and

00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:37,839
uh and then also making space for people

00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:41,040
to grow

00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:42,880
so that is that is for me one of the

00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,240
pieces of this that is most important

00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,839
is that we need to make sure that

00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,800
there's space in a community for people

00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:50,319
to grow

00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,920
because people don't want to show up in

00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:53,680
open source especially if they're not

00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,160
being paid to contribute as their day

00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,760
job

00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,440
they don't necessarily want to show up

00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,760
in open source and do their day job

00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:03,319
again so they may want to be learning

00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:05,760
and engaging on a new topic or

00:44:03,319 --> 00:44:07,760
participating in some special interest

00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,200
group so they can learn about it while

00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:12,400
leading another

00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,040
um so in terms of bringing together a

00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,160
community

00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:19,520
i'm always out looking for

00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:21,760
the people who are um

00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,200
who are raising their hands to do things

00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:26,319
or

00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,359
and the people who are complaining so in

00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:29,040
a community

00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:30,720
you can find the people who are like oh

00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:32,480
i'll do that but you don't want to rely

00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,760
on them too much because you will burn

00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,359
them out really fast because they're

00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,200
they're the people who jump up and say

00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:39,119
i'll do that you also want to

00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:39,839
acknowledge them and then you also want

00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,720
to

00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:43,760
um draw in the people say who are very

00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,359
um

00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,520
grumpy about something great let's

00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:50,240
empower you to fix it

00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,480
and so if you keep this actual

00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:55,680
management going on

00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,440
learning what your contributors want for

00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,880
their career goals learning what your

00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,640
contributors want to be

00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:03,119
learning from the project as well as

00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:07,119
what they're contributing to the project

00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:10,880
offering them ways to get something back

00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:12,640
that is a benefit to them as well as all

00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,680
the work that they offer to the project

00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:18,640
that to me makes for

00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,319
a stickier community because there's a

00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,560
second order effect of that so if you're

00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:24,720
working to try to do all of that

00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:27,760
with your community the second order

00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:32,720
effect is you're making friends

00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:36,480
and that keeps the community together

00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:40,000
um yeah sure that that's the case

00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:42,240
um second question is um

00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:43,760
you talked about defining values for

00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,319
your community

00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,599
um when's the right time to agree on

00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:50,400
those because

00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:52,319
when you start a new project there isn't

00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,119
the culture that then creates the value

00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:58,640
so what comes first what comes second

00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:00,480
i think early on it is i think you won't

00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,000
be documenting your values

00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,000
from like day one we're starting a new

00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,119
project how about that

00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:09,040
um you won't start from there

00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:11,599
you will be having a lot of

00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:13,680
conversations as you're setting up

00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:14,720
this project with you know the peer

00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,560
group that you have

00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,079
the collaborators and contributors that

00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,040
you're trying to do this it might be

00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:21,280
four or five people

00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:22,960
it might be two companies it might be

00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,040
you know whatever it is

00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,480
and as you are starting to make those

00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:28,400
early decisions

00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,240
you can actually look at how you're

00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,280
making decisions there

00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:36,720
and bring up these questions

00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,440
you know the um for example the

00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,560
community

00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:43,119
versus community is better than company

00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:44,800
or community comes before company in um

00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:47,119
kubernetes values

00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,480
that came because we had you know all

00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:50,640
these different pull requests

00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,400
that we were looking at and we're like

00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,720
how do we make decisions on these you

00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,280
know

00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:57,520
is so red hat's a big contributor maybe

00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:59,440
it means that red hat gets priority

00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,839
well maybe not that doesn't seem right

00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,599
either you know so as we were discussing

00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:05,520
these things as leaders of the project

00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:06,480
about how to make these decisions early

00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:10,240
on

00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:13,599
that led to those sort of nascent values

00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:16,480
so we started talking through

00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:16,800
what how we were making the decisions

00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,800
and

00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,240
that that was the first step toward

00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,640
governance as well for us

00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,680
was just like okay so we've made these

00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,240
decisions we've been running this

00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:26,079
project

00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:27,520
like two and at the time we started

00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,599
having these discussions the project had

00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:32,960
been running like two years

00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:35,280
and it was this sort of hazy um

00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,200
you know which googler do you ask to get

00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:40,640
permission to do this thing

00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:43,839
and what if one of them disagrees but

00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:47,040
one of them agrees what happens then

00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:48,079
so we ended up having to um very slowly

00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:50,240
tease out

00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:52,880
how decisions were being made by looking

00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:55,760
at what was happening organically

00:47:52,880 --> 00:48:07,839
and then try to develop it as something

00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:07,839
that we could write down

00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,480
