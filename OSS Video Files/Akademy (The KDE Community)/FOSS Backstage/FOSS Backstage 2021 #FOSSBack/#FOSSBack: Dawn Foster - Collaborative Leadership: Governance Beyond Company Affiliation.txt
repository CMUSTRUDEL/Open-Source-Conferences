Title: #FOSSBack: Dawn Foster - Collaborative Leadership: Governance Beyond Company Affiliation
Publication date: 2021-02-25
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Open source projects that are controlled by a single company are at a greater risk of changes that are not aligned with community interests, whereas projects that are under neutral foundations have a lower risk both for end users and software vendors. With advantages that include community building, innovation, and wider adoption, we should consider contributing more of our open source projects to neutral foundations.

This talk will cover:

    Challenges of giving up control and why it might be worth it.
    Selecting a foundation and how to determine neutrality.
    Creating a fair and neutral governance structure and processes for your project.
    Tips for contributing and maintaining your project.

The audience will get practical advice about whether they should contribute their projects to neutral foundations along with how and when to do it.

so

00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,639
welcome to my talk my

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,200
slides are already uploaded on the

00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:14,639
speaking tab of

00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,120
fastwonderblog.com if you want to follow

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,359
along

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,880
or grab the links that are sprinkled

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,880
throughout the presentation

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,000
and we should have almost 10 minutes at

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,000
the end for questions

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,439
so drop your questions into the

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,080
questions tab

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,760
and i'll answer a few live before we

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,760
move into the breakout room

00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,600
today i'm going to talk about a few

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,160
topics related to governance

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,680
starting with a look at the differences

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,719
between projects that are under

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,800
foundations

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,480
compared to projects that are run out of

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,160
individual companies

00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,640
after that i'll talk about how

00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,680
governance is mostly about the roles and

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,760
processes

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,960
that guide how people collaborate and

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,239
make decisions

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,079
including some thoughts on how to

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,800
document all of this in ways that set

00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,920
your project

00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,600
up project up for success then i'll wrap

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,680
it up with a few final thoughts

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,320
and links to hopefully some useful

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,320
resources

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,840
first i'll tell you a bit about me i've

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,040
been in the technology industry for over

00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,680
20 years working mostly on open source

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,240
projects

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,920
from within companies like puppet and

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,479
intel where interestingly enough i

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,600
worked with

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,280
denise our last presenter at pivotal i

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,200
was responsible for driving our

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,040
kubernetes contribution strategy

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,040
so that's kind of how i got involved in

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,119
the kubernetes contributor experience

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,119
special interest group now that i'm

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,600
working in vmware's open source program

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,840
office

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,360
and i'm responsible for our open source

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,920
community strategy

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,360
lately i've been more active in the cncf

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,759
contributor strategy

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,640
sig in particular the governance working

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,560
group

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,399
i'm also on the steering committee for

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,720
the linux foundation's to-do group

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,560
where companies collaborate on ways to

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,000
run successful open source program

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,240
offices

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,159
i'm also a board member of open uk which

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,799
is focused on developing and sustaining

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,759
leadership

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,439
in open technology within the uk and i'm

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,520
a governing board member and maintainer

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,440
for the linux foundation's chaos project

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,560
which is focused on using metrics to

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,200
evaluate the health

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,360
of open source projects i also have a

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,640
phd from the university of greenwich

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,319
here in london

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,080
where i was researching how people

00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,080
working at many different companies

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,000
collaborate together within the linux

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,560
kernel

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,120
now i wanted to start by talking about

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,000
why

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,879
it's so important to think about who

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,519
owns

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,680
or controls an open source project

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,440
because it's something that many of us

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,720
don't spend as much time thinking about

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,319
as we should

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,040
projects that are controlled by

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,519
foundations and ones that are owned by

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,519
an individual company can have very

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,440
different dynamics and risks

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,840
associated with participating in those

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,840
projects

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,519
it is not always clear whether a

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,640
foundation is neutral

00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,200
or not i generally start by looking at

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,519
the

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,560
leadership for the foundation if the

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,640
board of directors

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,400
or other leadership bodies are made up

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,200
of people who work at a wide range of

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,959
companies

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,120
especially if they're competing

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,879
companies that's a good indication that

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,599
it's a neutral foundation with a good

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,159
balance of people to represent various

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,760
aspects within the industry

00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,599
if the board members on the other hand

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,720
are primarily made up of people from a

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,640
single company

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,720
or maybe just a couple of companies that

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,440
have very close ties together

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,120
it's also not likely to be a neutral

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,440
foundation

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,120
trademarks are another thing to look at

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,799
in a neutral foundation

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,640
the foundation should own the trademarks

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,840
associated with for example the name of

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,720
the foundation

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,640
and probably most of the projects if the

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,640
trademarks are owned by a company

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,560
especially a single company across the

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,920
whole foundation that's a red flag that

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,319
the foundation is probably

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,280
not neutral it can also help to look at

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,120
the projects

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,959
under that foundation were they

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,879
originated at a single company

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,159
or did they come from a wide variety of

00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,319
different companies

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,920
do those projects have leaders from a

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,680
variety of companies

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,280
do they have contributor license

00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,400
agreements from one company

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,480
or is the cla from the foundation

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,000
the more you see references to a single

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,639
company across the

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,079
projects the less likely it is to be

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,519
neutral

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,880
and these are just a few of the many

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,639
things that you can look at when you're

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,639
trying to decide if a foundation is

00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,600
neutral

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:30,000
the apache software foundation the cloud

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,720
native computing foundation cncf

00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,720
eclipse and the linux foundation those

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,520
are all neutral foundations

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,240
on the flip side the open usage commons

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,080
foundation

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,000
is not one that i would classify as a

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,080
neutral foundation

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,560
the success of kubernetes can be

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,800
attributed in part to being contributed

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,560
to the cloud native computing foundation

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,880
putting kubernetes into a neutral

00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,720
foundation with representation from a

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,040
bunch of different companies

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,759
provided a level playing field where

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,240
each of us

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,680
could collaborate and innovate as equals

00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,600
to create something that benefits the

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,080
whole ecosystem

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,840
with neutral foundations our end users

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,160
get access to more innovation

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,240
from a diverse group of contributors

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,320
while also reducing vendor lock-in

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,400
for example users of kubernetes can

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,400
consume enterprise versions

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,000
from a wide variety of vendors that can

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,880
run on any of the leading cloud

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,320
providers

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,320
or they can roll their own solution

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,759
using open source kubernetes

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,479
and as software vendors we can

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:31,039
contribute to foundation-driven projects

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,120
with the confidence that no one company

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,039
is in control of the project

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,039
and that we can contribute as equals

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,840
within the community regardless of who

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,840
we work for

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,280
open source projects that are controlled

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,000
by a single company

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,080
are higher risk because they operate at

00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,320
the whims of that company

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,320
whereas projects that are under neutral

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,960
foundations have a lower risk

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,280
both for end users and software vendors

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,759
when a project is owned by a company

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,919
there's little recourse for outside

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,919
contributors when that company decides

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,840
to go in a direction that doesn't align

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,240
with the needs or expectations of the

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,919
other participants within the community

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,560
when a project is owned or controlled by

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,960
a company consider the reputation

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,800
of that company as a steward of open

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,360
source projects

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,880
but always keep in mind that they can

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,600
change their strategy

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,560
at some later date we've seen some of

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,039
this with google

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,400
around the istio and k native projects

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,319
and i'm not saying that we shouldn't

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,639
participate in projects

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,440
that are owned by other companies but we

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,319
should

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,360
think about the risks that we're taking

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,759
in some cases

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,639
it makes a lot of sense to accept this

00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,240
higher risk

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,479
but we should at least try to make sure

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,880
that we understand the risks that we're

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,880
taking

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,360
at vmware for example we believe that

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,599
contributing open source projects to

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,360
neutral foundations is important

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,039
and it's something that we do regularly

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,560
for projects that we've started once

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,720
they start to gain a bit of traction

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,360
with people outside of the company

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,360
for example we've contributed harbor and

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,280
contour to the cncf

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,759
we contributed turn to the linux

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,280
foundation's automated compliance

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,199
tooling project

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,720
we've also contributed projects to the

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,840
apache software foundation

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,680
and other foundations the challenge with

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,840
contributing open source projects to

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,400
foundations is that you also give up

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,039
some of your control to the foundation

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,880
typically

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,080
assets like the project's trademark

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,960
repositories

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,280
websites and other things would be

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:35,039
transferred to the foundation

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,560
existing maintainers and leaders will

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,560
usually keep their positions

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,680
however neutral foundations usually make

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,520
sure that governance

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,960
is set up in a way that makes it easy

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,080
for people from other companies to

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,680
participate

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,000
and eventually move into leadership

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,599
positions so as the contributing company

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,520
you should expect more leadership

00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,160
transitions over the longer term which

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,720
is

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,319
perfectly healthy and while this does

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,879
mean giving up some control over the

00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,680
project

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,759
there are a lot of benefits with

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,400
advantages around community building

00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,680
innovation and wider adoption it's

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,720
something that we should at least

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,120
consider for our open source projects

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,960
it's also important to think about when

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,520
your project might be ready

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,280
to contribute to a neutral foundation if

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,080
your project is very immature and just

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,720
getting started

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,360
foundations are less likely to be

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,680
interested

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,280
in your project whereas a project with a

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,960
bunch of users that's starting to get

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,400
really good traction within the industry

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,840
that just maybe needs some help moving

00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,680
up to the next level

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,240
is going to be a lot more likely to be

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,560
accepted by a foundation

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,360
and however however companies should

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,959
understand

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,599
that contributing a project to a

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,399
foundation is an ongoing commitment

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,839
it is not an exit strategy and you need

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,760
to be prepared to provide

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,519
staff and other support over the long

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,720
term and the short term

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,640
just like you would if you weren't

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:56,399
contributing it to a foundation

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,880
we've been doing quite a bit of work

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,640
within the cncf contributor strategy

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,480
sig in the governance working group to

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,600
help document some governance best

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,440
practices

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,440
and this section contains ideas

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,000
inspiration and materials that i've been

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,000
working on

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,519
along with other people like josh burkus

00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,519
for example within the working group

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,399
so a lot of people really like to hate

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,519
on governance

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,000
it's just extra paperwork it's busy work

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,240
it's

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,360
politics that get in the way of doing

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,240
the real

00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,959
work on the project the reality is

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,440
governance

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,320
can be found in all open source projects

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,040
in one form

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,440
or another to specify the processes for

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,320
how

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,120
people work together within the project

00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,360
ideally

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,480
it will be clearly documented but for

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,000
some projects

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,600
especially smaller ones it might be a

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,480
bit more ad hoc

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,240
and informal governance helps outline

00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,959
the expectations

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,200
around roles and responsibilities along

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,279
with the decision-making processes

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,040
so it's important to have at least the

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,640
basics in place early

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,320
since it's one of those things you may

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,279
think you don't need

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,839
until you realize you do it's usually

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,720
easier

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,000
to set clear expectations up front

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,320
rather than realizing

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,839
later that various people have very

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,760
different expectations

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,000
which can take a lot more time to sort

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,000
out this doesn't mean that you need to

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,279
specify everything up front

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,120
and i would discourage you from over

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,720
engineering your governance processes

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,720
before you need them

00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,880
a project with only a few people will

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,200
not need elaborate elections to select

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,000
leaders but you should probably define

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,760
a few basic roles like maintainer to

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,880
find the process for contributing to

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,720
your project

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,880
and talk about how decisions about those

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,040
contributions are made

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,160
if the process for collaboration and

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,079
decision making are

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,600
not clearly documented as part of the

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,880
project governance

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,440
this can increase the risk of

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,800
participating in or using the project

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,560
because it introduces a lot of

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,120
uncertainty into the mix

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,880
knowing how collaboration occurs and how

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,880
decisions are made

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,800
is vital to being able to make

00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,279
contributions that are more likely to be

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,279
accepted

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,040
there are a few documents that every

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,120
project even the small ones should have

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,480
it should go without saying but open

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,279
source projects need

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,600
the appropriate licensing documentation

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,519
i

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,040
occasionally find repos with missing

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,040
license files

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,480
but more often i see licenses not

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:28,880
applied correctly

00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,560
within projects so in addition to just

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,000
checking the box to put a license file

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,399
in your repository

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,120
some licenses do actually require other

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,320
things

00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,120
like a notices file or license headers

00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,160
within each source file you should also

00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,640
have a code of conduct

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,519
that people can easily find with details

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,160
about how to report

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,320
incidents along with the consequences of

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,320
violating the code of conduct

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,920
now sometimes people who are new to

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,800
implementing code of conduct

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,079
codes of conduct find it intimidating

00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,680
because i think it's something they need

00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,440
to write from scratch

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,600
so don't do that i would encourage you

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,440
to use something like the contributor

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,760
covenant which is pretty much the gold

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,440
standard for codes of conduct right now

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,040
and it can be simply copied and added to

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,519
your repository

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,560
now the bit that you do need to spend

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,399
some time on

00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,560
is making sure that you have a plan for

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,440
enforcing it you'll need to nominate a

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,959
couple of people

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,639
who will be responsible for taking

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,880
reports of violations

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,639
and handling them responsibly the

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,000
contributor covenant page has more

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,760
details and links

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,200
to resources for learning about

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,279
implementing and enforcing a code of

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,120
conduct

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,959
your contribution documents should

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,800
provide enough details about the

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,880
contribution process so that someone

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,399
new to the project can make their very

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,160
first contribution

00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,079
this includes details about how to sign

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,600
your contributor license agreement if

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,000
you have one or how to use the

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,040
developer certificate of origin or dco

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,880
process

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,680
if you have strong preferences about

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,040
coding style testing documentation or

00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,040
other requirements

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,680
this is a good opportunity to make sure

00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,600
that new contributors know these upfront

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,720
which helps reduce the burden of trying

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,040
to educate each

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,160
individual contributor separately about

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,760
your requirements

00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,680
while you're also trying to review their

00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,959
contributions

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,200
and you'll want to make sure that your

00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,880
contributors know what to expect

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,200
and how to navigate the project when

00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,279
making contributions

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,399
the communication process should be

00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,200
clearly defined

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,200
so that people know where and how to

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,560
communicate within the project

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,240
maybe you prefer mailing list

00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,200
discussions or

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,160
slack messages or issues or feature

00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,360
requests

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,120
and maybe you have separate

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,040
communication channels for users and

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,639
another one for developers

00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,320
make sure everyone understands how

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,959
people within the project communicate

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,360
with each other

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:47,120
to avoid a frustrating experience not

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,839
just for new contributors but also for

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,839
your existing ones

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,320
projects should also document the

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,720
processes for reporting

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,639
and responding to security issues

00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,199
projects that take a really proactive

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,040
approach

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,320
to addressing security issues and

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,120
releasing fixes

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,959
are much more likely to be secure you

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,000
could also be using some automated tools

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,240
like dependabot

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,839
just for example to help identify when

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,320
new versions of dependencies

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,639
are available which also helps keep on

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,320
top of potential security issues

00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,560
and while there are no guarantees and

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,760
critical security issues can sort of

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:25,600
pop up at any time taking a proactive

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,680
approach to security reduces the

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,320
likelihood of having security issues

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,600
that will be

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:34,079
exploited later the project should have

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,399
a security.md file or another document

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,720
with

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,360
details about the process for reporting

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,000
and responding to security concerns

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,000
at a minimum you want to have a way for

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
people to privately report security

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,320
issues and have a few people who are

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,480
designated to handle those issues

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,399
large projects that are used by vendors

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,000
within their commercial products

00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,399
should also have things like embargo

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,120
lists where you can provide them with

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,720
private information to those vendors and

00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,279
give them some time to prepare

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,880
their security fixes for their products

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,480
in advance of the security issue

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,480
becoming public to help them

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,680
avoid being exploited using your open

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,279
source project

00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,760
when the issue does eventually become

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,959
public

00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,199
you should have some kind of

00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:19,199
documentation about your leadership

00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:21,920
for small projects you might just need a

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:24,079
list of maintainers in your readme file

00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,959
or maybe owners or maintainers files

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,800
that indicate

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,279
which people are responsible for the

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,360
various areas within your project

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,880
defining the roles and responsibilities

00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,279
for contributors

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,720
reviewers and maintainers is probably

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,480
enough as a first step

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,360
which can then help you with recruiting

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,199
new people into these roles

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,480
for bigger projects you'll want to have

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,399
more details

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,160
about the specific roles and

00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,519
responsibilities for the different

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,759
leadership roles

00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,600
along with how others can then move into

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,320
those leadership positions

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,839
you might have committees working groups

00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,519
special interest groups

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,839
or other groups that will eventually

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,600
need leaders and again having all this

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,759
documented helps you recruit

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,519
new leaders as you try to grow the

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,279
project and need more people to share in

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,959
the workload

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,720
there are quite a few different options

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,040
for selecting leaders

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,959
as part of defining your governance and

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,000
the ideal is to have a process that

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,120
provides a fair

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,160
and level playing field that defines how

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,480
contributors

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,279
can become leaders this should be

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,199
documented

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,440
so that all participants can clearly

00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,160
understand the criteria and process for

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,320
moving both

00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,680
into and then out of leadership

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,040
positions

00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:38,480
most of the bigger projects like

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,680
kubernetes have an election process

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,480
at least for the top levels of

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,240
leadership like a steering committee

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,920
and at lower levels of leadership many

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,880
projects have a process where

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,120
existing leaders then select new leaders

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,519
for example new maintainers are often

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,480
nominated by existing maintainers and

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,199
approved after

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,880
a certain number of maintainers agree or

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,320
sometimes it requires a vote

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,320
by other maintainers or committee

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,240
members and there are a bunch of

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,000
different options for selecting leaders

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,839
so i won't try to cover them all here

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,520
but there is an entire

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,280
document devoted to these options

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,640
available at the link on the bottom of

00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,640
the slide for more details

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,959
your project governance should be

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,160
designed

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:25,439
to keep diversity equity and inclusion

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,280
top of mind building a diverse community

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,720
where all people feel welcome and

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,320
included does

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:34,640
not just happen it requires putting work

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,400
and thought into it and when you're

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,320
starting a project and thinking about

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,200
governance this is a good time to do

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,200
this

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,039
i talked about codes of conduct earlier

00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,480
and having a code of conduct that you

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,799
actively enforce

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,760
helps make sure that everyone feels safe

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,919
and welcome

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,360
within your community providing an

00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,200
environment where everyone

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,480
including people from marginalized

00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,039
populations feel

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,440
safe is the first step toward building a

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,520
diverse community around your project

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,200
you should also look at whether you have

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,000
a diverse set of people

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,880
at every level within the project but

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,440
especially at leadership positions

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:14,160
and if not come up with programs that

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,799
help underrepresented folks get involved

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,799
and then move up within your project

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,360
ideally having programs that provide

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:23,520
people opportunities for shadowing

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,039
mentoring and sponsoring new potential

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,760
leaders can help you grow

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,280
a diverse set of people into new leaders

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,760
for your project

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,840
the kubernetes contributor experience

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,840
sig is a great place to see an example

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,840
of how to implement programs for things

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,679
like shadowing and mentoring

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,520
projects that make a concerted effort to

00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,160
bring in new people from a variety of

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,320
backgrounds

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,320
and have programs in place that help

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,080
them grow into leadership positions

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,760
are more likely to benefit from

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,919
increased innovation and have a

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,360
healthier community

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,520
diversity inclusion can also be

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,160
difficult to measure

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,960
and it often involves mostly a manual

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,880
assessment

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,080
but we've defined some metrics within

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,240
the chaos projects

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,840
diversity equity and inclusion working

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,600
group that you should have a look at

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,840
for ideas about measuring various

00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,480
aspects so that you can improve your

00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,320
projects

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,320
diversity equity and inclusion

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,240
governance is one of those things that

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,120
is never really

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,760
finished we work in a space with

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,799
constant

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:27,919
change the technologies change

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:30,320
our strategies change the way we work

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,200
in a pandemic for example can completely

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,480
change

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,880
everything changes and our governance

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,320
needs to evolve right along with these

00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,720
changes

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,320
in particular as open source projects

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,960
become more mature

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,600
and grow what they need from governance

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,400
will change

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,080
dramatically the governance processes

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,600
that you need as a small

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,400
project when you only have a couple of

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:56,559
maintainers is likely to be insufficient

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,880
if the project grows dramatically

00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,679
so as your projects evolve your

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,280
governance

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:05,360
should evolve right along with them

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,039
now before i wrap up the talk let me

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,600
leave you with a few resources that you

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,480
might find

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,280
useful the to do group has a bunch of

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,280
guides that have

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,200
great information about creating and

00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,960
managing healthy projects

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,280
and many of them talk about various

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,919
aspects of governance

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,120
the cncf contributor strategy sig has a

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,559
governance working group

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,080
with more details about what you need

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,000
for governance and some options for

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,240
leadership selection

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,559
the open source way guidebook is a

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,720
fantastic resource it has an entire

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,760
chapter on governance with loads of

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,440
details

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,760
and these are all really great starting

00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,799
places for understanding how to govern

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,799
your open source project

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,240
there are so many aspects of good

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,720
governance

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,400
for open source projects and i only had

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,440
time to talk in detail about a few of

00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,600
the ones that i

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,480
think are the most important but taking

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,559
a step back

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,000
and you know looking at the big picture

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,039
what i have on the slide

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,360
is the common theme that drives why i

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,880
think

00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,120
governance as a whole is so important

00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,640
governance provides a framework for

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,000
setting expectations for roles

00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,840
responsibilities how people within your

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,280
project should behave

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,400
but clearly documenting these

00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:20,559
expectations you can reduce uncertainty

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,559
and make it easier for people to

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:25,200
participate in your project

00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:27,200
the more you can do to help everyone

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,440
participate in meaningful ways

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,480
the more welcome they'll feel within

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,000
your open source

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:36,240
community with that i will say

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,799
thank you for coming to my talk and i

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:42,640
think we have a little time for

00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:43,520
questions um yes thank you for that uh

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,880
wonderful talk

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:50,080
um i have a question because

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:53,520
um here at frostbackstage we

00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:56,240
like to think of ourselves as a non-code

00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:58,320
contributors to open source projects um

00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,880
by doing what we do and we've

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,039
been trying to make uh improvements to

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,200
our diversity and inclusivity

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,320
and um i've been working on that and one

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,440
of the problems that i

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:12,640
i struggled with is the metrics is

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:16,240
is finding ways to to to measure that

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,640
and to know um the right ways to do it

00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,039
and

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,000
um what to be looking for and things

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,200
like that i wonder if

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,039
you have any uh thoughts or tips or

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,200
advice for stuff like that

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,640
yeah absolutely i think the so the

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,799
non-code contributions

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,799
are an incredibly important part of any

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,000
open source project right so it's not

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,440
just about writing the code there's all

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:39,280
this other stuff that has to happen

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,600
along with it just like you know any

00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:44,000
other project at any company

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,159
and it is it is harder to measure um

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,640
primarily because a lot of that work

00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,280
actually happens outside of github which

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,039
tends to be

00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,720
or outside of your code repository or

00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,400
your issues whatever whatever you happen

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,120
to use

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,960
which makes it a lot harder to track now

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,760
one of the ways that the kubernetes

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,880
project addressed this is they really

00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,480
try to do

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:09,360
most of the work through through github

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:11,760
and using github issues so i was uh one

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,760
of the organizers for the contributor

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,880
um the contributor summit kubernetes

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,320
contributor summit

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,320
and one of the things that we did is we

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,960
had we had github project boards we had

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,000
issues for each of the individual you

00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,000
know elements

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,440
and you know we would comment on them we

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,600
would keep those issues updated

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,360
and we also had you know markdown files

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,080
in the github repository that had

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,919
details

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,200
about what we were doing to organize the

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,360
contributor summit

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,960
so that gave us you know legitimate ways

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,320
to kind of measure that

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,600
and then you know the other i think

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,880
maybe part of the other half of your

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,760
question was how do you how do you get

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,720
more people

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,400
um involved and one of the things that

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,520
also within the kubernetes community

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,440
that they do

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,960
is they have really good shadowing

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,000
programs

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,679
what that means is that when i you know

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,400
when i'm working in the contributor

00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,840
uh for the contributor summit it's if

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,679
i'm leading a section of it

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,200
i usually have a shadow who then helps

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,559
me do some of the work

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,960
under under my leadership with the idea

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,840
that then that shadow if they enjoyed

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,200
that experience

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,880
and it was a positive one and things

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,880
worked really well that they're

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,640
likely to actually lead that component

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,760
in the next round

00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,919
so um so that actually works

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,600
uh works quite well the kubernetes

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,440
community does that around a few issues

00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,159
they do it for the release team as well

00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,440
so that you know not the it's not the

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,960
same set of people who are always

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,600
involved in the release which is kind of

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,279
a

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,120
it's a daunting task and it's a lot of

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,799
work and it's you know to do that

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:38,480
every single every single release is

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,240
really hard and so they have the

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,400
really robust shadowing program where

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,600
they have multiple shadows for every

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,679
single role

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,360
and it's a really good way to mentor

00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,760
people into the community because they

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,520
can

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,120
they can help out they can see what it's

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,400
like and

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,240
you know then hopefully move into a

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,320
leadership position later

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,120
great that sounds really interesting um

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:02,000
i have a question for you from the chat

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,799
it says um how can we best document ways

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,200
to improve

00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,400
governance processes so that newcomers

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,799
can truly understand

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,600
the best ways to improve governance and

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:13,279
processes

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:15,039
too yeah that's a really good question i

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:17,760
think i think that depends a lot

00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:19,279
on the size of the project i think um

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,640
you know if you're kind of a smaller

00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,320
project and you don't have a lot of

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,159
governance documentation

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,840
i think the first step is to actually

00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:29,360
beef up the governance documentation

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:30,400
um you know the other the other thing

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,240
that you can do

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,679
is you can you can have a group that's

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,919
actually responsible for that

00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,559
so i mean obviously the cnc app is a you

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:41,039
know very large organization with no

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:43,279
projects and so the you know we have

00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,000
this contributor strategy sig within the

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,840
cncf

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,840
and there's a governance working group

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,360
and so we help the cncf

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,679
come up with best practices

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,960
documentation things like that so you

00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:54,320
can do something similar for your

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,159
project where you have a couple of

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,559
people who are responsible for kind of

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,720
maintaining the governance of the

00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,320
the project you know a lot of a lot of

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,440
projects it's usually some like a

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,600
steering committee

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,600
or or something like that that maintains

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,279
a lot of the governance documentation

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,640
so in those cases it's a little harder

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:13,200
to get new people

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,080
um involved but you know in general like

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,480
having having

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,720
working groups and you know special

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,799
interest groups focused on things like

00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,640
maintaining the governance i think is a

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,279
really good idea for projects i mean

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,640
that's

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,480
one thing i think the kubernetes

00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,320
community has done a really good job of

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,520
is you know they have all of these

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,640
different working groups and special

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:34,000
interest groups that are

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,440
involved in very different things and so

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,039
it's easy coming into the

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,640
the project to you know just find

00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:40,960
something that interests you and start

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,480
start going to their meetings start you

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,159
know watching watching their issues and

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,600
pr's on github and you can really kind

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,840
of kind of see what's going on

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,679
but but i do think the governance piece

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,760
is a little bit harder because there

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,760
are definitely definitely some nuances

00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,840
associated with governance and it's

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,360
um it's not it's not easy to put

00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,000
together governance for a project so it

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,000
does

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
it does take some work usually from you

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,159
know some more experienced people once

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
once the project gets faster

00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,799
but i think you know pull people in and

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,480
and and have them help out maybe

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,159
maybe shadowing somebody would be a good

00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,880
opportunity for that as well if you have

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,039
somebody

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,480
working on overhauling some of the

00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:21,840
governance i think that might be a good

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,840
opportunity to get more people involved

00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,000
