Title: #FOSSBack Keith Bergelt - OS Technical and Patent Collaboration in Parallel & Patent Risk Mitigation
Publication date: 2021-03-01
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Given the nature of collaborative development of Open Source Software (OSS) in projects, projects must ensure that technical development occurs along with legal cooperation between developers and users.  Participation in technology development through OSS requires that we look to community solutions for patent risk mitigation.


Participants will be introduced to the Open Invention Network and develop an understanding of the organization’s mission, free membership, community initiatives, and support of OSS innovation through projects.

	00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,520
the parallelism

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,000
that exists obviously everybody's

00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,599
familiar with the technical side of open

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
source you have

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,280
uh individuals collaborating and the

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,359
modality of

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,480
of that collaboration creating kind of

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,840
new novelty where

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,240
it otherwise couldn't exist uh is

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,439
uh is a critical uh kind of

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,480
transformational

00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:33,200
uh movement in terms of uh

00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:36,719
of crossing geographic lines crossing uh

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,680
lines uh uh between uh countries and

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,399
individuals

00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,760
uh that uh maybe don't get along so well

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,719
there's a meeting in the middle that

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,440
happens around

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,480
uh around the technical collaboration of

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,680
open source

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,239
it's a very special experience uh it's

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,039
actually

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,680
uh something that i think a lot of

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,079
people

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:58,719
in government and even leadership and

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,719
organizations don't fully understand

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,920
how powerful this movement is it's a

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,040
social movement

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,080
that uh that creates new novelty through

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,920
the idea that that anyone can come

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,600
together and build on each other's ideas

00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,720
it kind of stems from the

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,920
the basic uh and most uh

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,400
uh most uh fundamental uh

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,680
kind of desire to be able to distill the

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,240
collective intelligence

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,000
of a of an organization of a community

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,479
of multiple organizations

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,840
and individuals to be able to create

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,759
something that couldn't otherwise be

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,880
created and i think it's a

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,960
it in and of itself is uh is uh

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,560
of monumental significance in terms of

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,840
how societies

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,759
uh are working to be able to create uh

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,759
ideas i think if we look i just had a

00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,720
call two days ago

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,399
with uh people working uh in the u.s

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,600
government on uh

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:57,360
a task force uh focused on

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,200
on sharing uh knowledge information

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,479
uh related to the development of

00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,040
vaccines

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:09,039
um and so i think this is uh uh

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:12,959
particularly uh important area

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:15,599
uh for people to focus on um

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,239
so essentially you know we're we all

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,080
have

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,440
an understanding of how this process

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,000
works but

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,800
what sometimes is lost is how i mean

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,040
that you know

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,560
clearly just kind of reinforcing a point

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,760
or two that i made is that

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,000
the the spread the scope the diffusion

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,640
of open source technology is so

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,200
uh significant that every electronic

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,720
touch we have is enabled by open source

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,000
and i think a lot of people

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,000
because of branding and because of the

00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,280
people looking at what chrome is and not

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,640
really understanding

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,160
what what drives chrome uh what the

00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,160
chromium platform is

00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,319
and and then they understand android

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,120
because it's well branded

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,879
uh and all of the other in contact

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,080
points that we have if we do a google

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,120
search

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,360
uh stoplights we cross at uh all the

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,760
platforms that are developed to support

00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,200
uh autonomous driving air traffic

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,360
control systems

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,400
so many environments in which we're in

00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,920
on a daily basis

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,640
we have uh a uh

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,680
an opportunity to uh to enjoy and

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,360
experience the

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,519
the fruits of the collaborative

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,200
development that i talked about earlier

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:29,280
um and i think you know clearly

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,200
i think people on this call people in

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,680
this community understand

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:38,640
that software is rising and the uh

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,799
as we've grown uh open invention network

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,840
has grown and the community's grown

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,000
we've been able to understand the uh and

00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,560
appreciate

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,239
the the fact that more and more

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,560
industries are being affected

00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,799
and you think about the auto industry

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,680
and the auto industry recognized that

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,319
uh as jim zemlin is fond of saying that

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,319
it was

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,799
essentially being disintermediated by a

00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,720
smartphone and a piece of velcro

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,959
and there's been a significant

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,840
transition now that automotive grade

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,959
linux

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,200
uh has emerged as a significant project

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,519
to be able to allow for

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,479
uh vehicles not only the cabin of the

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,840
vehicle but

00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,919
everything all the mission critical uh

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,759
applications within the vehicle are are

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,400
increasingly moving toward

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,000
uh running on the common platform uh the

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,560
agl platform which is

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,440
which is built on top of uh the linux

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,639
kernel

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,960
i think this kind of uh of movement is

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,840
not

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,320
uh not isolated to the to this kind of

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,800
new

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,240
new reality for the auto industry but

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,919
it's for every industry that we

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,639
encounter that has historically been

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,240
hardware

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:51,120
centric is now software centric and so

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,520
uh it's creating a perfect storm if you

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,440
will

00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,880
for more collaboration more

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,160
opportunities for open source to

00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,280
proliferate

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,919
um and that collaboration is creating

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,840
connectivity that again gets to this

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,039
idea of a distilled collective

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,759
intelligence

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,800
uh not only just in a company but across

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,240
a country

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,600
and across uh national lines to include

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,320
the entire world

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,759
of of contributors uh and it drives a

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,800
higher level invented

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,680
of inventiveness and innovation

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,520
uh and so this is just an example of the

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,280
kinds of projects that we support there

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,720
are literally hundreds of projects that

00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,000
we support

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,919
uh and in the parallelism that uh

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,520
that i wanted to talk about is really

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,479
the fact that

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,440
what happens in the technical side this

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,080
kind of

00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,440
uh viral and i hesitate using that term

00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,000
in the current environment but this

00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,199
viral

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,720
uh level of innovation and creativity

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:53,840
uh the organic nature of it uh there's a

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,639
there's a parallel among the uh the

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,479
people who are

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,840
helping on compliance and governance

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,880
inside companies

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,880
uh from the illegal arena

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,880
as well as people who focus on patent

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,919
risk management intellectual property

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:10,960
in general is a major focus of uh

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:14,400
of uh of the

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:16,960
linux foundation uh uh and other uh

00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,080
other organizations that manage projects

00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,720
apache

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,520
uh and others i think there's a there's

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,880
a recognition that

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,360
uh early on probably 15 years ago and

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,120
this is

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,800
obviously it's a movement that's 30 plus

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,840
years old but

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,800
this movement from uh from the

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:40,000
enterprise

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:41,520
out beyond to uh uh to look at uh

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,680
all the applications that are

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,560
represented here and many many more

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,000
in terms of environments and sectors uh

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,759
that movement uh

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,960
is one that created an opportunity um

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,520
for uh for

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,800
adoption of code for many many more

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,160
companies and i think

00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,639
uh 15 years ago uh there was

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,560
a recognition that this was possible but

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,160
i don't think anybody in their wildest

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,800
dreams expected that

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,880
that there'd be such a proliferation and

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,919
so that means that there's so many

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,360
companies

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,960
uh many of them large companies uh that

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,800
have had many issues over their

00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,960
histories with patents

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,319
uh patent litigation being asserted

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,240
against having to pay

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:32,240
uh royalties uh there was a real concern

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:35,199
back 15 16 years ago that

00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,360
uh that the adoption of open source code

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,160
might be slowed or stalled by

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,199
uh individual threats and threateners

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,080
companies uh

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,680
at that time uh because of rhetoric and

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,120
because of actions

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,520
and because of patents in their

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,879
portfolio microsoft was the

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,759
considered the monolithic threat uh and

00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,440
uh and up until just a few years ago

00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,840
when it joined the uh

00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,520
the actually a little over two years ago

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,280
when it joined the uh

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,520
the uh oin community and agreed to make

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,319
its patents subject to cross license

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,879
there was great concern prior to that uh

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,599
about

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,520
what could be done by companies that are

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,000
wedded to proprietary

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,720
and uh highly resistant up until that

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,960
point

00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,800
of utilizing and adopting open source

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,479
code and what that would mean

00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,680
for uh projects like this when core code

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,160
is introduced

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,000
uh the way it should work is that by

00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,839
that that code is picked up

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,399
by individual companies adopted

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,839
incorporated into uh products

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,760
uh and uh there was a fear 15 years ago

00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,880
that that actually wouldn't occur

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,720
um and so um there had to be an

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,519
agreement a compact

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,720
uh between companies around how they

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,440
would manage

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,080
uh their just as as exists on the

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,200
copyright

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,200
side uh there are obligations that go

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,320
along with the opportunity

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:05,440
of open source adoption uh then

00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,440
that are legal and uh and create need

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,240
for governance programs and

00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,920
compliance and and has given rise to

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,680
welcome all matter of tools being

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,839
developed as well as

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,880
uh uh now the uh the quite recent iso

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,160
standard

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:26,080
uh that's been applied to uh

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:29,600
to open chain which is

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,800
all geared toward creating a sustainable

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,839
repeatable

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,880
normalized process for uh

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,760
managing code under the various licenses

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,320
uh that exists and in parallel there's

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,720
there's the the in the legal community

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,320
there's been an and an activity over the

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,360
last 15 years

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,160
it's very specific and and purposeful to

00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,080
ensure that

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,360
that comfort could be had around the

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,399
adoption of code

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,440
and freedom from litigation

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,720
uh and this is an environment that is

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,160
one that

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,959
is very much uh uh

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:08,640
partaking of a certain duality there are

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,720
certain notions that were developed in

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,399
the 90s that came out of game theory

00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,680
around the idea of coopetation we'll

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,959
cooperate

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,880
uh we cooperate and compete uh to

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,480
compete more effectively we cooperate

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,120
with each other and that was really

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,920
around

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,880
almost joint ventures uh maybe

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,519
multi-party

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,360
party activity but nothing that back

00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,240
then that could be conceptualized

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,880
uh as fulsomely as as what open source

00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,320
is

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,480
in terms of this very broad scale uh

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,000
uh hundreds of companies participating

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,600
in individual projects

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,760
uh and developing code that could be

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,760
commonly exploited and used

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:51,120
and so um this world is not one where

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,880
intellectual property goes away people

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,480
if they choose to can still

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,399
differentiate based on

00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:00,160
patenting but there's a notion of where

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,519
that becomes appropriate and where

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,279
that's inappropriate

00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,519
because where we collaborate and build

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:08,320
on each other's ideas in the core

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,320
of open source we need to be able to

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,959
have freedom of action and a

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,079
freedom to know that that adopting that

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,600
code is not going to create

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:20,959
patent issues and create uh unwanted uh

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,640
taxes or tariffs uh in the form of uh of

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,680
licensing fees or

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,959
uh or litigation settlements

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,399
and so it was important at that point 15

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,880
years ago to be able to

00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,880
introduce something that could help uh

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,959
provide that measure of support

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,000
as an increasing number of companies

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,079
from new

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,240
sectors uh that were not terribly

00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,000
familiar with open source and had hadn't

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,959
been as software centric as they've

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,600
become

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,450
over this last 15 years they could have

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,240
that comfort

00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:52,000
[Music]

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,519
and essentially there's this practice

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,320
form of duality

00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,240
that individuals that are responsible

00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,040
for intellectual property strategy in a

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,079
company

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,959
have have needed to to adopt as a result

00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,480
of the uh

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:09,600
the proliferation of open source uh and

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,720
part of that uh that adoption or

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,600
or adjustment is

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,320
to understand uh where it's important

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,360
for

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,320
global collaboration to be able to solve

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,680
problems

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,880
and increasingly you're seeing companies

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,560
participate in this in these kinds of

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,760
activities

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,920
oin is the largest patent non-aggression

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:38,000
community in history

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,760
it was started in o5 the early planning

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,519
work for this was done a couple of years

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,360
prior

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:48,480
and ibm red hat sauce

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,040
nec sony and phillips were the original

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,200
founder

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,079
funding founding members google and

00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,120
toyota came

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:58,880
on a little bit later uh as

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,920
open source uh became uh increasingly

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,040
critical

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,760
for them uh as i said automotive grade

00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,880
linux

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:10,160
was launched uh several years ago

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:12,800
and at that time toyota came in uh

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,399
and and wanted to put a stake in the

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,680
ground to

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,519
evidence its support for patent risk

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,000
mitigation associated with the adoption

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,240
of code

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,839
from that project and from others that

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,040
they they rely on

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,839
and google obviously uh uh as the the

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,440
author

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:34,880
and uh and manager release manager for

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:38,399
uh the most successful uh uh

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:40,480
computing slash uh technology platform

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,440
in the world in the form of android

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,040
uh is deeply committed uh across its

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,240
entire platform of pro

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,199
products and services uh to uh open

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,279
source

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,720
um as i said this is the largest

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,440
community in the

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,320
history of of technology where companies

00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,639
of 3 400 companies and counting

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,519
have come together from startups to the

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:06,240
largest corporations in it in the world

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,040
uh and they have come together to be

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,120
able to

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,320
agree on that basic principle that where

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,639
we collaborate

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,440
where we build on each other's ideas we

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,880
we should

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,959
basically not be suing each other and uh

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,920
it's a it's a pretty simple concept

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,959
there's no fee

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:26,639
associated with this this model uh

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:28,800
it's really just about a behavior uh

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,000
people coming together to recognize that

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,120
their interests are driven

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,120
by collaboration uh and

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,240
and in the increased innovation that

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,199
comes from it

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,760
and the opportunity to be able to work

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,360
together

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:45,680
out into the future uh we own patents

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,040
that we've purchased for the purpose of

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,320
uh

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:53,440
of uh reducing risk

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,079
um we own pat many patents historically

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,480
that

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:59,360
read on threat noise like microsoft that

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,639
we could convey to companies at risk or

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,760
in litigation

00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:06,959
uh as we did uh as one example

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,160
uh a number of years ago when salesforce

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,120
was being sued on

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,240
uh on patents that read on open source

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,399
functionality

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,320
that were owned by microsoft we conveyed

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,440
them patents and allowed them to

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:23,279
properly defend themselves uh and to

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:26,240
uh to uh engage as an equal

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,800
in the uh in the patent litigation uh

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,600
and

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,240
and by virtue of that act to discourage

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,440
further

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,240
uh negative uh uh approaches

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,360
uh by microsoft by other companies again

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,120
committed to

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,639
at that point in their history committed

00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,680
to uh

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:46,720
proprietary platforms and fearful uh

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:49,120
of uh of the effect of of open source on

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,839
the on the proprietary platforms

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,000
so we still own at this point over a

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,399
thousand patents and applications

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,240
that read on uh on critical

00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,040
functionality

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,839
uh and we spent a hundred million

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,800
dollars

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,759
acquiring those patents developing for

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,720
developing

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,279
those patent portfolios expanding them

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,040
uh

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,120
which has been a very important part of

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:15,199
our deterrence particularly during

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,959
this period when operating company risk

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,519
was most acute

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,440
uh and prior to microsoft's becoming a

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,800
participant you know and community

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,279
uh we there are over three million

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,160
patents in the portfolios of the 3 400

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,279
companies

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:35,199
that are exposed to the cross license uh

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:36,000
and uh and we include in order to create

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,880
what the

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,759
the scope of the cross license is we

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,560
have uh

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,199
amassed three thirty three hundred plus

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,320
um

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:49,839
core linux uh associated uh

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,839
open source technology packages that uh

00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,759
their functionality contained in those

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,920
packages create

00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,040
together create the scope of

00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,720
non-aggression

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:03,519
and create the uh the obligation of uh

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,079
of cross-licensing on patents that that

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,039
are

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,839
held in portfolios of the 3 400 plus

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,400
companies

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,919
that uh that cover the functionality

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,559
that's included in this

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:16,160
linux system which is the scope of the

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:19,199
cross license

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:22,400
and so in order to develop uh

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,640
the um that scoping that

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,120
linux system definition uh that i

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,480
described just a minute ago

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:33,520
we work very closely with projects uh

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,880
obviously apache eclipse openstack

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,400
uh linux foundation uh and we'll work

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,080
with new projects as well

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,760
whenever a project management

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,880
organization is launched

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,280
uh and there are interesting uh

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,160
um uh interesting subject matter in

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,720
terms of

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,120
uh what the focuses of projects uh we

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,520
will reach out as we have with open atom

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,480
uh to be able to ensure that we are

00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,160
aware

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,760
of whatever core code they produce

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,679
from the various projects that they

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,720
manage and then we'll look to

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,880
uh to evaluate that code

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,720
we have a internal technical committee

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,720
that's one representative from each of

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,679
our member companies our funding member

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,559
companies

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,799
and then we have a a broader uh

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:22,240
technical advisory council

00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:25,440
which is made up of licensees from

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,760
across the world that have

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,640
have particular knowledge and experience

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,360
in

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,799
in some of the important projects that

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,360
that have been launched

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,960
and we try to bring those companies in

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,840
to be able to work with our technical

00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,760
committee

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,919
to ensure that we're properly

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,919
identifying code that should be included

00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,640
in the linux system definition

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,120
again the scope of the cross license and

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,120
uh

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,880
and that we can properly uh work

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,960
together to be able to vet

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,640
those nominations that have been made to

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,600
ensure that they truly are

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,960
core and uh and that we're not

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,240
artificially

00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:04,400
uh uh covering and uh

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,000
and incorporating into into the cross

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,840
license what would be

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,360
considered appropriately proprietary

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,480
technology uh

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,160
again the world the world is is is

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,120
really about duality

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,840
uh there are that there are innovations

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,880
that

00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,520
companies are differentiating on and if

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,520
that's

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,120
the course that they choose to take they

00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,840
should have the right to do that

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,240
because the laws allow them to do that

00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,440
uh

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,720
in various jurisdictions and so um i

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,760
think you know there are

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,760
there are many good uh there's much good

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,679
evidence over the last

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:45,919
since the american events act uh in 2014

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:49,280
of uh of a world which is creating more

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:51,679
uh more quality in the patent system

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,720
and reducing the amount of noise from

00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,760
poor quality

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:59,039
uh patents uh it's not perfect but

00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,840
uh i think if uh if individuals continue

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,520
to work

00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:07,120
uh in washington and uh at the uh

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:11,039
with dg comp and uh

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:14,559
and uh in europe and mafcom and other

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:17,840
other uh bodies around the world to

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:19,280
ensure that there's less and less noise

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,200
and also obviously work with the

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,240
patented trademark offices

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,919
uh uh it's very important that we work

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,360
together to create

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:32,080
a good uh definition of what uh

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,799
of what is uh a patentable subject

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:35,120
matter

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,000
and so as an aside i think it's great

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,120
when companies

00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
uh share their views with uh with

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,440
government to

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,640
uh to try to create a better environment

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,400
um and more definition uh that helps

00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:52,000
with quality uh

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:55,200
around the patent system and so

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,039
um the patent freedom

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,240
that we're providing for open source

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,440
projects

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:04,480
uh is very much um

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,400
parallel to the uh collaborative

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,520
development work that goes on inside

00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,840
these projects

00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,679
uh and project and that are managed by

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,559
these project management organizations

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,400
and so

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:19,600
uh you have hundreds of very significant

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:23,200
projects thousands of total projects uh

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:25,760
and uh we have code from many many many

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,880
uh all of the entities represented here

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,320
not open adam

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,880
because none of their projects are

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:33,039
mature enough yet but uh

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,159
at some point we'll probably have code

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,159
from open atom

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,880
as well that we want to incorporate we

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,960
have many many licensees from china

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,880
uh in excess of 200 of the most

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,039
significant companies in china including

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:49,520
huawei baidu ali 10

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:52,799
cent 360 many many other companies

00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,559
uh that are included we are a global

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,720
organization

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,440
um this is just an example of some of

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,799
the representative members that we have

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:05,760
uh in the various sectors uh it's

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,880
uh quite significant uh rocket10 and

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,919
reliance geo

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:13,039
have uh operational 5g

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:16,000
built from scratch 5g networks uh

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:16,799
they're in india and japan respectively

00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,039
uh

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:20,400
you've got some of the the biggest

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:23,200
innovators

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,600
uh and leaders in in their sectors uh

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,880
represented here

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,200
canon has 86 000 patents i think by last

00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,400
count

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,559
one of the largest patent holding

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,919
companies in the world uh they're part

00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:37,200
of this community

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:40,240
uh semiconductor companies uh

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:43,280
tooling companies uh are participating

00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,080
and obviously fintech uh we're

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,720
supporting

00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,400
and include hyper ledger code in the

00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,360
linux system definition

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,960
uh and have uh uh are just about to

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,799
announce that two

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,640
money center banks one from north

00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:59,840
america and one from europe

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:03,200
we'll also be joining our our community

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:06,559
uh uh for those of you who are not aware

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:09,200
uh ant is the ant financials the manager

00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:12,000
of the uh

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,679
the alipay network and the wechat pay

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,240
network is managed by

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,240
tencent these are the two largest uh

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,400
combined the two largest platforms in

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,880
the world for mobile payments

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,559
uh in excess of two billion uh

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,120
transactions a day

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,000
are recorded in china on those those

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,640
networks

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,640
and union pay uh is the bank that does

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,440
all the clearing for those transactions

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,120
and these are

00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,880
these are entities that are relying

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,200
heavily on open source

00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,520
uh and our participants in the oin

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:45,600
community where they're recognizing that

00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:48,480
that they need to uh to to conform to

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,080
uh a set of norms that really oin is

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,039
establishing around appropriate

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,159
behavior uh in the use of patents in an

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:56,880
open source setting

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,080
and context uh even companies you know

00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,960
very surprising

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,279
uh when i first met with caterpillar and

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,400
and

00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,600
kamatsu and others just uh five or six

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,960
years ago

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,760
but they were really starting to

00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,760
understand and very very solicitous

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,799
to understand how they could start to

00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,960
utilize

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,919
more software to be able to create safer

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,559
environments

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,120
for the operators uh and in some cases

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,840
to

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,440
to supplant the operation uh where uh

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,360
it's particularly dangerous

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:29,440
uh where uh where risk is uh is common

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,360
associated with the use of heavy

00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,760
equipment and they are

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,880
participants in our community and and

00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,760
very uh

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,720
deeply committed to uh increasing

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,159
software

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:44,080
intensity in their products um

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,640
and then obviously in the energy sector

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:49,520
uh lf energy

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,799
is a driver in these kinds of companies

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,720
participating

00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,559
and we expect that this will be a

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,120
significant growth area

00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,760
uh into the future just as the banking

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,000
community

00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,919
financial services we'll see a lot of

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,400
growth over the next year in terms of

00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,919
adoption of open source code and then

00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,720
participation in uh

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,200
in the oin community as a recognition

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,520
that this

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,640
is part and parcel of uh of the

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,480
opportunity

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,880
opportunities and open source have

00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,840
obligations it's a social movement

00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,559
and uh part of that that obligation is

00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,480
to

00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,880
to behave well from a copyright

00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:27,039
standpoint to utilize tools and

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:30,159
processes that are being developed to

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,880
to maintain compliance uh at the same

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,159
time

00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,279
uh on the patent side uh to uh to

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,120
participate

00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,400
as a citizen of the community an

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,480
appropriate way

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,880
uh because at the end of the day the

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,080
only companies that don't join the oan

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,960
community

00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,880
uh are companies that are uh that wish

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,720
to reserve the right to sue on core

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,000
linux and associated open source

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,840
functionality

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,440
and i don't think uh when a company

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,200
looks hard in the mirror

00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,559
uh that there are many that should be

00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,600
answering that question in the

00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,640
affirmative

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,360
uh but uh but nonetheless you know 3400

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,919
is

00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,039
is a significant number of companies

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,200
participating

00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,360
but uh but we continue to grow and

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,919
continue to look for more companies

00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,039
to recognize that their interests are in

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,960
collaboration

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:20,640
on the legal front just as they are in

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,640
collaboration on the technical front

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,240
there are a number of reasons to join

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,120
many of them are

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,640
implicit in what i've just described uh

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,520
obviously the fact that it's that

00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,080
there's zero

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,960
monetary cost is very significant for

00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,400
companies

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,159
particularly small to medium-sized

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,600
companies of which we have

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:42,559
literally thousands uh in our community

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,360
um but the patent risk mitigation issues

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,880
i think

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,640
are our role in safeguarding uh patent

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,559
the companies that are adopting open

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,679
source code and enabling them to feel

00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,400
more comfortable

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,320
as they move into uh becoming more

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,400
software centric and more open source

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,840
centric as a result

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:04,960
this is one of the the key benefits uh

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,880
and uh that adoption is something that

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,120
that's really been central to the growth

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,640
of i think the linux foundation

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,480
and the other project management

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,440
organizations that i mentioned

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,720
uh i think you know 11 12 years or 13

00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,960
years ago

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:24,799
you really had very little

00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:27,919
um uh professional management i'd say

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:29,120
uh of of projects at the level that you

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,919
find it now i think

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:34,320
uh we've always had very significant

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,159
sophisticated projects uh

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,600
but i think there was there was a

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,559
transition point

00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,520
uh when eclipse and and linux foundation

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,640
uh

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:48,320
started to become really focused on

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:50,880
on the curating projects uh

00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,880
and working with companies in ways that

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,240
they were perhaps

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:58,000
not comfortable in working uh before uh

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:00,320
in participating in projects as

00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,520
aggressively and as actively as they do

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,600
but now you see no barriers

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,279
to companies participating and no

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,240
barriers to their adoption

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:11,679
and oin plays no small role in ensuring

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,159
the latter

00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,039
as we are there to specifically

00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,080
encourage

00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:21,120
adoption and and remove a fear

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,360
the fear of litigation um that

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,640
that companies have faced and again

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,120
paying a uh

00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,399
a duty or a tax for adoption of open

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,720
source code

00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:33,279
and so in addition we provide defensive

00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,600
support we work with many entities

00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,480
uh uh we've worked with the gnome

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,919
foundation

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,039
in the last couple of years when they

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:44,399
were uh being uh sued by

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,919
uh the rothschild patent troll uh and we

00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:48,080
work with them in the background

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,120
i think you know they did an excellent

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,679
job

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,360
uh from the director uh all the way

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,240
through that foundation they did an

00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,960
excellent job

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,080
in working with outside counsel securing

00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,880
outside council

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,039
drawing community support and uh and

00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,880
managing that to a very very successful

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:07,360
result

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,279
but it just shows what working together

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,600
and collaboration can do

00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:13,200
uh when when you're at risk or in

00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,240
litigation and so

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:20,000
we've supported well over 50

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:22,159
uh litigation or assertion activities

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,840
where we are coming to the aid of

00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,000
companies that are being sued or

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:30,240
asserted against

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:34,799
on by patent holders seeking to

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:39,039
to be able to extract returns

00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:41,919
and we have worked with the community

00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:43,279
to be able to identify prior art we have

00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,600
uh

00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,320
been involved in as one of the leaders

00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,960
in uh

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,399
in the us and utilizing the pre-issuance

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,080
submission program

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,000
attacking poor quality patent

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,240
applications that are overly broad and

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,279
potentially dangerous if granted

00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:01,919
uh we have identified uh prior art

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:03,120
from the community uh to be able to

00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,640
transfer that to

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,440
patent examiners so that they could

00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:11,200
reject patent applications outright

00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,679
or at least scale back the scope of uh

00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,039
of the patent claims the patent

00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,360
application claims

00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,880
before granting patents that weren't

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,960
outright rejected

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,640
and so uh this has been an important

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,440
part of our activity

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,880
uh in addition we have been working with

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,200
uh

00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,520
we brought together uh what would have

00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,640
been very strange bedfellows five or six

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,679
years ago

00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,520
uh but we brought together um two very

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:41,039
significant operating companies

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:43,760
uh ibm and microsoft to work with us

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:44,399
and the linux foundation uh to be able

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,760
to

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:50,559
uh engage in in authoring uh

00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:53,279
founding the uh the open source zone

00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:55,200
under unified patents which is an entity

00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,320
that performs a significant amount of

00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,840
work uh

00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:02,480
reducing risk in various zones uh

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,840
in establishing the open source zone uh

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,880
they have uh

00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,279
uh they have been working uh to be able

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,200
to

00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:14,880
uh uh invalidate poor quality patents

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:17,279
held by uh non-practicing entities

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,640
uh that were you being used in

00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:21,679
litigation

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:24,880
uh there are literally over a dozen

00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:28,080
uh situations that they've intervened

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,919
to be able to uh reduce risk associated

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:34,080
with non-practicing entity

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:36,240
uh held assets that read on linux system

00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,679
linux uh and open source related

00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,159
functionality

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,320
and so uh that's been a very uh

00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,399
important relationship for us

00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,519
and one that's helped in our

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,559
transformation

00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:50,720
from looking primarily at uh

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,000
since our foundation founding looking

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,120
primarily at

00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,120
operating company risk to now pivoting

00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:59,039
over the last two years since microsoft

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,440
became a participant in our community

00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,480
to focusing a significant amount of

00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,440
attention on

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,399
on non-practicing entity risk as more

00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,039
and more companies

00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,600
recognize their uh their fortunes rise

00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,880
and fall

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,240
with open source uh and software in

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,159
general uh

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:20,240
there's been a level of a natural

00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,440
uh reduction of risk associated with

00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,519
operating companies

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,799
there still are operating company uh

00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,240
risks out there

00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:31,600
that we are working to uh to uh

00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,960
diffuse but at the same time we

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,600
recognize that

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,080
uh patents are being sold and continuing

00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,399
to be

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,320
sold by operating companies that can can

00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:41,279
no longer use them in this in this

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,320
context

00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:45,919
to third parties uh and generally

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:48,240
non-practicing entities

00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,519
that will look to uh to utilize the

00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,559
patents to sue

00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,760
and extract rents from the open source

00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,600
community

00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,279
or whom whichever targets they can

00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,000
ultimately find and so

00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,640
open source is just is not necessarily

00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,120
their

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,519
their maybe their prime directive since

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:08,640
they are equal opportunity litigants

00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,720
uh but uh but nonetheless uh because

00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,760
open source is so successful

00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:14,960
uh you know it it is uh it is becoming

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,720
increasingly a target from

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,200
non-practicing entities

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,360
and that's why what we're doing with uh

00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,159
with unified is so important

00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,960
uh to be able to balance and can

00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,039
complement

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,640
what we do before patents are granted

00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:31,519
the pre-issuance program

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,279
we're working also after patents are are

00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,919
granted to be able to ensure that they

00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,840
are

00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,440
uh that risk is mitigated associated

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,960
with them the other thing that's that's

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,039
really happened over there

00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,640
yeah sorry to interrupt we're just uh

00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,919
almost at time we've got four minutes

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,200
for questions and we've had several

00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,279
questions from the audience

00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,159
okay uh i hope you just forgive me

00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,159
interrupting you there too

00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,039
great so the first question is about

00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,559
research facilities that hold patents

00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,600
and whether or not they're eligible to

00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:00,960
join the oin

00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,159
as well yes individuals research

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,000
facilities

00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:09,599
um we've had all manner of participants

00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,359
from one-person organizations uh to

00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,879
to you know obviously the largest

00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:15,359
organizations in the world

00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:17,040
but we encourage entities like cern and

00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,560
others to you know we'd love to have

00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,240
that kind of participation

00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,399
from company from entities that have

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,119
really been driving the edge of open

00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:27,280
source for

00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:28,879
for decades great that's nice and clear

00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,280
and another question from the audience

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:34,399
was do oin members they say

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,000
still sue non-oin members over linux

00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:38,240
related patents i'm not familiar with

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,159
the history of that but uh

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:42,240
are you familiar with cases where

00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,399
non-oin members have been

00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:48,480
sued by oin members over patents

00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:51,440
relating to the linux system

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,440
we're an oan

00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,000
i know of a couple of cases where oin

00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,800
members have sued each other but not on

00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000
open source functionality

00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:04,320
and so i mean oracle google

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,320
as an example but that was about open

00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,760
source functionality and i don't know of

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,880
cases where

00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,839
and a company in the oin community has

00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:15,040
sued somebody

00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:18,400
on open source grounds uh

00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,040
a suit a non-participant uh that could

00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,359
happen

00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,960
because they're not they're not buying

00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:25,760
into the same

00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,400
compact if you will the same obligations

00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,359
the same

00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,680
belief system um and they're creating

00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:33,440
their own vulnerability we can't control

00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,079
that but it could happen but i don't

00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:39,119
know of cases where it has happened

00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:42,560
okay thank you another question is

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:46,160
um why not extend the oin pledge

00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:48,480
to require that members either simply

00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,640
don't sue at all over the patents that

00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,440
they hold relating to the linux system

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,839
or that at least they will not sue open

00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,240
source

00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:57,040
projects whatever definition that might

00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,920
have

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,880
why why not extend uh the freedom as it

00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:03,440
were in that way

00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,320
well i think the the the former kind of

00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,520
comment it

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:10,800
it does you are prevented from suing

00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:14,320
uh with your patents another entity

00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,359
on linux system grounds within the

00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,200
community

00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,800
and so the idea is to create a bigger

00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:20,240
community so that there are fewer and

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,200
fewer people that are outside the

00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,880
community

00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,520
people that are outside the community i

00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,359
guess the question is should we be

00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,200
preventing people inside the community

00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:30,720
from suing anyone outside the community

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,280
even if they haven't joined

00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,560
well i mean that they should join

00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:38,320
because it's free

00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:41,680
and because why do we want to inoculate

00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:43,680
people who don't have shared values

00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,599
and are not willing to do the same thing

00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:50,240
that everyone else has done if

00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:53,520
ibm with whatever 60 000 patents and

00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,000
huawei with 40 000 patents i mean some

00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,000
of these are

00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:58,240
these are massive companies that are

00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,160
that are pledging their portfolios

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,839
so why would we protect someone who

00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,680
doesn't want to take that that minimal

00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:05,040
step

00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:06,880
in the interest of fairness then from

00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,680
from that perspective yeah

00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:12,079
we don't want to see litigation uh but

00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:15,440
at the same time we want to see people

00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:23,839
sharing the same values

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:23,839
yep thank you

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,520
