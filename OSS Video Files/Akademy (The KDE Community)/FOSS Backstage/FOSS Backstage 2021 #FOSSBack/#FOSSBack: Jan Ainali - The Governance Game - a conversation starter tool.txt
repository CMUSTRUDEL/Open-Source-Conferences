Title: #FOSSBack: Jan Ainali - The Governance Game - a conversation starter tool
Publication date: 2021-03-02
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Governance is important, but unless you start out with a really clear vision, it might be hard to get everyone on the same page. People join projects at various times and when the project is small, governance is often not a top priority. Governance usually becomes a priority ex-post, or when a project is already in full implementation. So how do you get agreement and a common understanding on the governance of your codebase? If it wasn't already clear, chances are that people will have different views on what the status quo is. And if discussions are started based on different premises, misunderstandings are bound to happen. That is why we created the Governance Game. The Governance Game (https://github.com/publiccodenet/governance-game) is a fun way to explore how organisations can maintain shared and collaborative open content together. It can help you and your community to start talking about various aspects of governance, and highlight potential pitfalls. In this session we'll show you a few different ways of how you can use this game to enhance your project.

	00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:07,520
so

00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,280
hello i'm jan einelli i am a code based

00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,519
steward at the foundation for

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,360
public code and after me we're going to

00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,080
hear from my colleague eric

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,160
about what we do as well but essentially

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,119
we're helping public organizations

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,240
collaborate

00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:26,080
when they are developing uh software

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:29,199
and when you do collaborations uh

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:32,079
you're gonna need end up with needy of

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,200
uh governance and unless you start out

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,200
with a very clear

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,800
vision it might be hard to get everyone

00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,879
on the same page

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,559
people join the code base at various

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,040
times and when you start

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,000
you usually don't prioritize governance

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:48,480
because it's

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,680
just you and your team so

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,360
it usually becomes a priority after you

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,559
really need it and when

00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:59,199
it is already in full implementation

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,199
and if it wasn't already clear it is a

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,840
very good chance that people have

00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,799
different views of what the status quo

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,880
is

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,240
and if destruction discussions are

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,640
started

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,000
uh with different premises

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,400
misunderstandings are

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,680
bound to happen so how do you get

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,680
agreement

00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,680
and a common understanding of code base

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,880
yeah so that's why we at the foundation

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,680
for public code

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,560
created the governance game and the

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,840
governance game

00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,840
is a card game

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:35,600
and yes if you can get that in a large

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,439
view there so it's a game designed to

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,360
get people talking about

00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:44,479
governance in in a setup and it includes

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,439
different starting states which have a

00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,000
variety of different actors and the

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,759
actors

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,040
can be public organizations civil

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,079
servants steering groups

00:01:53,040 --> 00:02:01,040
and such and to make it more real

00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:01,040
we also added a few scenario cards which

00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,439
gives you they are based on real

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,280
situations

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,200
to give you a little bit of a trick and

00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,239
the purpose is to get a consensus

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:16,480
of how the governance in this project

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:18,959
should work and it is a co-op game

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,879
so the only way to really lose is if you

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,280
cannot agree at all

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,239
and to make it a little bit more tricky

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,280
we added

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,760
a few calamities things that might

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,680
happen

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,319
you find a bug or there are some other

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,120
concerns and such

00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,000
and when we designed this we thought

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,040
this is a

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,360
great exercise to get used to talk about

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,160
governance

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,040
but it's also really good to to actually

00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,040
evaluate

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:52,000
your current code base so you can

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,080
remove the starting state you can remove

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,120
the scenario because that's your real

00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,319
case and instead you will map

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,480
out the

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,400
all the actors that is in your project

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,519
and try to figure out what are the

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,680
responsibilities

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,519
between these and what are the

00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,680
relationship and dependencies and even

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,000
better if you put the paper underneath

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,000
and draw a little bit that'll be really

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
good because it's make it less

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,040
abstract than just word on what the

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,519
governance is

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,319
so you can really get into hands-on and

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,519
see

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,519
how it actually is using or how you're

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,760
actually using your governance

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,360
and this might lead that you want to

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,360
change your governance

00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,799
or it might just lead that everybody has

00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,680
a clear view of

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,519
how it's really working now we made this

00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,080
about this time last year

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,440
and thought hey being hands-on is good

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,599
but then the pandemic happened

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,280
so we have developed a little bit of an

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,680
online version where these are sort of

00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,840
digital tokens where you move around

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,519
it's not as intuitive as moving cards

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,200
because people have a really good mental

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,599
model of how to do that

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,799
but but it works and it unlocks another

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,760
potential

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,920
it makes it possible to collaborate with

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,360
all the people in your code base

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,360
even if they're scattered around the

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,040
world so perhaps you couldn't even

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,000
travel and get everyone to travel to the

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,280
same page

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:18,560
place so we hope you will try this out

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,199
it's on github available so and it's

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,000
free and open source i'm posting the

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,120
link right

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,720
now in the chat and

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,720
try and use it and contribute back and

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,360
improve on it if you like to

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:43,840
and hopefully you'll have a few laughs

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:43,840
along the way as well

00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,320
