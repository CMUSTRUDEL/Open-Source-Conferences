Title: #FOSSBack: Leslie Hawthorn - Love in the Time of Corona: Parenting, Pandemic, and Professionalism
Publication date: 2021-02-23
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Adapting to the "new normal" of defaulting to working from home, while simultaneously providing care - or schooling - for children, elders and other family members, all whilst attempting to maintain our own career success and preserve our mental health in the face of enormous stressors has been -- well, let's be honest, it has been sucktastic. 

In this presentation, I will do some real talk about love during Coronazeit: love for our families, love for ourselves, and how to best show empathy to our colleagues who are somehow making it work under near-impossible circumstances. I will also discuss the disproportionate struggles of professional women during the pandemic, and how the increased demand for 'emotional labor' in these times has led to increased burnout, flight of women from the workforce, and limitations to women's future career growth opportunities. 

Audience members will leave with a greater understanding of small ways they can each provide better care to themselves and their communities. We are all in this together and can only prosper when we are committed to mutual support.

good day

00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,240
everyone i'm really pleased to have you

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,679
here joining me for this presentation

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,440
here at frost backstage

00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,360
uh this is my third frost backstage

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:16,400
obviously the first virtual one

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,480
um i wanted to start

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,600
my opening remarks by letting everyone

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,400
in the audience know that one of the

00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,880
reasons why

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,720
i felt particularly responsible

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,960
for for bringing these messages to our

00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,000
community is i recognize my own enormous

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,559
privilege

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,840
in that uh you know i am uh i am a white

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:35,920
well-educated woman

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,120
working in the tech industry and

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,079
therefore

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,840
uh when i am facing the challenges of uh

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,200
living in corona times

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,520
and the stresses that that brings to all

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,879
of us i'm doing so from uh from a place

00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,399
where

00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,239
my position is relatively safe and

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:51,920
secure though though my life may be

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,039
difficult and i wanted to give voice to

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,440
some of the experiences that other folks

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,840
are having who are not in a position to

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,520
be able to critique the system or the

00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,879
uh the modality in which they operate

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,479
because they do not have that same

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,080
privilege themselves

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,760
um just a couple quick words about

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,000
myself um

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,159
i am currently working as a manager in

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,920
red hat's open source program office

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,439
i've been working in the open source

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,880
space for

00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,640
almost 20 years now and um this talk is

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,920
just me sharing my own personal

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,479
experiences

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,280
as a parent in the times of corona this

00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,920
isn't any

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,280
uh reflection of my uh employer's

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,799
thoughts on the matter although

00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,119
i guarantee there will probably be a

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,240
couple of love letters to uh to red hat

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,200
during this talk just because i think

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,320
that the way that they've handled

00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,759
working with their employees during the

00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,479
pandemic has been

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,000
super so to get into the meat of our

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,840
presentation for today

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,320
um it should come as no surprise to

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,119
anyone uh that we live in very tender

00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,479
times

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:53,360
um life is very very difficult

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,399
right now and it's not simply the global

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,600
pandemic

00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,000
um even before we were all

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,759
uh putting our lives on hold and

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,640
adjusting to the new normal that is

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,320
uh the coronavirus the uh the world was

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,720
a very challenging place to live in

00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,160
to begin with right we had a global

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,840
civil unrest

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,760
including in places where i think many

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,440
folks didn't expect to see civil unrest

00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,360
occurring such as in the united states

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,800
where i'm originally from

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,480
uh we had uh global trade wars

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:28,319
escalating we were noticing the strains

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,000
of uh the uh globalization impact and

00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,599
how that had stretched our supply chains

00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,280
and as we searched for economies of

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,440
scale that left our ability to be

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,920
resilient in times of crisis

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,160
uh impaired and then so so that all sort

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,040
of exploded and was brought together

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,720
when um when in fact a moment of crisis

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,319
challenged that overall resilience to

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,560
our global systems

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,080
and now here we are living uh you know

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,640
through a global pandemic while

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,200
in the meantime all the other sources we

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,080
may have had of sort of existential

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,200
angst or stress remain right we're all

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,040
still wondering how we're going to

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,080
provide well for ourselves and our

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,080
families

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,080
we are all still probably concerned

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,800
about the impact of climate change

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,120
on our futures uh the number of

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,800
displaced persons worldwide continues to

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,159
grow due to climate change

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,480
um global conflict etc so

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,159
it is not as though we are only

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,920
experiencing the stress

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,760
of our changed lives and the pandemic

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,360
life was already pretty stressful to

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,720
begin with

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,400
and now in our in our new normal and my

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,920
thesis is actually that we have reached

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,920
we have reached an almost impossible

00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,640
challenge as individuals

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,159
in order to simply cope with the the

00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,080
stresses of our daily life

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,000
and hopefully throughout the course of

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,599
this presentation in addition to

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,159
bringing to light some of those

00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:49,280
challenges i will also be able to give

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:52,319
shares some ways to

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,319
this is not staged i promise

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,920
okay beloved i am right in the middle of

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,280
giving a talk about

00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,959
parenting when your little one is at

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,400
home because of corona

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,760

00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,480
tony said like the exit

there take plenty of time off these

00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,120
pieces okay

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,199

you're going to look right on your mouth

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,639
here is a demonstration of love

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,000
and parenting in the time of corona for

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,400
the sake of actually being able to

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,160
continue this presentation

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,600
i'm going to go help her out real quick

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,080
and come right back and i

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,680
am very sorry to everyone who is

00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,040
participating in the live stream excuse

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,040
me i will return postfix

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,840
parenting crises shown here actual size

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,080
thanks everyone for your patience

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,120
um so as i was saying before my untimely

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,360
departure

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,120
um hopefully throughout the course of

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,720
this presentation in addition to

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,639
identifying some of the

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,479
challenges that many of us are facing

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,960
and helping to

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,160
create some empathetic uh interactions

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,680
around those challenges

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,199
we'll also talk about ways that we can

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,800
help build resilience in ourselves and

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,560
in our communities as we face this

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,080
nearly impossible challenge

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,680
so one of the goals that i have with

00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,919
this talk is actually to make

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,039
to make the invisible visible and what i

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,440
mean by that is

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,440
um i think we've all read enough think

00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,680
pieces about how

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,280
we have zoom fatigue and we are

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,960
exhausted by only meeting

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,880
folks on video and we don't have the

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,240
same sort of dopamine reaction

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:48,800
with uh video-based

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,240
communications as we do with in-person

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,160
interactions and how that is

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,000
is causing um a global level of

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,800
exhaustion in how we interact with one

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,120
another

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,880
i think we've all read uh the articles

00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,400
talking about how

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,880
um there's been an increase in

00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,400
uh job loss economic disturbance around

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,840
the virus etc

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,520
like we we have an understanding that

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,000
these things are going on but if they

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,440
don't

00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,440
if these problems aren't necessarily

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,759
directly impacting us i don't think we

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,960
have a good sense of

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:22,240
what it means to have these these

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,360
particular experiences

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,120
and and one thing that has deeply rooted

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,160
in my own experience of living through

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,759
corona

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,520
was a talk i had very early on with a

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,039
good friend of mine about

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,360
the challenges that i was facing as a

00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,360
parent and um how

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,039
how my time was bifurcated and it was

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,240
very hard to focus and

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,160
all the same things that many other

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,840
people are experiencing and

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,199
and her response was to say i think that

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,479
this is the first time that people

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,919
really understand what it's been like

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,840
for me my whole life living with a

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,479
disabled spouse

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,599
and that to me was extremely profound

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,440
right the

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,880
i had known this person for many many

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,560
years and i had known that they had a

00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,319
disabled spouse and i was sympathetic to

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,759
that but i did not have any kind of

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,319
understanding of what that meant on a

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,840
day-to-day basis for that person's life

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,400
because i had never experienced it it

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,160
wasn't because i lacked sympathy or care

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,759
it was because there was no real way to

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,199
have that understanding having not lived

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,720
through it myself

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,560
and so that i'm hoping that by sharing

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,919
some of these stories today i will be

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,639
able to make those invisible things

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,400
visible

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:24,319
and tangible to each of us as an

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,319
exercise in growing our empathy

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,080
so here we are in days where um

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,400
to say that child care options are

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,720
scarce i think is a generous way to put

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,199
it

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,960
um uh we are in a in a situation where

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,639
for the first time uh there are many

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,080
many people worldwide who are doing

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,160
their work where possible

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,919
from the the comfort and safety of their

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,840
homes but they're also doing

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,840
it where there are no actual resources

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,720
to help them care for their offspring

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,520
and

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,960
this is this is considerably challenging

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,160
because you get interrupted while you're

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,319
giving presentations at great

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,080
conferences like foss backstage

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,840
or you're simply in a constantly

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,720
interrupt-driven environment because you

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,680
have the

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,639
to handle the needs of your children uh

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,960
while handling

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,800
your own needs as a person without the

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,400
usual resources you may call upon in

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,639
order to make your precious time

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,319
resources stretch farther such as

00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,919
being able to go out to eat for a meal

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,800
instead of cooking it at home yourself

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,840
or

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,960
being reliant upon other

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,479
child care options that are no longer

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,080
available to you because you can't

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,199
invite someone over to watch your kids

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,479
in the afternoon if you have an

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,840
important meeting

00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,680
because that's just simply not something

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,320
we're doing anymore so

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,959
i and i and i bring this this point to

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,640
the fore

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,880
because i think we're all probably not

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,080
used to um somebody's kid bouncing into

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,839
one of our meetings and

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,839
and being really um you know hopefully

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,200
generous and accepting of that as as

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,680
part of our new normal

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:55,200
but what i i think is invisible to some

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:58,880
extent is the uh just the enormous

00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,760
mental pressure that comes with

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,040
the feeling that you're uh you're in a

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,160
position where

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,279
you are not able to give the amount of

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,640
presence that you want to to your

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,920
children and you're not able to get the

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,680
amount of presence that you want to to

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,120
your work and that you are you are uh

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,120
effectively failing at both of your

00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,200
endeavors right which can be

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,240
uh have a really negative psychological

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,399
impact

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,519
on an individual because you know we are

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,680
creatures who like

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,120
to succeed and where we feel like we are

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:27,440
trapped in a situation where we can

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,760
cannot succeed because we cannot do well

00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,959
for

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,040
either side um it can be uh

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:36,080
exhausting and a drain on our mental

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:39,519
health resources

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,560
um and additionally i don't want to um

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,120
to suggest at all that the only folks

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,000
who are

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,120
are struggling with care

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,040
responsibilities are those who are

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,240
caring for children i myself am caring

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,480
for children but i also have several

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,760
elder care responsibilities as well

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,920
and i know folks who have uh much deeper

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,200
elder care responsibilities

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,080
um to to parents or other agent loved

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,600
ones

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:03,680
and you know one of the stories that i

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,120
wanted to to share today was my um

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,560
my red hat mentor actually um at the

00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,640
start of the pandemic

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,000
uh his family made the choice to have

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,839
his his father

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,040
move in to their home because they were

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,160
concerned

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:21,920
that he would not uh be as safe

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:24,640
living in a senior citizen's center

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,279
and so not only was their family coping

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,000
with

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,519
the need to bring the children into the

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,240
home adjust to homeschooling

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,600
a whole bunch of different

00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,120
responsibilities there but

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,720
simultaneously

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,360
now elder care responsibilities were a

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,880
part of that and all within the scope of

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,240
a home that was never

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,839
designed nor anticipated to be one in

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,240
which there would be another adult

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,680
living

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:49,680
in that location um and there's also

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,800
something to be said for the

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:56,000
the overall again talking about items of

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,320
um overarching

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,240
concern you know as we look at news

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,839
reports about what is happening uh

00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,360
worldwide

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,880
with the state of the infrastructure

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,120
that's meant to care for

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,120
our elderly populations those

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,720
infrastructure resources are straining

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,200
the the businesses that have uh chosen

00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,959
to be

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,279
in the area of caring for senior

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:20,160
citizens have found themselves

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,519
uh financially devastated due to the

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,640
requirements for coping with the

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,760
pandemic that have

00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,760
exponentially increased costs while the

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,200
folks that they care for are on on a

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,440
fixed income and there's a

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,920
an op there's a very good chance there's

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,880
going to be some huge destabilization

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,640
in our ability to rely on uh social

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,920
infrastructure that has been created to

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,800
care for

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,600
uh the elders in our lives so you know

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,360
again

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,360
the uh the impact of the pandemic is not

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,959
just about our our youngest

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,120
most vulnerable members of our society

00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,800
it's about our elders and

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,839
who are on the other end of the spectrum

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,480
of most vulnerable members of our

00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,959
society

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,360
um additionally you know as we are

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,440
facing all of these challenges

00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,079
um i would say mental health care

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,040
resources are scarce or non-existent

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,639
um as somebody who believes that mental

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,000
health care with uh you know

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,120
professional service is an extremely

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,519
important part of my own

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:17,680
self-care regimen um you know i am

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,880
fortunate in that i had access to mental

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,079
health care resources

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:25,839
prior to uh corona ever

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:28,160
becoming a part of our lives and yet

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,240
i know many many people who because of

00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,800
the pandemic they felt very emotionally

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,600
and healthy and secure prior to all of

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,040
the changes

00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,639
now that these changes have taken place

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,040
they are looking for additional support

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,560
and

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,200
help around their mental health and

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:44,240
well-being and unsurprisingly

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:46,399
there are not sufficiently available

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,959
trained professional resources to cope

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,880
with the increased demand

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,720
for mental health care that have come

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,720
about because of the pandemics so while

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,360
we are now coping with

00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,000
extreme stressors completely different

00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,519
new

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,200
different situations than we were used

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,079
to to handling an

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,160
unprecedented change in the way of you

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:08,560
know just going about our daily life

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,120
in a time when we were all fairly

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,200
stressed even before corona came to us

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,200
this is this is then something that is

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,680
is hugely devastating

00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,040
um to folks because when you find that

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,399
you are in need of care

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,560
and you go to ask for it and then

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,480
suddenly discover it is not available

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,279
that is um it's just it's a dire

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,279
situation to be in

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,360
um and while we're talking about the the

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,040
challenges faced by folks during the

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,320
times of corona i want to be really

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,440
clear um

00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,720
that the the impact of the pandemic has

00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,839
disproportionately

00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,199
disenfranchised and negatively affected

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,560
women um

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:46,480
hands down so if we look at our

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,160
life outside of the time of the pandemic

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,920
i think it's it's pretty clear and very

00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,920
very well documented

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,279
um that you know household work or the

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,760
domestic economy

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,279
falls disproportionately to women you

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,240
know the expectation is that women will

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,959
do

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,800
much of the household labor um as

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:06,079
opposed to their uh

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,079
their male partners and you know that

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,360
was a difficult situation which i think

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,720
a lot of folks in society were

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,399
attempting to negotiate

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,760
for for quite a while and looking to

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,199
bring about positive change but in the

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,720
wake of the pandemic

00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:20,639
the strain that that creates has become

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,079
that much more manifest um you know i

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,560
remember

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,560
at the very start of lockdowns back in

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:28,560
march of last year

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,800
i mean i would literally spend five

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,440
hours a day doing laundry

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,279
just because if we left the house to go

00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,040
get groceries

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,480
you know every single article of

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,000
clothing clothing needed to be cleaned

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,079
we all took a shower you know this was

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,120
the current guidance and

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,639
having that and that was simply one

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,240
of the household tasks that needed to be

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,160
done now add on to that

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,360
cooking three meals a day when before

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,160
one might have gotten

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,440
take out food or not needed to do that

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,120
because people would be outside of the

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,639
home for some of those meals and that

00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,920
was not a responsibility that fell to

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,680
someone in the home

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,040
uh you know keeping the place clean

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,240
making sure that there are clean dishes

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,079
etc

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,279
all of this disproportionately impacts

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,279
women because women are

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:10,800
are typically expected to be the ones in

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,199
the household who are doing that work to

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,680
begin with and it is not as though

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,519
uh more time resources suddenly became

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,360
available in women's lives at the start

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,720
of the pandemic to take on all of these

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,440
increased care responsibilities

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,199
there's also the um unfortunate fact

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,000
that what we we look at as short-term

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,519
challenges

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,680
um are actually incredibly negatively

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,240
impactful to women's careers long-term

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,279
so we are seeing a record number of

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,199
women

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,360
uh leaving the workforce in order to

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,240
stay at home and perform care work for

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,839
children or

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,440
for aged relatives uh

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,199
more often than not women are the ones

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,040
making the sacrifices when it comes to

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,000
their careers as opposed to their male

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,320
partners

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,680
in some cases that is because other male

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,000
partners earn more

00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,920
because of the well-documented wage gap

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,480
between men and women's earnings

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,199
so we have a systemic problem of the

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,639
wage gap

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:08,320
coming in and impacting women's ability

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,040
to be successful in the future

00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,639
because since the wage gap existed and

00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,519
their labor has been valued less

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,880
economically

00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,560
they're there for the ones to drop out

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,160
of the workforce and then

00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:22,720
take the economic hit of then trying to

00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,680
re-enter the workforce later

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,800
competing for jobs when those jobs are

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,160
able to be taken by

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,240
several folks who want to re-enter the

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,759
workforce potentially

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,600
not having the opportunity to go back to

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,000
the same work or at the same level of

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,959
seniority as they did before

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,160
and even for those who do not drop out

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,839
of the workforce who remain in

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,639
professional employment

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,240
they're just simply not the same set of

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:50,560
opportunities available to you

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:53,040
when you are um trying to

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,560
uh do your do your best to be an

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,199
effective human being during your global

00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,040
pandemic

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,680
um you know just sharing my own

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:03,680
experience i've been

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:06,079
working very hard on a management track

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,679
promotion at red hat for a while now

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,799
working in concert with my manager we

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,919
had a great plan

00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,520
several projects that we were going to

00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,559
complete stuff to execute that's

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:16,240
fantastic

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:18,160
and i've chosen um to de-prioritize

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:20,640
working on a promotion track

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,240
this year because simply because it is

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,880
not possible for me

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,199
to do the kind of work required to

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,200
advocate for my ability to be promoted

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,640
okay so that's fair and that's a and

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,559
that's a choice that i've made and it's

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,520
a reasonable choice to make

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,840
but what that means is effectively there

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,160
are

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,960
there's going to be one to two years

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,720
where

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,880
i should have been in the ready to be

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,559
promoted ready to move my career

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,799
seniority up my earning potential up etc

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,720
that are they're simply gone and they're

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,520
simply gone because

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,160
um you know this short term challenge

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,760
actually

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,520
it ends up having a very long term

00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,039
effect because the the choice if the

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,320
choice is between

00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,880
um career trajectory versus

00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,799
family care versus the ability to

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,120
perform some sort of self-care by not

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,080
you know uh burning myself out trying to

00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,480
do too much

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,000
in a possible time you know the choice

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,799
to me is obvious right it's it's care

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,840
for my child

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:20,880
and it's uh it's care for myself so

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,640
while we are thinking through um the the

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,720
challenges that women are facing

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,480
right now today and how you know it

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,720
sucks uh to be the one

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,160
who gets interrupted during your zoom

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,919
meeting because

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,600
our you know your children more often

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,080
than not will probably ask mom where

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,080
their

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,200
uh where their tony is and not someone

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,400
else in the house

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:42,559
um it's not just the the day-to-day

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,919
uh difficulties it's that what we're

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,760
experiencing right now is going to have

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,480
long-term cumulative effects on our

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,960
careers

00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,480
and you know we're we're working and

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,799
trying to

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,480
uh do our very best to continue being

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,799
effective in this new normal

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,720
um against the backdrop of realizing

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,919
that we are taking a serious long-term

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:05,360
hit while we are struggling um

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:08,000
to make things you know work day-to-day

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,679
and i think the you know the hardest

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,080
thing for me as a professional woman and

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,400
i

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,919
and i know that i echo this i echo a

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,039
sentiment that i've heard expressed many

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,799
many times um

00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:19,360
in one-on-one conversations with friends

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:21,919
over video

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,760
no matter what you do no matter what

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,960
choice you are making

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:29,760
you are always choosing to

00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,799
either neglect your work and be less

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,880
successful there

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,240
neglect your family and be successful

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,640
there and potentially

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,280
have long-term repercussions in terms of

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,919
your

00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,120
um you know your offsprings emotional

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,200
mental health their

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,320
cognitive development et cetera and

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,400
yourself right

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,480
something no matter what is being

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,840
sacrificed and sometimes it's all three

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,760
of those things

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:55,919
um just simply to continue to maintain

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,840
and that is that is an extremely

00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,200
extremely uncomfortable position to be

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,240
in because i think

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:05,039
um given the choice uh you know

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,640
none of us would would choose to sacrif

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,120
you know would choose to neglect

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,919
those things uh and certainly for women

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,679
where you know

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:16,320
we we have uh again well documented

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,919
uh tendencies to prioritize our own

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,120
needs last

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,720
um when it comes to uh either care for

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,240
our families or making sure that we

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,919
excel in our careers

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,360
you know now we're at we're in a

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,880
position where it's not only

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,559
a question of whether or not our needs

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,240
are prioritized last it's a question of

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,120
whether we're going to meet our needs at

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,720
all

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,480
um because some of us are trying to

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,799
squeeze in our ability to get our jobs

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,320
done

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,840
at three o'clock in the morning before

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,799
the children wake up

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,760
and then you know again at 8pm at night

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,000
uh until

00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,960
you know midnight in order to get our

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,960
work done after they go to sleep so um

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:53,280
again as i've said before you know this

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,559
is this is a near impossible

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,360
challenge that we face so um so enough

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,080
gloom and doom

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,600
and enough and enough it hurts um what

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,520
is it that we can do

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,039
to to improve these matters right

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,400
they're clear there has to be a light at

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,400
the end of this tunnel it's not a train

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,799
so the first thing that i would i would

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:13,679
advocate for is to start with empathy

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,039
right when you're when you're

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,559
interacting with your colleagues and

00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,480
your your co-workers please try to be

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,559
empathetic about their situations

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,760
based on what you may know of them as

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,480
human beings or what they may have

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,280
shared with you

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,320
so you know a couple of hot takes um

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,120
gentlemen

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,640
if you are in a meeting with several of

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,640
your female colleagues whom you know

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,080
have children and whom you know

00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,080
do not have partners who uh

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,799
who do not work outside the home right

00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,760
do not do not spend five minutes of your

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:43,360
meeting ranting

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,200
about how hard it is for you when the

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,880
kids are at home when you have a partner

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,480
at home who also helps you

00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,720
with all these tasks and does not have

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,559
full-time work because it can make

00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,000
things very uncomfortable for your

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,880
female colleagues

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,320
who are navigating the exact same

00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,760
situation you are but do not have the

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,760
resources of an additional

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,120
pair of hands or partner to focus on

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,799
those domestic

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:09,679
economy needs um and also you know

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,520
for for those of us who who don't have

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,000
children who are seeing kids bounce off

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,159
the walls

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,760
during video conference meetings um

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,880
remarks like that's why i didn't have

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,799
kids

00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,480
are not super helpful um it may be true

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,120
it's not necessarily the best thing to

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,640
share at that moment in time

00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,640
and i would also like to say that you

00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,600
know for those of us who are struggling

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,799
with these additional care

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,200
responsibilities that are

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:35,039
that are new and unprecedented also

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,080
having some empathy for our colleagues

00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,000
who

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,440
are not necessarily facing that

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,799
challenge right like

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:46,640
it is very clear to me that

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:49,440
there are folks on um you know my team

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,240
or within my company who they don't have

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,360
children

00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,799
and they are working a lot harder much

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,440
much harder

00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,880
to fill the gaps that are left because

00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,039
those of us who do have

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,880
um family care responsibilities are not

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:05,039
able to give as much as we once were

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,640
right and and having some empathy and

00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,320
some kindness for the amount of stress

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,679
and pressure that they are feeling to

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,440
perform

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,720
because we are not able to give as much

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,159
as we once did i think is really

00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,760
important too and being

00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,840
and not only being empathetic and aware

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,159
of it but thanking them

00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,520
for taking that time to support us and

00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,600
and being really clear that we

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,320
know that that is happening and that we

00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,799
acknowledge it and we're grateful

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,080
um create environments where where real

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,720
talk is safe right

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,280
i am very fortunate that you know i the

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,440
the company

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,039
i work for encourages real talk and open

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,080
communication and the team that i work

00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,559
on also

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,679
values uh people bringing their whole

00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:44,320
self into the office

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,760
so i absolutely encourage folks to

00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,120
create work environments in which people

00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,000
can just be honest like if you're having

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,919
a horrible day

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,320
because you know you joined the bad moms

00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,600
club because your kid finally cut off

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,600
all of their own hair because you were

00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,600
in a call too long in the morning

00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,039
this did not just happen to me on monday

00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,200
no

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,240
right that someone can talk about that

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,520
and talk about their feelings of

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,000
insecurity they're feeling and talk

00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,520
about the

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,799
the guilt or the heart that they're

00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,000
feeling like they're neglecting their

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,279
child and they're neglecting their work

00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,400
at the same time right we need to be

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,440
able to have a place where we can

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,039
express

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,360
the truth and the reality of what we are

00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:19,520
all experiencing at this time

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:21,120
uh and because our normal social support

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,919
systems are not functioning as they once

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,679
did

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,600
so much of our social interaction is now

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,840
being driven through through our work

00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,640
and our our office our office

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,679
engagements

00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,520
so you know rethink what professionalism

00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,880
means to you and give a place for people

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:39,440
to actually just be themselves

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:43,039
and perform real talk and just continue

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,679
um normalize care responsibilities so

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:47,120
um you know i think it should be it is

00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:51,039
it is incumbent upon

00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,640
every uh workplace to make sure that it

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,360
is very very clear

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,880
that it is understood that there are

00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:00,480
care responsibilities

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,000
um that come with uh being in a pedant

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,279
and being in a pandemic and that there

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,880
are going to be times when we are going

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,400
to need to give time to

00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,080
the elders in our lives to the children

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,279
in our lives to our fellow fellow family

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,039
members etc

00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,039
even even needing to take a mental

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,880
health day because it's all just a bit

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,400
too much right and and normalizing that

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,600
that is a thing and that it

00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,360
is it is valid and that it is real um is

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,240
important right we cannot we cannot say

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,720
to everybody oh

00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,559
you know we think you're all going to do

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,559
fine and then you know

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,840
uh naked you know ping our co-workers

00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,200
and back channel and say like it's not

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,880
cool that you missed that meeting

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,640
you know we know you had such and such

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,000
happening with your you know your

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,840
grandparents but it really wasn't okay

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,080
that you were there

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,679
um last but not least if you are in a

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,000
position of leadership or management i

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:45,440
think it's

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,279
incredibly important to make uh revised

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,240
performance expectations explicit

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,600
so if if it is clear to you that you do

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,000
not expect your employees to be able to

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,080
perform the level that they normally did

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
that's great and it's wonderful to say

00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,360
that but it's also really important to

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,799
have conversations with each of your

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,279
individual employees about what they

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,520
reason

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,720
can reasonably accomplish given their

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,919
own constraints

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,360
and to make sure that they understand

00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,360
that their performance is going to be

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,640
judged according to very specific

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,400
criteria that you're going to work with

00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,320
them so that they can meet it

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,400
right um because unfortunately you

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,400
either get folks who are going to

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,000
uh exhaust themselves by trying to over

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,360
perform in a situation where they don't

00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,720
have enough resources because they're

00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,840
not sure what target they're trying to

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,799
hit

00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:28,320
right or you're going to have folks who

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,320
because they don't know what is expected

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,159
of them they're going to feel a

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,440
sense of paralysis and freezing because

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,799
they just they do not know what is

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,159
expected of them they think that they

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:38,880
have to perform as they have always

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,279
performed in challenging circumstances

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,559
and because that is a recipe that is

00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,960
doomed for failure

00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:45,679
uh they end up being not able to do

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,360
anything at all

00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,760
right so just just be really clear on

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,200
what you expect people to be able to do

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,679
and then you know it's fine to hold

00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,960
people accountable even in tough times

00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,080
but make sure that you're holding them

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,200
accountable for something that is

00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,240
reasonable

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,760
explicit and agreed upon

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,240
uh and last but not least i know this is

00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,679
silly and cliche but just

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,279
give yourself and everyone else around

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,720
you a break um

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:12,159
you know it's okay if your kid cuts off

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,760
all their own hair because you were in

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,919
meetings all day it is okay

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,200
if one of your co-workers you know

00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,200
didn't get back to you immediately it's

00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,159
okay if someone misses a meeting

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,600
it's okay if the talk that you gave at a

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,159
conference wasn't the best talk you ever

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,799
gave

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,399
um you know we are all doing the very

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,880
very best that we can

00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:32,399
and if that you know that that has to be

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,880
enough because it is all that we have to

00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:37,279
give so if you find yourself

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,120
um being really critical of other people

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,480
try to give them some grace and do your

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,840
very best to extend that grace to

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,039
yourself as well

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,159
and then the last point that i want to

00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,039
make because i think it's a really

00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:48,080
important one

00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:50,480
is um i think we all need to spend

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,760
all as human beings and as as citizens

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,520
of our respective countries and as

00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,520
citizens of this planet earth

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,880
um we need to rethink about the way we

00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,399
structure our world

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,039
um because what we have discovered in

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:04,080
this time is that our social systems

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,799
our supply chains our um economic

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,559
systems

00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:10,799
are our social safety nets right

00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:12,399
um they don't have the kind of

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,080
resiliency built into them that is

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,559
required for

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,240
uh times in which our we are facing

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,559
global challenges and we really need to

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,640
rethink about how we

00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,679
structure how we approach life in order

00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,440
to ensure that

00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,919
should we find ourselves in in these

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,080
tender times for a long period of time

00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,799
or again

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,480
that we're able to make better choices

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:37,760
that allow us to handle

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,520
adversity in a more sustainable way

00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,440
thank you all for listening and for your

00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:43,360
patience with my

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,880
interruption and i believe we may have a

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,840
minute for questions so i'm going to

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,360
turn it over to

00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,960

thank you leslie thank you very much for

00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,919
your talk

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,399
um we don't actually have any questions

00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,840
yet

00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:01,760

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,919
that they they totally understand and

you said you you hope that people will

00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,559
accept those situations and being

00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:11,279
interrupted as kind of as a normality

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,000
and our audience has truly done that and

00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:14,480
