Title: #FOSSBack: Eric Herman - How the Standard for Public Code can help you collaborate over time & space
Publication date: 2021-03-02
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Our goal is to help people developing public-purpose software understand how the Standard for Public Code can help them collaborate. The Standard is of course applicable to everyone developing open source software, and is especially useful if you want other organizations to be able to contribute to your code.

By applying the Standard, code created for and by governments will not only be reusable and open source on paper, but also in practice. We hope to show that it is not that hard to create genuinely reusable code, and inspire collaboration across public organizations.

The talk will also answer the following questions:

    What is public code?
    Why the need for a Standard for Public Code?

The talk will show how the Foundation for Public Code is already applying the Standard to some codebases, and how this has helped those communities.

	00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,960
hello there thank you

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,000
um so yes thanks for attending the

00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,759
lightning talk here

00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,679
talking about collaboration over time

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,759
and space

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,160
first off my name is eric i am a

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,520
developer have been doing so for

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:25,279
a couple of decades now and presently

00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:28,640
i'm working with and collaborating with

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:32,160
developers who are working on

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:35,600
code bases in the open from multiple

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,719
public organizations uh these code bases

00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,640
are under stewardship

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:43,200
of the foundation for public code

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,000
public code is free and open source

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,719
software

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,440
developed by public organizations or for

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,120
public

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:53,840
organizations to achieve

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,960
a public policy or part of a public

00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,239
policy

00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,600
and increasingly

00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,800
we find that policy is being implemented

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,199
in software

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,720
and that our core infrastructure is

00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,880
sometimes

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,840
at least having a software component if

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,600
not being entirely

00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,400
software and as people talk about the

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,560
so-called

00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,759
digital transformation of the public

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,799
sector it's a

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,119
thing i keep hearing people say we in

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,880
fact

00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:27,200
see this unfolding all the time and all

00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,200
public infrastructure whether that's a

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,159
bridge or whether it's software

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,439
tends to have very high expectations and

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,680
requirements

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,600
that things outside the public sector

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,920
don't necessarily have to have

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,399
specifically around transparency but

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,119
also reliability accountability

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,799
but even things like sovereignty is one

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,240
of the things that comes up

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,680
and this is a lot to ask of a small

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,720
public organization

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,240
a municipality that is of a small

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,520
village trying to

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,159
make sure that their their citizenry

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,920
can help participate in where the

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,320
potholes are the street lights that are

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,159
out

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,000
uh probably don't have their own i.t

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,120
staff and they don't have expertise

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,160
in this and their needs though are the

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,080
same as

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,680
the needs of other municipalities some

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,120
great some small

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,599
and the way we are achieving this today

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,800
to meet these expectations and fulfill

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,560
these requirements

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:30,720
is collaborating in the open across

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:33,760
organizations and a key tool to that

00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,599
is the standard for public code all of

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,800
the collaborators agree

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,519
to fulfill the requirements and and

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,640
uphold

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,720
all the criteria in the standard and if

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,920
you're a developer

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,360
as you look through this you're not

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,480
going to see anything that's very

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,800
surprising to you

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,640
it's almost certainly going to be things

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,840
that you're either already doing

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,120
or maybe you wish you were doing what's

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,560
going to be different

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,200
from maybe other agile handbooks

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,000
or engineering guides is that there's

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,200
guidance

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,319
for not just individual contributors

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,959
but also for management and even policy

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,280
makers

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,959
and what this means is that the devs the

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,879
designers the people that are

00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,080
contributing to the project know that

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,800
they have the support

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,319
of people at many layers in the

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,879
organization whether they are

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,440
a contracted uh developer working for a

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,760
vendor

00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,280
providing software services or whether

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,640
they are

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,920
a developer employed by the state

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,920
and so as they're collaborating

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:44,239
the public administrations are

00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,319
having the growing understanding that

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,480
the software that they're working on

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,599
is going to be evolving to fit their

00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,519
needs over time

00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:56,560
and they can collaborate on procuring

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,720
the next feature rather than

00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,400
trying to understand all of what their

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,400
possible needs are up front

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,000
that they can work incrementally which

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,840
is a very different model

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,040
than the way they've done procurement in

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,599
the past

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,720
but because they're using the standard

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,000
because they're collaborating with

00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,799
others using the standard they have

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,480
confidence

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,079
that these procurements are going to add

00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,479
up to giving them

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,120
that increased control the reduction in

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:22,079
risks

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,720
and costs and they'll see their tax

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,960
spend

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,759
be more effective because the sum is

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,160
adding up

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:33,840
to something greater than the parts so

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,360
if you are at all connected to

00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,440
any sort of software development in the

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,160
public sector or if you just have an

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,160
interest

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,199
i invite you to review the standard for

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,919
public code

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,360
and hopefully even participate it's

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,639
currently draft

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,600
and we are making this a public resource

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,800
as well

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,600
so there's the link to the

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,720
repository for it pull requests are

00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,479
absolutely welcome

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,479
and you can also get in touch with me

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,840
directly

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,600
