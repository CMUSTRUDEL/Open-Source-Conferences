Title: #FOSSBack: Eric Herman - How the Standard for Public Code can help you collaborate over time & space
Publication date: 2021-03-02
Playlist: FOSS Backstage 2021 #FOSSBack
Description: 
	Our goal is to help people developing public-purpose software understand how the Standard for Public Code can help them collaborate. The Standard is of course applicable to everyone developing open source software, and is especially useful if you want other organizations to be able to contribute to your code.

By applying the Standard, code created for and by governments will not only be reusable and open source on paper, but also in practice. We hope to show that it is not that hard to create genuinely reusable code, and inspire collaboration across public organizations.

The talk will also answer the following questions:

    What is public code?
    Why the need for a Standard for Public Code?

The talk will show how the Foundation for Public Code is already applying the Standard to some codebases, and how this has helped those communities.
