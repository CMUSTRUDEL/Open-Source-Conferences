	More: https://berlinbuzzwords.de/session/journey-write-new-lucene-postingsformat

Some hard technical challenges are better solved by changing the foundations. We had a use case of searching many fields with strong constraints on memory and performance. We needed a massive number of fields to support field level security at scale and open the path to machine learned ranking models.

A custom PostingsFormat allowed for a solution with greater efficiencies than our prior solution. We developed a new Lucene PostingsFormat called UniformSplit, we deployed it at a very large scale, and we open-sourced it. We learned a lot during the journey, especially about micro-benchmarking, java memory consumption, compact data representation and high performance Lucene indices.

This presentation is a good medium to share what we learned with step backwards, the learnings on the Lucene mechanisms, the tips and the pitfalls we encountered. And as we continued the development, we will share the latest works and production measures.

hello I am no stone search engineer has

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:19,050
set socks and listen Scirocco meter

00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:21,869
today I will talk about listen posting

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,119
format and the journey we had to write a

00:00:21,869 --> 00:00:27,179
new one

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:30,029
what is the posting format it's the

00:00:27,179 --> 00:00:33,840
structure and format of the listen

00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:38,100
inverted index it's a low-level code a

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:43,590
foundation why did we need a new posting

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:46,380
poet it's all about new challenges of a

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,560
massive number of field at scale so

00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:56,130
let's have an overview of our journey to

00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:59,640
solve them and share our experience here

00:00:56,130 --> 00:01:02,130
is the agenda on the left the agenda

00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,659
sections and on the right the journey

00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:10,799
map each agenda section corresponds to a

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:13,880
line in the map the white bullets on the

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:17,180
map represent challenges and solutions

00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:21,570
while the orange triangles represent

00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:24,360
issues and obstacles that's a big

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:28,229
journey filled with challenges issues

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:31,620
and solutions let's start by putting

00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:36,000
some contexts and by describing the

00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:38,940
challenges Salesforce search is a search

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,170
as a platform in a highly multi-tenant

00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:46,440
context at scale on the right we can

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:49,440
have an idea of the scale on top of that

00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:53,909
we want to search a massive number of

00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:58,890
fields up to 150 fields for nearly all

00:01:53,909 --> 00:02:02,850
queries why because the documents are

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:07,140
highly structured and diverse we enforce

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:09,509
dynamic field level security one user

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:14,159
may not be authorized to search all

00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:17,819
fields we also improve the relevancy by

00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:20,959
learning models which apply boosts per

00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:20,959
individual field

00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:29,750
so we have challenging constraints mm

00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:34,280
online charts pass or a node while

00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:36,920
searching more than 150 fields our first

00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:41,060
approach was obviously to use the

00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:44,210
standard listen index we benchmarked it

00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:49,310
with our production data shape and scale

00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:52,460
and as anticipated it failed the node

00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:55,820
went quickly out of memory with terrible

00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:57,220
research query throughput before

00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,650
explaining the details

00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:05,750
let's look directly at the journey

00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:08,000
outcome given the constraints we

00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:11,960
developed a new recent posting format

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,690
called uniform split it is designed to

00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:17,030
be simple and extensible the base

00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:20,290
version follows the posting format API

00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:23,870
and a regular field index approach and

00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:26,810
an extension called Shelton's makes it

00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:30,200
possible to store and access efficiently

00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:33,520
a massive number of fields we did a

00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:36,020
performance campaign we fixed issues and

00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:39,709
eventually the performance and memory

00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:42,230
are good except for spell check fuzzy

00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:47,840
queries we will explain that in a moment

00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:51,860
I would like to thank boss 1 Camilo

00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:57,590
Villegas do one and David smiley who

00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:59,780
contribute to this project now let's

00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:05,510
come back to the journey map to get more

00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:09,680
details so we have seen that we had very

00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:13,040
challenging constraint this is the first

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,400
line of the map then we started to

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,120
investigate solutions we needed a

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:25,700
solution to reduce memory usage and

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:28,669
increase query throughput our main

00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:31,130
challenge was to reduce memory usage not

00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:32,389
a small issue a serious out of memory

00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,909
break

00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:38,090
here is the structure of the Rossini

00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:41,180
inductive index on the left you can see

00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:44,810
the index layers and the order from top

00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:47,930
to bottom on the right the index

00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:51,949
structures corresponding to each index

00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:56,900
layer let's say we search the term big

00:04:51,949 --> 00:05:00,439
in the title field the recent index will

00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:05,419
get the title the term dictionary for

00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:09,620
the title field then it will seek the

00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:11,930
term big in the dictionary then

00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:16,990
depending on the query it will gather

00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:20,659
more data from the postings and payload

00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:22,819
such as the ideas of documents

00:05:20,659 --> 00:05:27,919
containing the term and the positions of

00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:31,340
the term in each document in our context

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:35,900
we had a big memory issue because we

00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:40,430
have 150 fields so 150 dictionary trees

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:43,729
in memory actually with loosing 8 the

00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:47,839
dictionary is now kept on disk and not

00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:50,330
in memory this is called FST of it even

00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:54,039
if this may not be a memory issue

00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:57,560
anymore it becomes a disk access issue

00:05:54,039 --> 00:06:01,930
because there are so many blocks to load

00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,930
for a single query with so many fields

00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:09,080
so to solve the memory and performance

00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:13,159
issues the idea is to swap the index

00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:17,330
layers between fields and terms and we

00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:20,960
are we are going to do that now here we

00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:23,990
swap on the Left the terms becomes the

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,439
first layer the fields becomes the

00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:32,029
second layer the field information is

00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:34,789
now stored per term in the index when we

00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:40,339
seek the term big we now look at the

00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:40,790
field information in the dictionary this

00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:44,060
has

00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:48,580
two advantages first we share the terms

00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:53,390
of all fields in the single prefix tree

00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:58,430
this is very compact compared to the 150

00:06:53,390 --> 00:07:00,980
prefix trees we had before second our

00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:05,510
use case is to search the same query in

00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:10,010
all 150 fields this is a recent

00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:12,410
disjunction max query in our example we

00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:17,000
searched the term B in three fields

00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:19,430
title auto and body so now it becomes

00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:23,330
possible to seek only ones the term

00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:26,630
perfect tree we search once but we can

00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:30,050
cache the datums data for all fields and

00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:37,340
serve it for all of our field doing only

00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:40,880
one index Ruka so we have the solution

00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:45,020
to swap the fields and terms layers to

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:47,240
share terms between field but actually

00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:52,070
there are various ways to implement that

00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:55,280
we explore them we implemented initially

00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:59,960
a virtual fields layer wrapping the rest

00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:04,430
in standard block tree it works but it's

00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:08,380
a trick with limitations we skipped

00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:11,480
other options we even missed one

00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:14,570
eventually we decided to design a new

00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:17,620
posting format not only a specific to us

00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:24,830
key to our use case but that could be

00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:27,290
shared to the community so we were going

00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:30,620
to design a new posting format this is a

00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:34,750
complex work we had to have clear goals

00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:37,790
and focus on them and we knew we had to

00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:39,890
prepare to compromises because the

00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:43,070
existing standard posting format is

00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:45,470
highly optimized we took the opportunity

00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:51,400
of an internship to explore

00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:51,400
possibilities we brainstormed and

00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:59,500
coming back to the Johnny map we saw the

00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:03,730
challenges and the issues on memory and

00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:07,120
performances we saw the investigations

00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:09,430
and the Chatham's principle now we are

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,850
going to explore the recent posting

00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:18,910
format API before looking at the detail

00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:21,400
of the new posting format first what is

00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:25,000
the posting for that it's the way we

00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:27,220
store the investing index in listen we

00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,300
get the posting format from the codec

00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:34,690
the codec is composed of multiple parts

00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:38,170
of the listen index such as posting

00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:43,360
format but also dog values format stored

00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:48,910
field format and others we will focus on

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:52,950
the posting format API only the posting

00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:56,080
format API is layer 2 it provides both

00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:59,770
fields consumer to write the English

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:04,300
index and a field producer to read it

00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:07,510
and search it for a given field the

00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:11,230
fields producer provides terms instances

00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:17,020
which gives access to the terms in a

00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:21,100
given field field dictionary let's take

00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:24,460
an example if we search the term big in

00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:28,180
the field title we access the fields

00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:31,740
producer and we get the terms instance

00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:34,830
colors corresponding to the field title

00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:38,200
then each time we need to seek or

00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:44,590
iterate through the terms of the fields

00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:47,860
we create a stateful damson you tamson

00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:53,730
'm allows us to browse the index and see

00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:59,080
the term big we access the term prefix

00:10:53,730 --> 00:11:01,930
corresponding to the field then we go

00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:04,560
through the tree and we get the

00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:10,170
corresponding term block to

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:13,320
look for the search term from there we

00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:15,150
can further access the posting permit we

00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:19,730
access the document list position

00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:19,730
payloads depending on the query needs

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:27,900
coming back to our new posting format we

00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:29,210
want to swap the field inside the terms

00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:32,970
dictionary

00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:41,460
this will be the shared terms uniform

00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:44,250
speed extension actually we have to

00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:49,560
design a new posting format up to terms

00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:52,710
in the purple part here we can still

00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:55,950
reuse a big building block the postings

00:11:52,710 --> 00:12:00,589
annum which manages the postings and

00:11:55,950 --> 00:12:00,589
payloads this is the green part here

00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:09,080
okay we knew which API we had to

00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:16,200
implement next step was to think about

00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:19,740
the design of this new posting format so

00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:23,970
what is uniform split it's a technique

00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:27,540
to write the inverted index inductive

00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:34,020
index is composable of blocks of terms

00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:37,410
to split the search efficiently standard

00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:41,640
blocked rebuilds the blocks based on the

00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:44,040
common prefixes of the terms uniform

00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:48,060
split builds the blocks by targeting a

00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:54,540
uniform block size the number of terms

00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:57,150
in a block to access those blocks we map

00:12:54,540 --> 00:13:02,459
the blocks with an efficient and very

00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:06,060
compact data structure the listen FST we

00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:09,600
call block key the first term of each

00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:11,540
each block and we store the block keys

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:16,360
in the FST

00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:18,790
as we put uniformly the blocks

00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:27,040
get a minimal number of blocks so the

00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:30,250
FST size is minimized actually we don't

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:33,430
need the full term to distinguish a term

00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:36,029
from its previous we can take the

00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:40,600
minimal disk we distinguish in prefix

00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:44,529
MDP instead for the same functionality

00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:49,209
we can store block keys MDP instead of

00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:56,110
the full term this reduces the FST

00:13:49,209 --> 00:14:01,180
footprint however sometimes we can still

00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:03,790
have long block keys MDP so there is a

00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:07,440
good chance to find a smaller NDP within

00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:11,230
the neighborhoods here in the example

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:15,000
instead of taking five as the key of the

00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:19,420
third block we can select the term field

00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:24,190
just before because it's MDP is smaller

00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:27,850
f so we further optimize by selecting

00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:32,709
the local optimal block keys with the

00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:35,500
shortest MDP by looking at the FST on

00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:43,680
the left we can see it holds less and

00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:46,690
less data when we access a block we scan

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:49,630
sequentially the terms in the block this

00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:54,399
means we can encode incrementally the

00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:57,390
terms in the block on the right we see

00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:00,660
the incremental encoding of the terms

00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:03,880
this reduces the disk footprint and

00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:11,440
speeds up both the block loading and

00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:14,079
terms matching and last but not least we

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:17,079
start by first comparing with the middle

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:19,860
term in the block and we jump directly

00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:23,380
there if the term we look for is after

00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:26,589
this is like a first step of a binary

00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:28,720
search inside the block dividing by two

00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:31,319
the number of terms we have to scan

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,319
sequential

00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:41,500
so this is all the optimization for the

00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:45,820
uniform split principle at that point of

00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:49,330
the journey we had our goals and design

00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:55,510
defined we started to implement our new

00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:58,240
posting format we implemented a base

00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:02,230
version of uniform split with the

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,970
regular index layers ordering fills

00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:08,500
first and terms

00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:11,140
second this uniform split base was

00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:15,160
extensible so we could continue with an

00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:18,970
extension for the shuttle principal with

00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:26,770
the index layer swapped terms first and

00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:30,070
field second the extensibility allows

00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:36,160
other extensions not necessarily

00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:39,240
specific to our use case eventually we

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:42,670
implemented to posting formats one base

00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:46,210
for general purpose and low memory

00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:48,550
footprint and an extension to support

00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:55,530
efficiently a massive number of fields

00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:58,780
still extensible itself a world test

00:16:55,530 --> 00:17:01,030
what about test implementing to new

00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:05,260
posting format must require a huge

00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:07,569
testing effort actually no we didn't

00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:11,230
have to do much on this side hopefully

00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:14,650
we could leverage the awesome listen

00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:17,380
randomized test framework those tests

00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:21,670
are testing a lot of Corner K is an

00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:30,280
extreme usage and you can configure them

00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:32,770
to run your code good we had the two

00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:35,710
implementations well tested then of

00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:39,370
course we need we needed to benchmark

00:17:35,710 --> 00:17:42,520
the performance as we can see the

00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:45,900
performance was going to be a journey in

00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:49,650
we found multiple challenges to address

00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:51,480
let's see the difference between being

00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:54,330
functionally complete and

00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:57,820
production-ready

00:17:54,330 --> 00:18:01,630
the first version worked already seen

00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:08,290
test passed and the shared extension

00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:11,980
also worked we started to benchmark with

00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:13,960
a first micro benchmark in dude we

00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:17,620
didn't want to invest too much at this

00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:22,690
stage this benchmarking has limitation

00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:25,840
and it only guided us on some choices we

00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:28,600
confirmed them in the next stages we

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:31,660
focused our goals on some specific

00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:34,120
queries at this stage we didn't have the

00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:39,460
right data volume but the performance

00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:42,490
results were encouraging for the next

00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:45,700
stage we leveraged the listen until

00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:50,710
benchmarking commonly used in the scene

00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:53,410
to compare codecs it when it benchmarks

00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:58,600
a wide variety of queries for values

00:18:53,410 --> 00:19:01,390
index Isis and actually we immediately

00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:04,540
discovered that the short-term extension

00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:07,930
had serious performance issues when

00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:12,490
building index when merging the index

00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:18,720
Iran segment so we customized the merge

00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:18,720
method and the performance when good

00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:27,760
running multiple benchmark we found also

00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:32,840
problems with the memory allocation and

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:35,120
garbage garbage collection time we had

00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:39,710
to review the object allocations and

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:43,570
reuse we changed some objects to become

00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:46,910
mutable we also reviewed the lambda and

00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:51,520
Java stream code that can lead to

00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:55,600
unanticipated object allocations and

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,600
finally GC went good

00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:02,780
finally we could compare uniform split

00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:07,190
with the recent standard block tree post

00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:09,950
in fact the speed for many term or

00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:11,080
phrase queries was good for uniform

00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:15,170
split

00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:17,360
notice how the index size impacts the

00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:22,310
relative importance of the posting

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:25,160
format in the lookup speed but with this

00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:28,310
benchmark we discovered we add a serious

00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:32,980
performance issues with the spell check

00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:37,130
or further queries we investigate we

00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:40,250
investigated way actually

00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:44,030
the investigation and fixes spanned over

00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:46,760
several Maltese we customized the term

00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:50,000
intersect method which is called by

00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:53,770
queries such as prefix wildcard spell

00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,630
check fuzzy queries after two

00:20:53,770 --> 00:21:00,410
unsatisfying attempts the third one gave

00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:05,810
nice improvement available now since

00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:07,250
recent 8.5 however it's still below blog

00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:12,160
3 for fuzzy queries

00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:12,160
this is a compromise we had to make

00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:18,650
resonated benchmarks a wide variety of

00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:22,640
queries but it doesn't measure memory

00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:28,060
GC or disk the last step was to go to

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:28,060
shadow experiments and real productions

00:21:30,509 --> 00:21:36,759
the final version of uniform split in

00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:41,380
projection includes an additional cash

00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:45,000
at posting format level driven by query

00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:50,289
hints it is adapted to our use case

00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:53,769
queries and data shape when we compared

00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:56,409
the performance in production we could

00:21:53,769 --> 00:22:01,320
see impressive gains compared to the

00:21:56,409 --> 00:22:05,679
standard individual field approach and

00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:07,450
we could see significant gain compared

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:11,049
to the virtual field layer

00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:20,769
approach including a very important

00:22:11,049 --> 00:22:24,460
saving on garbage collection activity as

00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:30,190
a conclusion what did we learn from this

00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:33,490
journey what was the outcome about

00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:36,429
posting formats we learned a lot first

00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:39,539
they are also a posting format not only

00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:43,899
the standard block tree they are all

00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:46,919
with dedicated use case there is a

00:22:43,899 --> 00:22:49,690
perfect posting format to combine them

00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:52,559
second you don't have to write

00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:56,789
everything from scratch there are many

00:22:52,559 --> 00:23:01,750
existing components to reuse the other

00:22:56,789 --> 00:23:04,899
the recent test routes are extensive the

00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:08,519
test if what is actually light and there

00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:13,059
is also the reason until benchmarking

00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:19,600
finally it's good to discuss early with

00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:21,850
the community to get feedback so there

00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,419
is a new posting format called uniform

00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:29,220
split it's a good candidate for

00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:32,529
extension and customization it has a

00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:37,990
short-term extension to support massive

00:23:32,529 --> 00:23:41,200
number of fields efficiently uniform

00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:43,310
split is efficient for most queries less

00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:47,100
for

00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:49,890
we combined boss uniform split and

00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:54,980
Brooktree with a per field botany

00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:54,980
posting format - under fuzzy queries

00:23:56,510 --> 00:24:00,620
that's it thank you

00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,870
