Thank You charlie and we're welcome

00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:18,119
thank you everybody for joining

00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:20,730
joining this talk last work at as a

00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,759
software engineer at way comp in the

00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,220
Netherlands and last year we did a

00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:29,310
project around the field searches and I

00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:31,950
thought it would be nice to share the

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,720
results we got so what's the way camp

00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:37,260
they compass a Dutch online e-commerce

00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:39,210
store we have a lot of customers a lot

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,640
of visitors we ship a lot of packages

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,649
per year then we also have a lot of

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:48,510
different products and a lot of

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:50,460
different brands so as any e-commerce

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,190
store we have a website where you can

00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,810
search for items in the search bar but

00:00:53,190 --> 00:01:01,350
sometimes you end up with no results and

00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:04,019
the this was how last year was our

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:05,759
search results failed search results

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,579
page and this is what we call a field

00:01:05,759 --> 00:01:13,590
search when there are no search results

00:01:08,579 --> 00:01:16,380
and if you can see it's quite boring

00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:18,390
it's empty and unfortunately a lot of

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:21,900
customers also ended their journey here

00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:24,150
so we wanted to improve upon that so how

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,240
did we approach it

00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,790
well first we sat down and looked okay

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:37,170
what could be the reason that customers

00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:38,400
end up on this on this page so for

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,130
instance could be that we don't have the

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,450
product or the brand and could be that

00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,430
we have the product but we cannot find

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,700
it or the product is sold out or it's

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,840
not released yet like the newest iPhone

00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:52,830
people are already searching for it but

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:59,010
nobody has it in stock yet we saw that

00:01:52,830 --> 00:02:00,299
the most reason most common reason was

00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:02,400
that we don't have the product or the

00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:04,500
brand and after that we have the product

00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:08,909
but you cannot find it so this was the

00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:10,110
main focus of our project and we tackle

00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:11,870
this project from two different size

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:16,500
improving the search and improving the

00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:20,069
field search page so here on the Left

00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:26,099
this you can see improving the search

00:02:20,069 --> 00:02:27,330
part and this is mainly to make learn to

00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:31,260
lower the chance that you

00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:34,430
end up on this field search page so this

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:36,150
is basically relevance engineering and

00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:40,410
that's what we did

00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:43,230
so this is an example of something that

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,910
we could improve in this way people are

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,910
looking for laptop who's who says the

00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,990
Dutch word for sleeve unfortunately we

00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,760
have them in the system as a laptop

00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:54,390
sleeve so this is something we can

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:57,060
improve well there are a lot of moving

00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:59,610
parts in in the search query before you

00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,380
get to the search results and there's a

00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,620
stemmer that's a de compound or there's

00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:06,450
we have synonyms we are indexing

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,180
products we have an intensity

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:13,290
recognition we have redirects in place

00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:16,350
to certain pages and so where to start

00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:20,220
what we did was we took the top thousand

00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:22,590
of field searches of the land of the

00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,020
previous three months and set down with

00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,270
the content team and really went line by

00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,820
line so okay what is the reason that

00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:34,140
this turned up - we have no search

00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:36,420
results and basically be improved in

00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:42,780
this way all of these different moving

00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:44,640
parts a little bit and but then you can

00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,420
still of course still end up on the

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,970
field search page so what we did there

00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:52,680
was ok can we find ways to increase the

00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:58,440
conversion in the sessions with the

00:03:52,680 --> 00:04:01,530
field search so this is how it was I'm

00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:05,430
looking for daily paper and I'm having

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:10,380
an empty search page and but now we have

00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:15,480
an following that's here it goes ok so I

00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:18,600
look for something this is a bearish and

00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:20,790
so at least this is already improved we

00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,880
still say sorry we cannot find what you

00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:26,160
were looking for but we now show at

00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:31,229
least a recommender so this is the last

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:34,650
few the last few items and we also added

00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:39,750
some links to the categories but for

00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:40,800
certain search phrases we around 30% I

00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,960
believe

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,830
we can improve so we had the previous

00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,629
example of Bailey paper this is a

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:52,710
popular brand but unfortunately we don't

00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:55,860
sell it but thankfully we have customers

00:04:52,710 --> 00:05:01,110
that were not satisfied with no as an

00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:02,520
answer and we sat down together with

00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:04,650
data science and they came up with an

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,259
alternative search phrase recommender so

00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:09,750
that's what you can see here so these

00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:12,330
are enough customers while we're looking

00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:16,740
for daily paper ended up also searching

00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:18,629
for something else then this will be

00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:22,530
added to the alternative search phrases

00:05:18,629 --> 00:05:26,219
and similarly we have alternatives

00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:28,409
search results so this is also

00:05:26,219 --> 00:05:33,210
recommended based on daily paper

00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:36,000
so maybe customers that were searching

00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:39,690
for daily paper ended up buying these

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,300
products and if enough customers do that

00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:44,699
then apparently there's a link between

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:49,080
this daily paper brands which we don't

00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:50,969
have and these items and you can see you

00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,090
can give some examples that it works

00:05:50,969 --> 00:06:00,680
pretty well Francis the be nosy is a

00:05:54,090 --> 00:06:06,949
brand of colorful children's clothes and

00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:12,349
this brand we don't have but we do sell

00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:19,909
colorful children's clothes so this is

00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:23,520
pretty nice some more examples rain cape

00:06:19,909 --> 00:06:26,150
we don't have that we have done but we

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,490
have them as rain poncho or rain jacket

00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:32,550
so I think our customer will be

00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:38,270
satisfied for ending up with this field

00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:42,659
search page and another example could be

00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:44,940
epic socks it's also a brand this time

00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:47,759
of colorful socks we also don't have

00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:51,139
that but we do have colorful socks and

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,139
then we share these

00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:59,400
so this is what I wanted to tell you if

00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:00,840
I show you and if you want to know more

00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,760
about maybe a little bit about the

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,960
algorithms feel free to ask me in the

00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:11,960
chat or later in the social and but for

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,960
now please stay safe and thank you

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,820
fantastic thank you very much purpose do

00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:20,850
we have any questions I'm just going to

00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:23,940
hop into the history now oh here we go

00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:25,770
yes we have a question from Andrew how

00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:33,690
do you know what's related to the brand

00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:37,400
that you do not sell well for instance

00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:40,050
that that the daily paper one there's

00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,880
other customers that also were searching

00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:46,260
for daily paper but they ended up

00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:48,810
searching for other things too a brand

00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:51,330
that also sells hoodies and if you know

00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:54,930
if a customer's do that then you and

00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:59,910
then you did and ends up as a

00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:01,550
recommendation so in that way we we are

00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:05,000
confident that there's a link between

00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:07,440
those big brand and those search phrases

00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,220
so you're crowdsourcing as links

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,720
effectively between the brain yes yeah

00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:14,400
fantastic thank you do we have any other

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,510
questions for Philippa sir shall we move

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:19,470
on I don't see anything in the slack and

00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:27,030
that's you're going to type nice and

00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:29,070
quickly well that's great I do

00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:31,430
appreciate this problem I once saw a

00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:33,900
client of ours several years ago about

00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:36,599
30% of their searches going to a no

00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:38,910
results page and you think in that

00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,560
situation you worry if you wonder if

00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:43,979
they just like burning money Frankie

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,020
exactly thank you so much for your talk

00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:47,340
and first for stepping in we do

00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:50,150
appreciate people who volunteer the

00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:50,150
lightning talk so
