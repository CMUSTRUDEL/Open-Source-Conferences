Imagine a shopper searches for "coffee". The search results mindlessly repeat brand name, ground coffee over and over. Technically relevant. But not very useful. Not mixed in are results appealing to a different kind of "coffee" searcher:  organic coffee, whole bean, espresso, or related coffee equipment. 

Beyond relevant results is Result Set Diversity: providing not just technically correct answers, but a diverse (though still relevant) view of what's possible in the search system. Showing our grocery searcher that we might, after all, have something they want.

In this panel, we'll discuss Result Set Diversity in search. We'll hear from teams working to summarize for users the diverse array of options available to them given their query. An ideal search experience helps provide next steps, broaden the user's understanding of the content related to keywords, and cover the user's possible, unspoken intent.

Join host Doug Turnbull and search practitioners, Andreas Wagner, Felipe Besson, and Lev Gershenzon, as we hear experiences measuring & solving Results Diversity, with a panel discussion on the Result Search Diversity problem.

	00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:14,410
as I'm the first one in this barrel it

00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:14,410
will be an introduction

00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:23,590
talk and yeah well first of all a couple

00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,840
of words about myself and our company we

00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:28,779
are doing Product Search Search

00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:31,210
recommendations and catalog navigation

00:00:28,779 --> 00:00:34,900
solutions so as you can see we're quite

00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:38,879
a small company but still have a

00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:41,920
significant amount of queries in

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:45,340
different domains and so this diversity

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:49,899
issue is a challenge they have to take

00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:53,770
on so well I must confess that in my

00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:58,960
talk there will be more questions than

00:00:53,770 --> 00:01:03,640
answers but this is a list of questions

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:10,450
the positions I I'd like to to touch and

00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:14,619
a bit to talk about and we'll start with

00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:19,179
the air with the question what's what's

00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:21,069
actually the problem and yeah with the

00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:24,580
diversity so well if we consider

00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:29,310
ourselves or our search engine as this

00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:32,530
dog so this is a simple situation where

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:36,039
obviously I know the list is needed so

00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:38,580
we see how user the task is clear just

00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:43,240
go and fetch what you've been asked on

00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:47,950
but more often the situation can be like

00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:52,030
this then we should retrieve at least

00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:56,110
two sticks in different colors or even

00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:58,509
like this when not just well a number of

00:01:56,110 --> 00:02:01,209
different sticks I need it but maybe you

00:01:58,509 --> 00:02:05,770
can see a tennis ball can also be useful

00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:10,630
and sometimes when a query is brought we

00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:13,239
can you can retrieve like a huge pile of

00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:16,540
totally different different products and

00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:19,510
the question will try to answer or at

00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:23,739
least approach to is how to organize

00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:27,620
this pile and how to make it useful for

00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:31,190
our users so the first question is

00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:38,260
we are actually what are the sources of

00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:40,190
the of diversity so yeah and there are

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:44,150
three main sources

00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:49,459
the first one is ambiguity and with the

00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:52,250
situation where same words can just be a

00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:56,840
different meanings and the question we

00:02:52,250 --> 00:03:02,390
have to ask is what what object was was

00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:04,549
meant when user typed in this query the

00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:07,579
second the second source is in

00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:10,220
incompleteness so well sometimes we can

00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:13,609
understand what what object is being

00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:15,590
meant but there are too many various

00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:19,129
types of objects for example if we are

00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:21,650
talking about coffee machine were vacuum

00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:25,700
cleaners there are different sorts of

00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:27,590
them and we may be not quite sure what

00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:32,690
what exactly kind of product the user

00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:34,430
meant and the another type of this and

00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:37,819
completeness may be that even if we

00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:41,180
understand quite clearly what object was

00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:45,489
meant we may be not sure about the

00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:45,489
intent so what about this object is

00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:54,859
interested it is interesting for for

00:03:48,889 --> 00:03:57,290
users and of course we have different

00:03:54,859 --> 00:04:01,849
people different users they may mean

00:03:57,290 --> 00:04:05,319
different things and even one person the

00:04:01,849 --> 00:04:09,019
same person we mean and were at

00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:11,329
different tasks using the same words so

00:04:09,019 --> 00:04:18,979
let's have a look at a Google search

00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:20,810
page for a broad query the Lima we can

00:04:18,979 --> 00:04:25,430
see here yeah we know that this this

00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:28,490
word can be can mean a donut it also can

00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:32,570
describe a resident of Berlin or also in

00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:35,270
German it can be an adjective referring

00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:40,219
to the city of bullet and as we can see

00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:42,660
on this page we have this three meanings

00:04:40,219 --> 00:04:48,120
represent

00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:53,199
doughnuts doughnuts we have even to

00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:57,009
Wikipedia definitions we have two

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,960
sections about Berlin and one is the new

00:04:57,009 --> 00:05:02,310
section and another is it risk

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,900
information and also one example

00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:08,370
referring to the president of book and

00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:11,379
in terms of intense we can see a

00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:14,349
dictionary definition new section

00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:16,840
recipes images

00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:18,970
yeah the statistic information queries

00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:23,110
and answers

00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:26,139
so quite quite wide range of different

00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:28,419
intents is coming on or only on this one

00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:31,599
page and yeah another thing is that

00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:35,440
Google isn't it isn't quite sure in what

00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:37,780
language you engage with me so we can

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:42,550
see the results both in English and

00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:47,520
German but let's have a look at some

00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:51,580
examples in e-commerce and we choose for

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:55,330
ya like our following users journey and

00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:58,210
teachers marketplace it's called Larimar

00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:00,940
plots it's the marketplace where

00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:03,370
teachers can sell the materials for

00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:06,340
others teach for other teachers to buy

00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:08,860
them and to use them in class yeah that

00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:12,190
can help conducting their lessons so

00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:15,130
let's have a look and let's try to find

00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:20,259
out what one single word one query like

00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:25,810
faster water may mean first of all we'll

00:06:20,259 --> 00:06:30,610
try to see what other queries containing

00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:33,699
this word are in our log yeah well on

00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:37,900
this this light we can just notice that

00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:40,690
it's a really huge really long tail but

00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:43,599
we were interested in define were in

00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:47,889
finding out the meaning or the meanings

00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:50,830
and in terms of this first query so if

00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:53,319
we have a look on the top most frequent

00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:59,949
queries containing this word

00:06:53,319 --> 00:07:03,979
it can identify at least four different

00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:05,960
objects for different meanings for

00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:08,690
different objects that are of interest

00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:11,449
to users maybe for different users the

00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:14,979
like what a cycle physical states of

00:07:11,449 --> 00:07:18,710
weather water colors and something

00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:23,630
having to do with saving water were

00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:26,680
using water yeah and but when we think

00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:32,599
about maintaining or automatically

00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:35,360
identifying these objects we may take

00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:38,150
into consideration that they Iraq a lot

00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,389
of formally different ways of expressing

00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:43,159
once a median so these are some examples

00:07:41,389 --> 00:07:45,050
for the physical states of water

00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:47,690
enjoyment

00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:51,349
another question we're talking about is

00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:53,509
about intent or in this case type of

00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:56,199
material because well for different

00:07:53,509 --> 00:07:59,810
lessons for different teachers may be

00:07:56,199 --> 00:08:02,690
different types valuable and we can see

00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:05,900
even in the top lists mentions of

00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:10,039
experiments or some researchers books

00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:13,490
and this types of materials can also be

00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:17,840
found in the filters section we'll talk

00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:20,840
about about it a bit more later and

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,090
there are some some other important for

00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:28,099
making a choice parameters that are also

00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:30,949
can be expressed explicitly expressed in

00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:33,110
in this query so this is about the type

00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:37,849
of schools like primary schools grades

00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:43,599
and water were as a null Jean in some

00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:43,599
other domains like grant can also be

00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:52,670
directly demanded in in the queries by

00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:56,740
the users so we just had a quick look on

00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:59,470
the text of queries that we and

00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:02,690
simplifying the situation consider as

00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:06,140
formulations and this source of

00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,800
information about where we can find some

00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:11,390
perfect

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:15,950
patience for the meaning of the words it

00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:20,870
corresponds to the query box and query

00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:24,050
suggestions section section but it's his

00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:28,790
source it's it's a tool that users use

00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:30,740
when they are somehow very disconnected

00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:36,019
and satisfied with the results and they

00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:38,120
just decide to reformulate to ask

00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:42,290
another question another source is

00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:45,290
filters I would describe the situation a

00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:48,320
bit different when the user when users

00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:51,200
are somehow satisfied with the results

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:55,519
but they have they see too many noise

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:58,250
and they just simply by clicking on some

00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:03,800
facets of filters want to refine the

00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:06,980
results but the most may be valuable or

00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:09,440
and even very difficult source of

00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,750
information is just the dispersive

00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,790
interactions or so called passive

00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:16,520
interactions of users with search

00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:18,680
results like quick said to cards and

00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:22,190
purchases and of course every a commerce

00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:25,370
project aims to increase the purchases

00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:29,140
and purchase or transaction is some sign

00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:33,260
of a successful session but well know

00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:38,209
some problems with the source like this

00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:42,260
data is very biased by the current

00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:47,360
search engine and it's maybe sometimes

00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:50,390
hard to properly norwich these three

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,480
types of interaction interactions but

00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:57,440
still we can't miss it because well it

00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:02,440
adds a lot to just looking at the text

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:07,579
of the queries and we can see here some

00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:10,190
distributions of most important for

00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:12,529
making a choice in this domain and

00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:15,740
characters so here are some subjects

00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:19,310
tags and also material types and waters

00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,680
and what if we had a bit more time what

00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:23,920
we could notice that

00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:27,069
this lists the stop lists of parental

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,550
values different here in the search

00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:32,949
results distributions from the list that

00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:37,959
we saw analyzing the text of the queries

00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:42,100
the reformulations and there's no

00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:45,429
surprising here because well as we

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:52,470
already mentioned the nature of this

00:11:45,429 --> 00:11:55,749
data is is is different but now if we

00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:58,389
phrase this complicated task to merge

00:11:55,749 --> 00:12:01,089
the information about the possible

00:11:58,389 --> 00:12:05,170
meanings or intents from all the

00:12:01,089 --> 00:12:09,519
available sources sources we may have a

00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:12,899
kind of profile with the weights or

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:17,709
maybe even probabilities for a

00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:20,800
successful for immediate result document

00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:28,050
to have this this values or this

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:32,829
properties and yeah let's now try to

00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:37,839
compare two search result pages in terms

00:12:32,829 --> 00:12:40,569
of diversity and also relevance what we

00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:47,170
can see here that the search result on

00:12:40,569 --> 00:12:49,329
the right is nearly 20 times as 20 times

00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:52,269
more results oh well we could we could

00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:54,269
assume that the recall of the right

00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:58,209
search result page is 20 times better

00:12:54,269 --> 00:13:00,790
but if we remember some some values that

00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:04,170
we saw on previous slides we can see

00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:06,730
that we can notice here different

00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:09,100
authors on the left that we already

00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:13,629
mentioned and so on our distributions

00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:17,649
that the subjects on top of the left

00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:20,860
section corresponds to the list of off

00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:24,670
school subject so there and on the right

00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:30,249
we have four out of six results from one

00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:33,639
author or one publishing house and yes

00:13:30,249 --> 00:13:34,360
oh well we can say that the left pages

00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:38,470
is more

00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:42,940
diversified than the right one and the

00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:46,420
performance some conversions also

00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:49,750
happened to be better with the left page

00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:53,019
so after this

00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:56,490
well example let's try to propose a goal

00:13:53,019 --> 00:14:02,220
setting for diversifying search results

00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:08,279
this is my proposal and I highlighted

00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:13,269
that in in my opinion the goal is to

00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:16,120
yeah to focus on users and taking

00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:18,940
accounts they interests it's about

00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:23,410
understanding them and it's also

00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:25,750
important not just to aim to on their

00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:27,370
own the first result page to provide the

00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:30,839
users with their desired products it

00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:33,850
would be perfect but at least to show

00:14:30,839 --> 00:14:36,730
something that looks like what they

00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:40,930
wanted to find and to purchase for

00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:45,820
example and now well having this in mind

00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:46,750
I'll look at some of the of these

00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:50,709
opposition's

00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:53,140
and try to yeah say couple of words

00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:55,690
about them if they're if they're real

00:14:53,140 --> 00:15:00,959
conflict here or not so well speaking

00:14:55,690 --> 00:15:02,920
about this diversity versus relevance we

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:06,930
shouldn't mean that relevance is

00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:09,820
important relevance is necessary but

00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:13,690
relevance is also maybe an ambiguous

00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:16,690
word because well we were notion we can

00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:20,260
talk about relevance in terms of words

00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:23,500
and text relevance warrant if we are

00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:28,170
lucky to be able to deconstruct the

00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:32,680
users tasks the relevance to this

00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:35,500
precise task may be even more important

00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:38,079
and there may be such situations when in

00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:41,649
terms of text relevance less relevant

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:47,560
results can be more relevant or more

00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:50,770
useful to solve this user test

00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:54,120
another connected the previous one

00:15:50,770 --> 00:16:00,550
opposition is between these two

00:15:54,120 --> 00:16:04,930
strategies like do we as a search engine

00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:09,790
have to only exploit to provide what we

00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:15,600
asked to or can we instead or maybe not

00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:19,540
instead understand the real task and to

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:23,560
make some recommendations maybe to

00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:24,640
provide some results that can be also

00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,830
useful

00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,420
additionally useful some some some

00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:33,640
additional results to what user

00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:37,090
explicitly asked for or maybe can we

00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:42,310
even suggest that there are some better

00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:45,550
results some results that may be even

00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:48,520
more useful more important for users of

00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:53,470
course this second strategy looks more

00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:57,970
dangerous but we believe that some

00:16:53,470 --> 00:17:00,360
combination whereas also possible there

00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:04,000
is a threat that adding personalization

00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:08,230
can lead to less diversity in search

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,600
results maybe everyone among us at this

00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:13,990
bad experience with personalization when

00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:16,810
we once bought something or even just

00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:19,839
click on some product and then being

00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:23,410
chased turn earlier with these products

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:27,900
on different sides and so on but from

00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:32,260
our perspective it's only a question of

00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:36,030
implementation because as more

00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:39,060
information as we can get about the user

00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:43,300
we should get and we should use it to

00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:46,510
make these results that we are offering

00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:48,400
him more vailable for him well in our

00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:52,410
terms in our example with the teachers

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:55,660
if we know for example that teacher is a

00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:59,230
chemistry teacher and

00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:02,280
she works in the primary school we can

00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:05,020
illuminate or we can show more results

00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:11,440
corresponding to these parameters but

00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:15,310
still since we can't be 100% sure that

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,410
we know everything about the user there

00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:21,630
is still space and should be left and

00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:24,490
space for diversity and for some other

00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:29,280
intense means or possible information

00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:32,860
about the user well this is a really

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:35,290
hard question I have no direct answers

00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:39,280
with how to measure diversity but we can

00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:43,000
also consider a number of variants

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:48,190
number of ways first of all taking well

00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:51,760
our goal setting I think it's useful

00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:55,030
it's worth considering this first result

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:58,360
page is a one-hole product and try to

00:18:55,030 --> 00:19:02,770
measure or to assess it and to judge it

00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:09,910
like one message one answer to the user

00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:13,030
and if we do this we can see that maybe

00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:16,120
the diversity measurement is something

00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:19,840
similar to a recall if we have if we

00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:22,750
define already one dimension or maybe

00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:29,700
some dimensions like the focus the

00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:33,130
object or intense we can measure how

00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:36,850
many or in what percentage the possible

00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:40,870
intents have been covered by this first

00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:43,240
result page yeah we only should should

00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:46,690
admit that this is much more difficult

00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:49,840
for with human judgments because well if

00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:57,220
we have one intent it's much easier for

00:19:49,840 --> 00:20:01,230
a mm Assessor for a writer to understand

00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:03,610
its intention to assess the results but

00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:07,810
it's really difficult or maybe even

00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:09,500
impossible to get this impression of all

00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:12,770
possible and intense

00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:17,870
- somehow weighed them yeah I have five

00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:22,370
minutes left and I'll I'll try I'll try

00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:26,809
to be a little more faster yeah well the

00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:30,260
last were almost last scene is about

00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:35,150
user interface I'm not an expert at all

00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:38,780
in this area but from the developers

00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:42,350
side I would demand I would be happy if

00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:46,120
user interface could help solve this

00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:49,700
same task like if we already have a

00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:54,110
really good relevant diversified search

00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:56,330
result page it's worth our user

00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:58,370
interface should help us or help users

00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:00,640
to solve two main tasks first of all

00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:03,860
quite quickly understand we are

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:09,159
potentially relevant results is of your

00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:11,480
tasks and secondly for some similar

00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:15,470
results to highlight the differences

00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:17,659
because that's also important for making

00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:21,730
a choice even where to click

00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:28,340
now all just just a couple of examples

00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:30,710
it's not to shame or to blame just to to

00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:33,280
mark that the the problem we are trying

00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:38,299
to solve is really existing and maybe

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:41,240
yeah quite relevant and timely so well

00:21:38,299 --> 00:21:43,039
this is an example set set aside yeah

00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,990
the relevance of the results for a

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:52,750
vacuum cleaner we can see - almost

00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:57,650
similar or identical results and it's

00:21:52,750 --> 00:22:01,010
yeah it's a problem to choose well

00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:04,039
another example with iPhones we can

00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:06,020
understand that the iPhone 7 on the left

00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:09,200
is quite a popular and a good match for

00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:14,840
many users but what's the difference in

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:18,049
in in this to precise variants and is it

00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:21,440
worth like Dublin repeating the whole

00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:22,420
information when it's only about the

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,020
difference

00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:33,510
in the color maybe the last the last

00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:36,100
example and it touches quite briefly

00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:37,660
this conflict between its possible

00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:40,510
contribution users interests and

00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:42,970
retailers interest and undress we'll

00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:46,120
talk more about it in detail hopefully

00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:49,210
but what I want to say I as a user can

00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:52,840
get the message that Amazon delivered

00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:57,240
for me that Amazon really wants that I

00:22:52,840 --> 00:23:00,040
bought this first item this first model

00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:02,940
but I don't think and I hope you'll

00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:05,040
agree with me that it's not a good idea

00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:07,750
it's not a good idea

00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,820
something that's important to you to

00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:12,730
just repeat twice maybe there are some

00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:15,970
other ways to bring deliver this

00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:18,070
information and so well the last slide

00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:22,270
what I want to say that from our

00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:25,330
perspective search diversity is about

00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:28,540
understanding is about better

00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:30,460
communication it's about taking into

00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:33,970
account minority interests and the

00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:38,500
tricky thing here and an interesting

00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:40,420
test is how not to damage the majorities

00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:44,410
were not to significantly damage the

00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:46,870
majorities user experience while taking

00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:50,110
an account this minorities interests

00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:56,499
thank you thank you very much

00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:59,570
oh now like what

00:23:56,499 --> 00:24:02,090
appreciate it so that was a great talk

00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:06,559
and lift thanks for framing the problem

00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:08,119
for us and I think you know the r32 one

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:09,440
thing I want to point out as are the

00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:12,259
three talks are from the e-commerce

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,090
domain but one thing I want to point out

00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:16,220
is I think this is a problem regardless

00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:17,899
of the specific domain it's a problem

00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,440
and research getting different points of

00:24:17,899 --> 00:24:23,090
view

00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:27,019
I mentioned job search before the users

00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:28,940
are increasingly less expressive

00:24:27,019 --> 00:24:31,279
sometimes you know it's interesting we

00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:33,799
are both solving for very expressive

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:36,739
queries with things involving natural

00:24:33,799 --> 00:24:39,769
language using Bert and that kind of

00:24:36,739 --> 00:24:41,659
thing but also users are extremely

00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:45,889
unexpressive and sometimes I think

00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:48,049
searches playing chess with with lazy

00:24:45,889 --> 00:24:50,779
users it's like your intelligence is
