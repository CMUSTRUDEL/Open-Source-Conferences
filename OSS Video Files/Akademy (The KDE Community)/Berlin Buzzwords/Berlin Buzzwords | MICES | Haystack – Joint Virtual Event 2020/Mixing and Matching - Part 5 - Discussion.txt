Title: Mixing and Matching - Part 5 - Discussion
Publication date: 2020-07-02
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords | MICES | Haystack â€“ Joint Virtual Event 2020
Description: 
	More: https://berlinbuzzwords.de/session/mixing-and-matching-diversifying-search-results

Imagine a shopper searches for "coffee". The search results mindlessly repeat brand name, ground coffee over and over. Technically relevant. But not very useful. Not mixed in are results appealing to a different kind of "coffee" searcher:  organic coffee, whole bean, espresso, or related coffee equipment. 

Beyond relevant results is Result Set Diversity: providing not just technically correct answers, but a diverse (though still relevant) view of what's possible in the search system. Showing our grocery searcher that we might, after all, have something they want.

In this panel, we'll discuss Result Set Diversity in search. We'll hear from teams working to summarize for users the diverse array of options available to them given their query. An ideal search experience helps provide next steps, broaden the user's understanding of the content related to keywords, and cover the user's possible, unspoken intent.

Join host Doug Turnbull and search practitioners, Andreas Wagner, Felipe Besson, and Lev Gershenzon, as we hear experiences measuring & solving Results Diversity, with a panel discussion on the Result Search Diversity problem.

so I know we have a lot of questions

00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:15,430
from the slide channel

00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:19,090
thought though as I went to gather those

00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:22,180
a bit more and sort of figure out how we

00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:25,000
might present them what I want to start

00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:27,540
with just one sort of topic which sticks

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,580
out to me when I when I see your

00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:36,550
presentations is what after we talk

00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:39,580
about this topic of diversification what

00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:42,400
finally do we think relevance means and

00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:44,730
is relevant something that's at odds

00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,420
with diversification of search results

00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:51,820
is it the foundation for it

00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:56,440
should we completely throw out our DCG

00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:58,720
and NDC geometrics and just focus more

00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,479
on random search results like I'd be

00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,040
curious what you guys think and I'll

00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,379
live why don't you kick us off just sort

00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,810
of with your thoughts on that

00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:11,979
uh well thank you yeah well I I think

00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:15,960
that relevance is a technical term

00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:21,759
actually when when we see well I always

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:25,600
try and recommend to see a user in front

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:28,570
of you so nobody is interested in in

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:32,049
having a lot of highlighted words in the

00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:35,020
title of the product they need something

00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:37,719
something else so if we can switch from

00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:40,659
talking about relevance to talking about

00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:43,719
the probability of this precise article

00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:50,829
to be useful word to be bought by this

00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:53,609
precise this precise user it can be more

00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:55,990
more fruitful and more useful of course

00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:58,749
relevance and the text relevance it's

00:01:55,990 --> 00:02:02,140
it's just a simple approximation to that

00:01:58,749 --> 00:02:05,409
so well in many in many cases the more

00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:09,280
words and the movers and the title we

00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:12,040
meet from the user query the the more

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:17,170
the closer connection to what he meant

00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:19,870
there is but it's it's not it's not the

00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:26,030
primary source and what we get from the

00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:28,520
data from all the slopes may be much

00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:34,510
precious because well this users lakhs

00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:36,740
is just recorded journeys and recorded

00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:38,630
attempts of overcoming this

00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:42,410
unsatisfaction and these difficulties

00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:47,150
that users face during the navigation

00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:49,790
and searching and what we can do we can

00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:53,569
like shortcut we can try to analyze it

00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:56,780
to understand what they really wanted to

00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:59,930
find maybe even even in the cases where

00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:04,400
the users themselves don't don't know

00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:06,190
exactly what they want and to provide

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,000
these shortcuts

00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:14,630
well it's speaking about the relation

00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,810
with the the diversification and its

00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:22,370
comparison to known standard metrics

00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:25,940
like and this is G hope you found we if

00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:29,390
we simply think that there is one

00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:33,160
dimension that we want to diversify we

00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:36,440
should take into account that each place

00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,600
marks and will to fill each place in

00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:42,079
search result page we should decide

00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:44,720
whether this need for intent was already

00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:47,989
filled and the user needs some

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,530
additional product for a given intent or

00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:54,170
if it's time for him ahora to suggest

00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:58,250
something new and this can be calculated

00:03:54,170 --> 00:04:08,299
maybe a undressing to idiot and then a

00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:10,160
belated were proceed okay well I I have

00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:13,880
to I have to tell you one thing so

00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:19,239
before I really looked into this

00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:22,160
diversification topic I was always yeah

00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:25,010
convinced that with the data we have we

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,229
can really model the behavior of the

00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:29,479
users we see out there and and and and

00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:32,479
and and we can serve what they want

00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:34,940
however especially for broad queries or

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,220
inspirational queries when I looked into

00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:39,889
the data there was always this big gap

00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:42,319
between relevancy judgments

00:04:39,889 --> 00:04:44,330
even with click data and and then

00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:46,759
subject matter experts that said yeah

00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:50,120
but all of these are bikes yeah I know

00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:52,669
but I mean if I go into a shop or even

00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,279
if if you ask me you want to buy a bike

00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:57,259
the first question I asked you is yeah

00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:00,349
what kind of bike so what is the purpose

00:04:57,259 --> 00:05:03,229
of this bike and and and right now we we

00:05:00,349 --> 00:05:06,560
cannot really do this of course we have

00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:08,840
facets but still with the facets not not

00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,060
everything may be grouped together in a

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,689
nice way and in Euro bike might be a

00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:18,050
hybrid of different things so I think we

00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:21,680
if we want to put this in a natural

00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:24,219
context then we need to have an

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,990
exploration phase so we need to find out

00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:29,289
and and that's I think is the main goal

00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:32,509
of diversification it's not about

00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:36,110
directly optimizing the relevancy it's

00:05:32,509 --> 00:05:38,689
about getting more information and

00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,819
really try to understand and make it

00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:43,159
happen that we can understand what the

00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:45,469
users actually looking for maybe we're

00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:49,129
always serving the wrong that the wrong

00:05:45,469 --> 00:05:52,849
answer knows it's still it that it gets

00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:55,490
it gets abort but maybe it could we

00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:59,779
could have a 10 times higher conversion

00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:03,589
rate who knows yeah my thoughts on that

00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:06,229
are aligned if you guys like I also were

00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:07,639
surprised like before start start I

00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:09,860
started playing with like versification

00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:12,229
was surprised how many times and maybe

00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,029
tests that I have like clearly something

00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:17,389
that's the wrestler read less relevant

00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:20,060
write perform it better understand why

00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:23,509
and then when I when I start with search

00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:26,210
about this I it's clear like I said I

00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:29,479
said user needs options like relevance

00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:31,819
as the forehead the initial price like

00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:34,399
it's nothing without intent or a lot of

00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:36,620
context and there's the moment you start

00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:38,810
to driven to go in this intent or

00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,460
context you see that different users

00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:43,490
have different needs so diversification

00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:45,620
can help which is ko'd outlet also

00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:48,469
another thing that opened my eyes like

00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,029
in terms of like when you have relevance

00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:51,979
the traditional relevance we look at the

00:06:50,029 --> 00:06:53,790
addict we're okay and the local

00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:57,480
similarities of the document

00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:58,860
against that worry but diverse when you

00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,510
start playing flavors you see that's

00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,400
like actually used to help you look at

00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:05,160
the data worse the similarity between

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,530
the documents no not only I guess the

00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:09,750
query and that's the then when starts

00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:11,220
understanding what do how you can like

00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:16,830
change your research set should be more

00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:20,490
successful yeah this is those are good

00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:22,200
thoughts I think related to that I think

00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:25,200
love you you called this out in your

00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:27,300
slide deck is the idea that you see in

00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:33,270
maybe reinforcement learning discussions

00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:35,580
of exploit versus explore and I wonder I

00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:38,640
wonder what you guys think like is there

00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:41,760
a spectrum there of times we know okay

00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:45,090
the the searcher wants a blue bike with

00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:49,620
this size wheels and that kind of thing

00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:52,800
and we are we feel confident in the sort

00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:56,130
of the relevance and it's more a direct

00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:59,850
ranking where other times where the the

00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:03,360
query is rather broad and or ambiguous

00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:05,310
and it's um there's an exploration and

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,440
if we're ever are really a hundred

00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:11,670
percent on one dimension or the other if

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:14,370
it's somewhere in between well may begin

00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:16,920
also oh because with this list of it

00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:20,280
also I think it's it's a good analogy

00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:22,380
it's a good case to to imagine that

00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,980
you're in a brick-and-mortar store with

00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:31,530
a good and attentive consultants in you

00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:35,130
came to him or to her and say that you

00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:38,640
want bluer mountain bike and then she

00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:42,270
answers that doc look there are a couple

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,490
of blue mountain bikes but is blue color

00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:48,110
is really that important because well I

00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:53,310
have some mother mountain bikes that are

00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:55,260
red or orange or black but they are more

00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:59,670
I don't know cheaper and more efficient

00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:02,240
they look fancier and so on and this

00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:05,320
sort of behavior this sort of

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,450
interaction because well I

00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:09,520
I want again stress that it's about

00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:11,650
communication and this understanding is

00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,350
important if we understand if you can

00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:15,010
give this feedback that we got what you

00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:18,730
wanted

00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:20,200
we understood what you told us and we

00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:24,100
don't know I understood what you told us

00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:26,170
and asked us but we may suggest what you

00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:29,320
really need and if we can distinguish

00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:31,300
between that not just a considerable

00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:36,070
behave with you as a as a damn person

00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:38,590
and well I I'll show three times one

00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:43,840
item that I want to when I want to sell

00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:46,590
and please shut up and take it if it

00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:49,810
will be it can be respectful and

00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:52,900
understanding communication then there

00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:58,060
is a broad well range of possibilities

00:09:52,900 --> 00:10:00,820
and to use the details and if you if you

00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:03,700
look at if you map these kind of

00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:06,100
communities so the is inspirational

00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,980
queries and broad queries on the on the

00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:10,600
long tail graph what you directly see

00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,210
normally is that we are in the short

00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,130
heads so essentially this is the perfect

00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:18,130
place to do machine learning because

00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:20,860
you're not handling sparse data you

00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:24,040
normally with every kind of experiment

00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:26,380
you do you you can be quite sure that

00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,510
you have enough samples and let's say I

00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:31,180
haven't covered that in my talk but I

00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:34,630
wouldn't just put these kind of row

00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:38,020
based approach as let's say a fixed rule

00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:41,200
you could do things like put a bandit in

00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:43,930
front of it and say a try to play these

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,970
different approaches and and maybe the

00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:48,490
Bandit comes even upward yeah these

00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:50,650
don't work at all so put the initial

00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:54,490
search result on top and these these

00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:56,800
these recommended groupings at the

00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:59,290
bottom you never know but now you have

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,080
you have a way of doing that imagine how

00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:04,660
you would do this on a if you just have

00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:08,830
one single result and a single dimension

00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:10,420
to to sort on that I don't even know how

00:11:08,830 --> 00:11:17,080
this might be possible without pinning

00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:18,740
it manually on positions I I like this a

00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,320
lot of having to like

00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:25,209
like one you want on one side to have

00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:28,040
this like exploit but legs won't be like

00:11:25,209 --> 00:11:29,630
personalization let's see it's very

00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,680
personalized it to know is that for the

00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:34,430
use in this and then I have the other

00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:37,339
extreme we can be like recommendations

00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:40,790
of fresh ideas without the query open

00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:43,520
query and I think these are the extremes

00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:47,630
of diversity right and I think it's

00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:50,300
information that's like you put like

00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:55,100
maybe have AB entity to transition this

00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:57,860
aspect array but like what my point is

00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,990
that like we won't shoot the sweet spot

00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:02,660
that you maybe you do don't don't do

00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:05,870
that but you need some interactions to

00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:07,339
to kind of feel those things or even

00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:10,130
much you learn modest and I think also

00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:12,890
in this case diversification also plays

00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:15,350
I wrote this like I don't have

00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:18,459
experience like this on search direct

00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:20,450
but for example maybe diversify

00:12:18,459 --> 00:12:22,190
recommendations can help but you few the

00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:26,450
collaborative field remodel I have

00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:28,370
recommender so can help you to kind of

00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:31,190
at least tailor a little bit like some

00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:34,760
fresh search basic fresh items

00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:36,649
recommender so and then this is like you

00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:40,339
feed those recommendations with

00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:44,390
diversification so I think this is like

00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:48,709
we we have to explore this spectrum and

00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:52,010
I mean we we we already have coped the

00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:54,860
topic of yeah how broad occur you might

00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:58,190
be in in in terms of looking the

00:12:54,860 --> 00:13:00,320
distributions on different metadata but

00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:00,680
there is another thing you should have

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,459
in mind

00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:06,740
I mean the pure result size sometimes

00:13:03,459 --> 00:13:10,000
can be a good sign as well I mean if I

00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:13,040
have thousands of t-shirts in the result

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,700
the chances chances might be good that

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:20,120
from these thousand t-shirts I'm selling

00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:22,130
and I'm oh I only sell hundred and all

00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:25,220
of the on the other nine hundred will

00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:27,860
never be seen and this kind of

00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:30,410
diversification helps you to give them a

00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:32,360
spot at least a couple of times and

00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:34,880
maybe it's the next best

00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,149
a big thing yeah you you never know I

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:41,329
mean that's that's how retail is about

00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:46,450
I'd be curious if you guys just to close

00:13:41,329 --> 00:13:51,740
out this specific topic it sounds like

00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:54,200
what you guys are saying is that I think

00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:56,720
sometimes we can take a information

00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:59,870
retrieval competition like a trek or a

00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:04,130
cago competition and see that there is

00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:06,250
clearly a set of ground truth corpus and

00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:08,959
we optimize for some ground truth and

00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:12,890
perhaps many of us got into this field

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:15,200
with that perspective would you say that

00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:17,750
the maybe this is a leading question but

00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:20,570
would you say that realities of a search

00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:24,019
product a real search product are quite

00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:27,200
more complicated maybe involve multiple

00:14:24,019 --> 00:14:31,399
perspectives of optimization that are

00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:33,589
around along multiple dimensions yeah we

00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:36,620
definitely tend to oversimplify things

00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:41,449
when we model stuff so to model the

00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:45,740
reality is it's really hard and it will

00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:47,899
maybe take 10 years or even longer and

00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:51,170
until we are really able to understand

00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:54,920
how people shop things online and how we

00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:57,670
can get the maximum out of it but at

00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:01,430
least from my point of view without

00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:04,880
exploration I think we will be locked

00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:07,449
soon because then all the top sellers

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:11,660
will almost be the same on every

00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:13,250
marketplace so you will have to buy all

00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,720
the traffic to get on your site because

00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,699
you are the cheapest and that's not a

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,480
good place to be and you need to

00:15:16,699 --> 00:15:23,420
diversify your business as well so yeah

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,029
you need to find ways to to spot the

00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:28,670
differences in for a query or for a

00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:32,269
category page for different audiences

00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:34,310
and meanings I'm under person sure yeah

00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:37,130
I think this is the secret for having a

00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:41,149
health ecosystem and for marketplaces in

00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:43,010
general because like as if you don't

00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:44,660
have ever like sellers that you don't

00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:46,310
guarantee like them and like search

00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:48,500
clicks for those

00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:51,140
was a point of the serozha marketplace

00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:53,330
is bad for the seller bad for the

00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:57,530
marketplace and potentially bad for the

00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:59,990
user as well so I think the key of like

00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:02,630
this diversification special landing

00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:06,710
page I think is very important to

00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:08,750
promote new sellers or not necessarily

00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:11,420
new sellers but new stuff something

00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,200
that's not like purely defined by

00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:15,470
algorithms

00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:21,070
maybe seasonal stuff like breaking the

00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:24,680
cycle of be only Tristan Ramos angry

00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:27,770
well I I would all only add that it's

00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:30,380
like with this diversity problem it's

00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:33,340
like before we just left with text

00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:37,420
relevance and it was a key and then we

00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:41,900
started to use some behavior signals and

00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:43,400
edit some information and so now we are

00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:46,790
talking then it was about

00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:52,370
personalization so we realized that it's

00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:54,110
worth showing for the same query for

00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:56,360
different users if we know something

00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:59,990
about them some different results and

00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:03,470
now we're just trying not what not only

00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:07,370
we're to add some information about this

00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:09,830
intent or these dimensions of that

00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:12,530
should be diversified and there is no

00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:16,040
conflict with the relevance because well

00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:19,820
you can simply think that this old

00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:24,020
relevance it remains but we add this new

00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:26,570
dimension so we can we can judge the

00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:30,440
results by relevance but for the query

00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:33,050
and for one choosen intent and then

00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:35,750
there is another task maybe a bit more

00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:38,060
complicated how to fill in all the

00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:40,460
places on the search result page because

00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:43,070
well we not only take into consideration

00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:46,910
the relevance in the condition that this

00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:50,390
precise intent was made but also this

00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:52,610
probability of this intent being being

00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:56,560
men so well of course it's all it's all

00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:58,990
about proximation and simplification but

00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:02,080
we we are gay

00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:04,650
in deeper and deeper and it's getting

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,750
more complicated and it's it's final

00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:10,390
maybe there is a blender right like it's

00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:12,760
like as you define in andreas like you

00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:14,860
maybe don't want you like to be in the

00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,580
power of larger models or the ranking

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:20,440
algorithms what is a layer of a ring

00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:23,920
that we don't want to like mess up with

00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:25,630
face it it's just a plaintiff like is

00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,400
something that's come of recommendation

00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:30,510
it dispenses the second layer or rank

00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:34,450
that you needed top of search results

00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:37,690
yeah I mean the only thing I potentially

00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:40,179
would like to add is I think that we

00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:41,910
modeled relevance in the typical way

00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:45,460
called the quantitive measurement just

00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:49,300
in on a single dimension and essentially

00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:52,270
it all of these results might be

00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:54,580
relevant for us and maybe for others as

00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:58,030
well but what what is really important

00:18:54,580 --> 00:19:00,130
is real relevance in context so for this

00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:03,600
particular loser user at that particular

00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:05,740
time coming from maybe this site

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:10,630
relevance might be something different

00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:13,450
then judge judges that just judge ten

00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:15,970
thousands of products or or without this

00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:19,780
I think that's the thing you just cannot

00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:22,660
generalize it it you're saying yes

00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:24,030
there's one question from Matteo Catina

00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:26,650
hopefully I'm getting that name right

00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:32,679
how do you represent relevance judgments

00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:37,090
for diversification or what you guys

00:19:32,679 --> 00:19:39,940
think yeah I mean there you can still

00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:42,840
use the same stuff as before so I mean

00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:45,970
how we are currently I mean cough it

00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:47,710
took us the chance to to already present

00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,910
some numbers because we initially plan

00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:51,280
to have this life together with the

00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:53,380
customer so I don't have it yet but at

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,910
least I can tell you how the way how we

00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:58,410
approach it right now and want to do it

00:19:54,910 --> 00:20:03,400
so we would still have relevancy

00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:06,130
judgments and and these judgments would

00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:10,240
apply on the initial result set but on

00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:12,700
top of that if we see that let's say the

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:16,810
actual usage of the products that

00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:18,610
show them is it's not on a sweet spot

00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:21,130
let's say always on the top so it's it's

00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:23,440
everywhere around the result even after

00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:25,720
refining the result then this is a clear

00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:28,900
signal for us that we might want to

00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:31,960
diversify it and there you can just use

00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:34,930
your typical user signals as well like

00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:37,960
click-through rates add two cards byes

00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:40,750
and all these things and and and what

00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:43,900
you essentially do is you have a second

00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:49,500
layer ranking that just tries to

00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:51,210
optimize a ranked set for this

00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:53,950
particular context

00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:56,200
this is how I see it I don't know if

00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:58,270
it's if it plays out well but it's the

00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,030
only way I can imagine how to solve the

00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:04,600
issues I see with the data I mean it's

00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:06,880
it's obvious in this field of like a I

00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:11,620
don't know table dancer but one thing

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:15,360
that come to my mind is that I can't see

00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:18,070
maybe with human manual judgments like

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:20,680
what if like for a query we try to

00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:24,670
collect the documents for our persona or

00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:26,290
assuming an intent of course need a lot

00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:28,060
of knowledge domain knowledge for this

00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:30,670
but that's assuming that you can like

00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:32,800
collect the interpretation of I I can

00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:34,540
always phone for different things and

00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:38,260
then you have different judgment lists

00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:40,300
right you run like you optimize for each

00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:42,070
of this query plus intent so and this is

00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,530
no extra dimension that put your query

00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:47,140
right and then you have the best ranking

00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:49,780
for each query pleasant things the

00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:51,850
questions now is the plant you have your

00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:53,710
final result set and you can blend all

00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:56,470
this you can interleave basically all

00:21:53,710 --> 00:22:00,250
these three judgments and then you are

00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:02,050
your model has to maximize the the ends

00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:05,470
each year I don't know any other metric

00:22:02,050 --> 00:22:08,320
of it isn't I'll leave it final result

00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:10,770
sets because if they assume that you

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,600
have to put everything the same scale

00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:16,510
and then you are going to have a result

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,880
sets I agree that like maybe your model

00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:21,280
pick like the first intent for the first

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,140
query but then you can like try to

00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,720
measure second metrics that we discussed

00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:26,700
here like to make it special this would

00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:33,750
how much in danger

00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:37,110
rain snow with an idea like yes go ahead

00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:39,810
maybe another read some some some

00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:42,240
questions about the user interface and I

00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:46,910
think it's it's also a very challenging

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:51,540
task to somehow mix will merge this

00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:54,480
designer you you it's use tasks with our

00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:57,180
optimization test because well if we

00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:01,230
talk when we talk about metrics in this

00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:04,340
is a for example or he found they are

00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:07,200
popular because they somehow quite good

00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:11,490
approximate the users behavior there is

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:15,660
a model that users for example they scan

00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:19,490
the results from top to bottom and when

00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:22,080
we talk about diversification and

00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:24,650
different intents and even if we can

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:30,900
have these judgments for each pair of

00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:33,420
incent and document we need to resolve a

00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:36,390
bit the different tasks we need to

00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:40,650
calculate what's the probability that

00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:43,110
all the previously shown results weren't

00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:47,070
sufficient but the intent was right were

00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:51,000
a new intent beneath and when we need or

00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:53,700
try different ways of presenting the

00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,510
results different ways of grouping what

00:23:53,700 --> 00:24:01,920
unreal showed us or clustering or maybe

00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:04,230
some different size that products can

00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,660
occupy on this products out page then

00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:09,570
maybe this models will change and it's

00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:11,820
well I have no idea told how to measure

00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:17,430
this but it's it would be great if we

00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:22,770
could combine some interface decisions

00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:26,310
with some optimization and somehow judge

00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:30,980
and assesses what what gets what we get

00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:34,560
in the results yeah thanks

00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:37,200
one more question from Rene that I think

00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:39,660
is interesting is and I'll try to

00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,270
summarize suppressive is

00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:43,830
I think it's a lot of approaches that

00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:45,410
I've seen her diversity and I think some

00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:48,660
of the things you guys have presented

00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:51,270
rely on the distribution of say

00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:54,840
categories and the index or how the

00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:57,540
index is represented we've also talked a

00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:00,080
little bit about how diversification

00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:04,010
really is trying to get at multiple

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:08,280
possible senses of the users intent and

00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:10,710
I wonder if maybe there's a mismatch

00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:13,110
there and if there's anything we can do

00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:17,220
about that like maybe we should be

00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:20,430
reaching and tracking for what the users

00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:24,060
intents are and asking sort of asking

00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:27,090
the question are we correctly capturing

00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:29,550
the probability of their intention given

00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:32,280
what we know about keyword and the user

00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:34,770
I just

00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:37,590
quite quite shortly one-one decide

00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:40,710
because well maybe I I expressed my idea

00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:44,720
Rowen I I saw Renee's question from my

00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:48,000
point of view the amount of items

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:50,700
allocated one design one category in the

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,580
database in the product base has nothing

00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:56,490
to do with calculating the intents of

00:25:53,580 --> 00:26:00,420
the users so when they don't match it's

00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:00,960
a signal that something is wrong in this

00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:04,260
database

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:08,010
we can't force the user just by some

00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:11,190
some source of goods just because we

00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:14,820
have a lot of them in destroy available

00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:17,430
and when one - so it's just when we talk

00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:21,870
about these distributions distributions

00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:25,170
these are distributions on the set of

00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:29,190
products that users already interacted

00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:31,650
with and yeah maybe maybe a hundred

00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:40,080
percent of this category and maybe one

00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:45,660
percent can be different yeah my fault

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:48,780
on that had maybe - it is like when I

00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:50,850
for example let's assume for the first

00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,840
edges that you have is - a criteria -

00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:53,880
kind of

00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:56,970
the government's not necessary category

00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:58,830
but agree that if you do it like I did

00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:01,770
for that completes is only the perspect

00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:05,159
of the diamond but what it can offer

00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:08,010
actually to the user like what if like

00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:09,750
we can derive this the similar

00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:11,669
distribution for the clique distribution

00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:14,100
and you believe that you will see that

00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:16,620
what users search more for less you can

00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:18,960
maybe distributed the writings too

00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:20,309
follows into this category you have a

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,130
higher probably that's the higher

00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:27,149
cricket category and then you assigned

00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:30,330
today another one another thing that is

00:27:27,149 --> 00:27:33,510
like from the surgeon wallet is like

00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:36,450
from web search they try to do that with

00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:39,809
a bunch of algorithms there was one

00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:43,559
special algorithm that I had the chance

00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:46,070
working casual guide with Ashraf and we

00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:47,970
basically is called MMR with marginal

00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:49,620
maximum marginal relevance

00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:51,570
you'll have your irrelevance and you

00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:53,580
find the seconds for that measure how

00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:56,610
different you are from where you pick it

00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:58,919
right and there one of the iterations

00:27:56,610 --> 00:28:01,200
that we did the first one yeah we lie on

00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:03,960
the Kotak categories but the second one

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,179
we'll use it more like this which like

00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,159
there wasn't like mudflow dimensions

00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:11,070
right so basically you have a seat yet

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,659
and then you cut the second one the most

00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:15,149
relevant one and then you measure how

00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:18,330
similar this item this is from the first

00:28:15,149 --> 00:28:21,270
one using more like this which like a

00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:24,809
multi-mission like a similarity metric

00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:26,730
so it worked for it was interesting and

00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:29,520
you measure the coverage later and we

00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:38,730
had the real diversity results doing

00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:42,270
that oh yeah I I mean I

00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:44,370
we've never went a life with something

00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:45,240
we didn't had a customer that does

00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:48,450
something like that

00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:51,390
I was just spotting gaps in the data and

00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:55,260
there was no clear explanation for that

00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:58,080
and the idea of let's say row based

00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:00,659
groupings and rankings essentially came

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:02,820
to my mind when I saw how Netflix and

00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:05,130
and other streaming

00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:05,580
people are doing that because they're

00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:07,650
you

00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:10,710
a lot of different intents and you have

00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:12,900
limited space on the screen and there

00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:16,110
you really need to diversify and and

00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:21,330
diversify in a lot of different areas so

00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:25,320
it can be the the Java it can be by by

00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:28,290
maybe interesting actors because I'm

00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:31,320
always looking the the same actors and

00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:34,050
and I mean they prove that these systems

00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:38,880
are superior to let's say normal

00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:41,760
relevance based algorithms but we have

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,490
to prove that for for e-commerce I would

00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,310
say I mean I know that Amazon is already

00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:49,110
doing it for some pages I don't know how

00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:53,100
they do it but I know that they are

00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:55,140
doing it yeah let's let's try it I mean

00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:59,780
now we have the tools to do it and let's

00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:59,780
try it and see if it's a success or not

00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:05,880
yeah that's awesome one I think Tito

00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,750
made a series of really interesting

00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:12,810
points just now in the in the in the

00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:15,300
slack where he mentions sort of user

00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:17,430
specific goals in the context of a query

00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:19,830
and you have subdomains I mean we're all

00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:22,770
or primarily focused on e-commerce now

00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:27,450
but there are some domains sometimes

00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:29,070
even within e-commerce where it's there

00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:31,110
so there are some domains where it's the

00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:33,210
focus is really like serendipity and

00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:35,160
sometimes giving users things they

00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:37,770
didn't know they expected and there are

00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:40,350
other domains where the problem is much

00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:43,670
more about sort of a notion of

00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:49,080
comprehensiveness relative to the query

00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:51,300
yeah I'd be curious to what extent for

00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:53,820
example research might be a domain like

00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:56,000
that and maybe also the commerce I'd be

00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:59,570
curious to what extent diversity

00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,610
strategies need to change to handle

00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:06,360
different maybe ultimate goals that

00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:08,100
diversity might might serve or if

00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:10,730
there's maybe even some problems with

00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,730
the university

00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:19,009
yeah definitely I mean one that was

00:31:15,830 --> 00:31:22,759
already been pointed out is the the time

00:31:19,009 --> 00:31:25,429
dimension so a word can have a

00:31:22,759 --> 00:31:28,970
completely different context when time

00:31:25,429 --> 00:31:32,480
goes by I saw this a couple of times in

00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:34,490
the data as well where when when ice age

00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,289
came out I see four it was always clear

00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:38,750
what you have to serve and then people

00:31:36,289 --> 00:31:40,279
were just searching for eyes and and

00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:42,710
nobody was really clicking on ice

00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:43,190
anymore they all wanted to see ice ages

00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:48,710
on top

00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:51,110
I mean without exploration or I mean the

00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:53,059
kind of using user feedback so when they

00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:56,059
reformulate stuff they don't find what

00:31:53,059 --> 00:31:57,769
they're they were looking for and then

00:31:56,059 --> 00:31:59,659
do something so when you capture the

00:31:57,769 --> 00:32:02,779
whole session that's nothing else in my

00:31:59,659 --> 00:32:05,509
opinion that exploration but it's the

00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:08,570
hard way because how many percent of

00:32:05,509 --> 00:32:11,090
your users will will be gentle enough to

00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:13,549
do these kind of things a lot of them

00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:17,210
will just bounce off and and you will

00:32:13,549 --> 00:32:20,990
potentially never see them so I think

00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:23,330
there's a lot to cover a lot ground to

00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:28,519
cover and even Google doesn't do a

00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:30,649
perfect there yet always space for for

00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:33,529
improvements and new opportunities yeah

00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:36,559
well I just wanted to add that even here

00:32:33,529 --> 00:32:38,659
in our session if we try to answer would

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:42,590
discuss some questions about variation

00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:44,289
we always limit this diversity to one

00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:48,409
dimension because well it's already

00:32:44,289 --> 00:32:51,649
something new and what Andy said is

00:32:48,409 --> 00:32:54,529
important that not just we have multiple

00:32:51,649 --> 00:32:57,019
dimensions to diversify but we

00:32:54,529 --> 00:33:01,070
understand that all these distributions

00:32:57,019 --> 00:33:04,190
of parameters their values even if we

00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:07,940
calculate them not on the product base

00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:10,460
but on the products that users

00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:14,750
interacted with their conditional so

00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:17,779
well maybe just like with the color if

00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:21,620
you are looking for a blue mountain bike

00:33:17,779 --> 00:33:24,379
maybe blue won't be that important for

00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:25,010
you and even if we look at all the bikes

00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:28,160
that

00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:32,540
but after someone looked for blue bikes

00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:34,370
maybe we can understand whether this

00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:37,549
particular parameter this particular

00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:40,970
value that you were explicitly asked for

00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:43,340
is that important or not and with brands

00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:48,470
yeah and so well it can be really

00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:50,450
complicated yeah yeah I think that's the

00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:53,150
tricky part is work because if you go

00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:55,570
like web search research there was this

00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:59,660
MMR decimation bunch of other algorithms

00:33:55,570 --> 00:34:01,870
but they assumed that like the process

00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:05,299
of course of reading a document is

00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:07,610
easier than like but something and then

00:34:05,299 --> 00:34:10,940
when you run through choose between on

00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:13,129
document to another is like and if it's

00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:14,090
maybe you have more information so is

00:34:13,129 --> 00:34:15,619
this you know that something is

00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:18,379
different and we're going to skip it and

00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:20,240
then they they optimize is for avoid

00:34:18,379 --> 00:34:22,730
every Dulles when when you talk about

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:25,460
like e-commerce for example we need some

00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:27,889
redundant strip and per so I think that

00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:29,899
that's the trickiest part but I believe

00:34:27,889 --> 00:34:32,330
in the both case like web search and

00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:35,210
then you can consider like a diverse as

00:34:32,330 --> 00:34:39,409
investment like sometimes you have some

00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:42,800
vests like you sacrifice sure maybe like

00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:45,320
don't put your all your bags or rags the

00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:48,470
same basket like you for I could try to

00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:51,290
verse fight to minimize the loss because

00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:53,899
if you have multiple repetitions if you

00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:55,790
have like different baskets you put your

00:34:53,899 --> 00:34:58,970
X you maximize your chance just

00:34:55,790 --> 00:35:01,820
successful and then maybe it came back

00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:05,390
to that spectrum as the moment you find

00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:10,280
out that you maybe can exploit and solve

00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:13,310
this problem yeah thanks I think it's

00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:15,340
really interesting that you know when I

00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:20,240
think about this problem it seems to be

00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:23,600
almost this this when we encounter a

00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:26,660
keyword almost this first question we

00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:29,390
can't we can't assume we have more than

00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:31,609
a keyword for example in search or when

00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:33,880
we do have more than the keyword we have

00:35:31,609 --> 00:35:38,450
to be really gentle with how we use it

00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:41,420
and it almost feels like in

00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:44,270
search and this has been true just

00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:47,060
focused purely on a relevance problem we

00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:48,589
have to look at a keyword and think you

00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:50,030
know what is the what is the intention

00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:52,220
behind this query and I think

00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:54,109
historically we've we've maybe thought

00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:55,940
of that as one intention like I will

00:35:54,109 --> 00:35:58,880
steer you in this one direction because

00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:02,150
I think you want a mountain bike that is

00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:04,930
blue and I will give you everything in

00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:07,490
that category and I will rank somehow

00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:10,670
but it feels like and I'd be curious

00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:13,160
what you guys think this this topic of

00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:14,630
diversity is also about this maybe that

00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:18,290
first block when you encounter the

00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:20,180
keywords of of intention but really

00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:22,760
instead of a single answer we get a

00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:25,609
probability distribution back and then

00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:28,010
with depending on each little maybe each

00:36:25,609 --> 00:36:29,900
each of those intentions however we

00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:33,920
model that which is very domain-specific

00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:36,829
and challenging we almost have in there

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,829
a relevance problem so it's it's almost

00:36:36,829 --> 00:36:41,180
like relevance is the thing happening

00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:45,260
within each attention and

00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:46,819
diversification is the thing that that

00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:49,400
that probability distribution will we

00:36:46,819 --> 00:36:53,750
have to somehow grasp at all the

00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:56,180
possible intentions yeah that's

00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:59,210
definitely the case there are a lot of a

00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:02,150
lot of examples for that like I have

00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:04,430
this this this this cool example my

00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:08,750
opinion in the fashion industry so we we

00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:12,740
saw quite some traffic on red Valentino

00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:14,510
dress and we we saw like how the KPIs

00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:16,400
where we're moving and it wasn't

00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:20,060
particularly well and then I explored

00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:23,210
that yeah it is ambiguous because the

00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:26,089
user might might search for a red dress

00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:26,930
from Valentino but there is also a

00:37:26,089 --> 00:37:28,550
subgrant

00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:32,240
of manettino which is called red

00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:34,310
Valentino and and so it's that this red

00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:38,200
doesn't really need to be a color it

00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:40,940
could also be related to a label and I

00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:43,819
shouldn't just pre-filter or make a

00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:46,490
judgment out of it if the if the

00:37:43,819 --> 00:37:49,579
distribution is not clear for us so give

00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:51,619
the user both results or or make make

00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:52,250
clear that we are not sure that we group

00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:56,270
there is

00:37:52,250 --> 00:38:00,560
in both or in two sections and then by

00:37:56,270 --> 00:38:03,710
by clicking you can easily do what he

00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,150
wants and and get what he wants I should

00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:08,510
say we're about out of time so I think

00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:10,940
this is a good final thought if Lev and

00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:14,150
Philippe if you want to on this sort of

00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:16,670
this notion if you guys have any final

00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:20,599
thoughts on diversity or diversity

00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:24,619
related to this distribution tense I

00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:27,380
have one final thought like yeah I think

00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:29,510
it it with a magician like you have

00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:32,570
multiple combinations that you can drive

00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:35,300
and just looked like she finishes like

00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:36,530
may be related to this can also bring

00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:38,450
hardscapes like there was this paper

00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:41,180
that Hindi Sheree first like when I

00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:44,300
started about Spotify and then how he's

00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:46,010
trying to diversify and it's very

00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:49,640
interesting because for then it was

00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:52,130
almost like that like they're the kind

00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:54,950
of have a nice paper Austin paper chose

00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:58,490
like yours that the yours that has more

00:38:54,950 --> 00:39:03,560
diverse the core generalist music tasty

00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:05,869
they have a better retention and and

00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:08,450
they thing a bit like it user and their

00:39:05,869 --> 00:39:10,520
taste as like I the factory space and

00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:12,619
that smooth put that that's not like

00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:15,349
this because when you are user as a

00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:18,020
specialist is concentrate and then ever

00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:20,210
finish their very own way one way to all

00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:22,430
kind of like recommenced before them and

00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:24,530
their algorithms look it's very good

00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:26,300
much better for the generalists but

00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:27,890
really compare over time over time

00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:29,960
afternoon year two years I think they

00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:32,150
went through back past two years it was

00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:34,010
a who had a more general taste like the

00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:36,800
the vectors are more different like this

00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:38,900
song song vectors and the distaste user

00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:41,990
taste vector they have a better

00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:44,330
reputation so I think it's this kind of

00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:46,280
investment stuff that I think is it pays

00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:48,380
investment like for long term like at

00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:51,470
least for Spotify diversify the

00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:56,720
diversified results like we make the

00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:58,820
users use more attachment I just wanted

00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:01,790
to add that from my perspective it's

00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:04,430
nothing you we have the same old tasks

00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:06,109
we need to increase conversion rate and

00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:09,890
sales

00:40:06,109 --> 00:40:13,519
diversification can help but yeah we go

00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:15,440
deeper and we model may be different the

00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:19,910
users behavior and speaking about

00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:22,069
metrics if we come to next level if we

00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:24,739
can track the conversion rate in terms

00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:28,670
of users if we understand that there are

00:40:24,739 --> 00:40:31,880
super sessions like nd already mentioned

00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:35,089
that some types of products you can

00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:38,390
choose for weeks and maybe months and

00:40:35,089 --> 00:40:40,160
when you can add the information about

00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:42,799
the experience with the product whether

00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:45,549
the user was satisfied or not so well a

00:40:42,799 --> 00:40:49,430
huge amount of data but this model in

00:40:45,549 --> 00:40:51,319
makes sense if we manage to do it the

00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:53,509
results in our interaction in our

00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:58,819
communication with the users will be

00:40:53,509 --> 00:41:00,200
better yeah thank you this has been a

00:40:58,819 --> 00:41:03,589
real interesting panel I really

00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:05,960
appreciate Felipe Andreas and live

00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:08,739
thanks so much for for your talks in

00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,739
your insights so
