I think we move on further we have next

00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:18,170
talk from again from lucky he would be

00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:23,390
talking about the sim-based

00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:25,820
spell correctly welcome back lucky one

00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:28,280
so now so this one I'm going to talk

00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,500
about the spell the spell correction and

00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:34,520
the quiz segmentation part which is like

00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:37,879
the one of the basic things which we

00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:42,890
need to encounter and e-commerce search

00:00:37,879 --> 00:00:45,890
searches so the idea which we so we

00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,600
created a simple based customized Java

00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,579
elimination of that the Simpsons

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,250
basically written personally by will

00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:55,520
draw a MC shop so we have adopted that

00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:58,070
and right it's Java port but add on to

00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,790
that we added some custom customizations

00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:02,120
to that also

00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:03,530
so basically what simple comprises of is

00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,299
basically comprises of the single word

00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,409
spelling correction the compound the

00:01:05,299 --> 00:01:09,500
will manatee with spelling Corrections

00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:11,869
like the word breaking and the word

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,850
joining part for an example nut free

00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:17,060
chocolates without space and with space

00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:20,209
and we added the quality distance to

00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:23,749
that so if someone is like typing slice

00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:26,779
and in the index we have slices and

00:01:23,749 --> 00:01:29,209
olives so if I look at the Edit distance

00:01:26,779 --> 00:01:30,920
both have their distance one in the

00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:35,329
beginning but if I look at the keyboard

00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:37,459
I see that compared to slack slice

00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:40,399
compared to olives the s in the word

00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:42,920
basically a poles apart they're on the

00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:45,649
opposite side of the keyboard but if I

00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,950
see at the VNC of slides and slices that

00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:51,619
basically absent so this gives a major

00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:54,499
weight eight that this is more closer to

00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:56,719
the original word so in that case the

00:01:54,499 --> 00:01:58,399
qwerty distance will help us the other

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,219
part is we have integrated this simple

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,469
two solar or we have cried one component

00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:06,950
on that simple so that can be easily

00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:09,020
used so which leverages us to use search

00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,330
engine data as a dictionary so what

00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,530
happens with any spell caption is like

00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:16,210
you need to provide a text when you do

00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:18,860
that so if I am writing a dictionary and

00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:20,810
I'm having a new planet

00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,660
Dan at all

00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:25,610
and if someone misspelled it it will not

00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,970
get autocorrected ante unless we have

00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:31,820
that word in your dictionary and our

00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:33,470
spell character knows about it so with

00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,480
the leverage of the integration we get a

00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:39,170
part where we can read the index data

00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:42,740
and create that dictionary on either on

00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:44,959
on every commit operation or any reload

00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:47,750
operation so that's what we did and

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,250
there is one more idea on base of spell

00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,200
is like a context-based spelling

00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:53,650
correction so context is Ella

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,830
Christensen like if I have if I type the

00:02:53,650 --> 00:02:58,580
MA

00:02:54,830 --> 00:03:00,800
LK right which could be milk or want

00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:03,080
so basically which one would be

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,800
appropriate so if a person is like

00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:10,310
browsing the beverages and if I if he

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:13,100
types no mal k then it surely means mud

00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:17,000
but if it's like browsing the groceries

00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:19,160
and it I am al k then it means milk so

00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,440
what we are currently doing is that we

00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,000
are creating kinetic space we are Bank

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,709
approach and count encounter this

00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,390
problem of kinetics misspelling

00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:31,459
Corrections using the simple so as I

00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:34,720
mentioned right there examples like not

00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:37,730
free without space and strong milk and

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,930
let's say we don't even even find to see

00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:41,450
the skimmed minute result because it

00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:43,880
basically correcting of one word ants

00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:45,830
miss Kelly splitting over so also but

00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,209
semi spell is basically a symmetry

00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:49,610
delete spelling correction algorithm

00:03:47,209 --> 00:03:53,840
which basically reduces the complexity

00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:56,390
of added Canada technician it basically

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,100
much faster and language independent so

00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,769
basically we have also created along

00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:03,890
with QWERTY we have created the codes

00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:04,459
the keyboard for German and it is much

00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:07,070
faster

00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:11,720
because it basically creates the delete

00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:13,700
dictionary so that it all Italy added

00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,950
distance as a time while reading the

00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:18,169
dictionary itself so here are some

00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:21,109
matrices so compared to knowledge

00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:23,600
bigotry Lin spell see misspell performs

00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:26,720
much better on a five hundred thousand

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:30,710
word dictionary when such time for 1000

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,470
words so this is what the quotation

00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,159
symmetric matrix we use so we see that

00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:38,629
we

00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:40,069
is connecting to both C F G and B so we

00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:42,080
made them on the business of like

00:04:40,069 --> 00:04:44,569
directly connectivity and the diagonal

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,669
connectivity so direct connectivity has

00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:47,839
a very short windage and background

00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:50,629
connectivity is slightly higher with

00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:51,979
this compared direct connectivity and we

00:04:50,629 --> 00:04:54,169
use the these weights in the

00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:56,029
dominologist GN calculation where we

00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:58,339
basically multiplies it with the replace

00:04:56,029 --> 00:05:01,300
distance so double all that this chain

00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:04,389
is nothing but the added basically are

00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,740
what you should I say it's a basically a

00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:08,929
it's a around two levenshtein distance

00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,300
which also calculates it transpositions

00:05:08,929 --> 00:05:13,879
other words of the captives in this one

00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:16,550
we basically added add on to it like we

00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:17,869
added that you can also add weights with

00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:19,909
specific operations like you can add

00:05:17,869 --> 00:05:22,490
weights to insert operation delete

00:05:19,909 --> 00:05:24,139
operation so by default it's on one but

00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:26,059
if you want to say that it could be

00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:28,099
delete provable so you can reduce the

00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:29,959
delete weight and you can basically play

00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:32,269
with these weights to find out what

00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:34,689
could be the possible best approach for

00:05:32,269 --> 00:05:37,489
you for your echo system

00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:39,769
so this is our accuracy summary so when

00:05:37,489 --> 00:05:43,059
we index like three thousand 695 indexes

00:05:39,769 --> 00:05:46,039
and did eight thousand sixty searches

00:05:43,059 --> 00:05:49,249
with leucine was giving a lot of false

00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:50,990
negatives which was 1550 but when we

00:05:49,249 --> 00:05:53,389
tried with vanilla same spill it gives

00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:55,009
545 false negatives and we when we tried

00:05:53,389 --> 00:05:57,369
with QWERTY P is vanilla semi spelled to

00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:59,419
us 573 also negatives

00:05:57,369 --> 00:06:02,240
similarly the true positives also

00:05:59,419 --> 00:06:04,849
increased compared to losing and that's

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,029
why we plan it to Sola to move it to

00:06:04,849 --> 00:06:10,099
Sola so that we can leverage the more

00:06:08,029 --> 00:06:15,800
accuracy comes what we're getting from

00:06:10,099 --> 00:06:17,869
sipping so that's all this is the github

00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,579
link for the customized a misspelled I'm

00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:22,309
open source that it's available in maven

00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:24,319
central so you can let me use it few

00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:28,279
companies are already trying to use it

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:32,689
and he is Melanie and thank you everyone

00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:35,509
that's all I have any questions great

00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:38,360
super talk I think I was looking forward

00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:41,569
to for to this one please graph it

00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,399
tonight yes we have questions there are

00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:44,839
few questions that I actually can add

00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:47,150
but I think you answered all of them I

00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:49,040
was wanting to see if we compared it

00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:51,440
existing solar spellchecker I think you

00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:52,910
covered that plus the plan to

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,710
incorporate that in solar as well I

00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:57,410
think you've covered that to me so both

00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:59,510
of my questions are answered but we have

00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:01,760
one question from Ian's and he asks you

00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:05,810
that is there a way to combine Keeper

00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:07,400
and D for distance measures combine

00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,810
keyboard I didn't get that so like

00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,540
combining even and D for distance

00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:13,940
measures thousand if I I'm getting the

00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:15,740
question correct it's like you are

00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,780
trying to put a default distance

00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:28,150
measures along with the what the

00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:30,680
distance is it yeah I think yes yes so

00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:33,530
another question coming in from Senate

00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,750
he says that you mentioned compounds he

00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:39,100
and it handle compounds of three more

00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:43,010
words or compounds that have in fixes

00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:44,780
yeah definitely so that's what yeah it

00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:47,600
can handle that so suppose I am writing

00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,340
like I am a force going to market

00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,860
without special air in the jungle and

00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:54,110
without with spaces like in it you know

00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:57,380
accommodate for Foreman it will be it

00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:59,360
basically corrects them it did right

00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,250
I cannot wait to try it actually and

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,690
I'll let you know and I'm really excited

00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:07,580
that it's getting incorporated into

00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:08,630
solar so that was a great shock and high

00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,690
enough a food for thought

00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:13,580
for tonight at least so thank you so

00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:16,870
much for great lucky I think we would

00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,870
see you around on these social

00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,680
