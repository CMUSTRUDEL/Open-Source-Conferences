2020 has heightened our attention for multiple difficult problems without clear solutions including the COVID-19 pandemic, a global economic downturns, and police violence.  These problems fit the pattern of "Wicked Problems" as originally described by Rittel and Weber in 1973.  Wicked Problems, are systemic problems without a clear formulation, and without clear solutions.  Despite the difficulties in understanding and solving these problems, some organizations are better equipped than others for making progress on them.  Surprisingly, many of these organizations share a common hallmark: the ability to promote women into positions of leadership.

I will explain what Wicked Problems are, look at examples where we are succeeding at mitigating these problems, and examine commonalities that arise across successful approaches.  Then I will present two examples in which Women in Open Source, Open Data, and Open Standards are helping to make the world a better place both in the context of COVID-19, and in the context of the broader problems humanity faces.

hi everybody I am going to talk today to

00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:17,029
you about how women and opensource lead

00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:20,000
in times of coronavirus first I would

00:00:17,029 --> 00:00:22,340
like to introduce myself my name is

00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,140
Merle Krantz I'm a former board member

00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:26,420
of the Apache Software Foundation

00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:29,000
I was also conference chair in last year

00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:31,460
at Apache Con in Berlin I am currently

00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,309
the treasurer at Apache and I'm also an

00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:36,440
individual contributor for a couple of

00:00:34,309 --> 00:00:39,680
different humanitarian that's what the H

00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:41,720
in H ba stands for humanitarian free and

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,629
open-source software projects for

00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,909
example effective in Iraq and I also did

00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:53,390
a hackathon for openmrs a couple years

00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:56,210
ago so first let's ask what makes corona

00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:58,939
virus so challenging why is this such a

00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:00,650
difficult problem to solve well if we

00:00:58,939 --> 00:01:02,299
look at it from multiple sides we can

00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:05,089
see for example a corona virus has a

00:01:02,299 --> 00:01:05,540
huge economic impact even without the

00:01:05,089 --> 00:01:09,950
lockdown

00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:12,979
the loss of life the loss of time has

00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:15,619
just a significant amount of cost to

00:01:12,979 --> 00:01:17,929
humanity finding reliable and accurate

00:01:15,619 --> 00:01:21,920
information about corona virus and about

00:01:17,929 --> 00:01:23,600
its effects can be difficult the

00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,159
information flow in a relationship

00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,079
building that we perform in the world

00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:31,130
today has been interrupted by social

00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:33,380
distancing and by the changing work

00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:34,460
situations so those are problems that we

00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,679
have to solve those out there have been

00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:39,130
massive changes in government assistance

00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:41,929
as governments have stepped up to

00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:43,819
strengthen their social network there

00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:45,439
have been increases in spending they've

00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:47,659
been changes and programs that have been

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,999
that need to be communicated and brought

00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:51,920
to the people that are meant to help

00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:55,939
secure data exchange for legislators has

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,710
been a problem voting work for

00:01:55,939 --> 00:01:59,420
legislators who aren't there and you

00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:01,639
would traditionally insisted that their

00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:04,189
members be there homeschooling for

00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:05,240
parents who still have to work while

00:02:04,189 --> 00:02:08,509
they're solving all of these other

00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:11,180
problems there have been sudden massive

00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:13,819
changes to supply chain chains differing

00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:16,070
needs factories no longer able to

00:02:13,819 --> 00:02:17,930
produce factories needing to produce

00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:20,750
different things transportation being

00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:23,150
interrupted and other

00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:26,210
CAIR without it was social distancing

00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:29,900
has also been a problem so what to all

00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:32,510
of these problems have in common many of

00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:35,030
these problems even all of these

00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:37,640
problems are wicked problems and wicked

00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:39,050
problems is a sort of problem a kind of

00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,800
problem that has been recognized since

00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:48,050
the early 1970s wicked problems is the

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,550
classic paradigm or rather it is a

00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,440
description of a problem for which the

00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:55,820
classic paradigm of science and

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:58,820
engineering fails the paradigm that has

00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:00,830
under Lane modern professionalism just

00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:03,380
doesn't work in these kinds of problems

00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:05,780
because their system problems they're

00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,489
cyclical those societal problems and

00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:10,700
they're inherently different from the

00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:12,380
problems that engineers do is so what is

00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:15,080
a wicked problem well it's not just a

00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:16,790
hard problem it's a problem that moves

00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,709
away from you when you try to solve it

00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:22,730
or even moves away from you when you try

00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:24,200
to understand it so a wicked problem is

00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:27,860
a problem for which knowledge is

00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:30,170
incomplete or even contradictory for

00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:33,080
which there's a huge number of people

00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:35,269
and opinions involved also contradictory

00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:37,420
it's a problem was a large economic

00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:39,500
burden at least within its context and

00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:42,019
it's very interconnected

00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:44,120
there are not only cyclical dependencies

00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:50,150
there's multiple cyclical dependencies

00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:54,980
so it's a system problem it's a system

00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:56,870
problem in which the parts have no clear

00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:59,030
separation from each other there's no

00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:02,959
definitive formulation of a wicked

00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:05,000
problem so for the coronavirus are we

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,860
balancing the corona virus transmission

00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,400
against economic damage or what counts

00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:13,549
as economic damage with the problems

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,350
have no stopping rule that is you don't

00:04:13,549 --> 00:04:17,690
know when you're finished solving them

00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:19,400
how much coronavirus transmission is

00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:21,799
acceptable do we really want to set that

00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:25,100
at zero how much disease transmission in

00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:28,729
general is acceptable solutions to

00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:31,669
wicked problems are not true or false

00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:34,400
they're good or bad there are moral

00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:36,560
problems and when a problem is a more

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,130
problems and conflicts that stem from

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,419
competing value systems come into it

00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:44,060
questions like questions of

00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:48,770
self-determination versus the care for

00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:52,340
the societal good arise there's no

00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:53,930
immediate or ultimate test for the

00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:56,720
solution of away the problem precisely

00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:59,509
because there's differing value systems

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,009
from which you could approach it every

00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:05,120
solution to wicked problem is a one-shot

00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:07,430
operation you do it but once you've done

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,780
it you can't do another experiment and

00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,639
say the situation is the same because

00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:14,080
it's not every solution changes that

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:16,190
there's no AV testing there's no

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,620
enumerable set of possibilities as to

00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:20,000
how to solve it

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,830
but every wicked problem is unique so

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,780
for example coronavirus transmission in

00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:26,090
Japan is different than current average

00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,139
transmission in Italy because family

00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:29,389
living situations are different

00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:31,190
willingness to wear masks is different

00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:32,800
population density is different so the

00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:35,449
solutions are going to be different

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:40,360
every wicked problem can be considered

00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:43,370
to be a symptom of another problem so

00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,630
you might consider coronavirus a symptom

00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,370
of people not being willing to wear

00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,690
masks but if people wear masks then they

00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:49,669
might spend more time in groups which

00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:53,990
increases for an A virus transmission

00:05:49,669 --> 00:05:58,750
um it's sometimes it doesn't work the

00:05:53,990 --> 00:06:00,560
way you expect it to so the existence of

00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:03,320
discrepancy a thing that you want to

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,880
change can be explained in multiple ways

00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,110
within the context what we committed

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,210
here I'm going to take a step out of the

00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:10,250
corona virus for a moment and talk about

00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,740
the riots in the u.s. are riots caused

00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:15,530
by police violence or do riots happen

00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,419
because protesters get violent or do

00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:19,780
riots happen because riders are angry

00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:23,599
about injustice well depending on which

00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:26,150
explanation you choose that will change

00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:27,820
what approach you take to solving the

00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:31,430
problem

00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:32,690
so the planner doesn't have a right to

00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:34,280
be wrong but the planner is almost

00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:36,530
guaranteed to be wrong to move back to

00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,630
coronavirus every mistake costs lives

00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:40,370
and even good decisions are going to end

00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:42,800
up costing lives and there's no way to

00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:44,150
go back and say that you did the right

00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,139
thing because you can't go back and try

00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:47,139
a different thing in compare

00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:53,210
so how do we as computer scientists and

00:06:51,169 --> 00:06:56,300
programmers typically solve problems

00:06:53,210 --> 00:07:00,320
well the first thing we do is we try to

00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:02,900
create a clear definition we break

00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:05,450
problems into their component pieces or

00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:06,740
we perform root-cause analysis we find

00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:08,270
the problem and we look for a problem

00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,620
that caused that problem and we look for

00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:13,850
another problem that caused it the

00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:18,560
second problem well these are good

00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:20,300
approaches for for partial problems but

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,060
they're not sufficient for wicked

00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:26,479
problems so we just determined that a

00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:29,120
clear definition of the problem might

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,460
not help us actually understand the

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,960
problem because there might be multiple

00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:35,630
contradictory equally valid clear

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,400
definitions breaking the problem into

00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:41,240
its component pieces might not actually

00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,680
be possible and following root causes

00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,030
might bring you right back to the

00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:49,270
beginning because problems caused

00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:51,770
themselves with wicked problems so

00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:53,870
wicked problems can't be solved with

00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:57,020
these steps what we need is a nonlinear

00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:59,000
approach and fortunately we already have

00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:01,400
people practitioners in our community

00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,100
who do do nonlinear approaches those are

00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:08,810
our designers Design Thinking is a

00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:10,340
nonlinear process designers have to gain

00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:11,810
a deep knowledge of their community

00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,210
rather than a superficial knowledge of

00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:16,250
the problems designers need to develop

00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:18,200
meaningful relationships with the

00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,750
stakeholders or even be the stakeholders

00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:23,570
themselves designers must remain

00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,450
accountable for their project and they

00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:28,430
must deal with very large timescales and

00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:31,250
designers it was in a social

00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:37,130
entrepreneurship need to focus on depth

00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:38,599
over the impact of breaths so just to

00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,950
give a couple of other examples of

00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:41,510
wicked problems that we're not going to

00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:43,250
dive too deep into but that might help

00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:45,920
you understand what do we the problem is

00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:48,380
global hunger is an example of a wicked

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,959
problem diversity in the STEM fields is

00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:53,300
an example of a wicked problem police

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,070
brutality is an example of a wicked

00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,260
problem in global warming is an example

00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:58,620
idiot problem and if you're interested

00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,080
in looking at ways

00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:03,000
approaches sort of generalize approaches

00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,380
to to solving these wicked problems you

00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
might be interested in reading a book

00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:11,330
called switch how to change when change

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:15,120
is hard by chippies this is a side note

00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:17,760
so this all sounds very depressing and

00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,870
very negative one of the things that is

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,600
suggested in the book that I just

00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,430
mentioned switch is that rather than

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,490
look at the bad parts we look at what's

00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:28,920
working we look at we look for bright

00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:30,570
spots areas in which we seem to be doing

00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,500
better than in other areas so let's do

00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:35,030
that let's look at where we're

00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:37,050
succeeding against ferony fires well

00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:38,940
berlin buzzwords it seemed appropriate

00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:42,810
to bring up that Germany is doing very

00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:44,250
well now it's not perfect we don't have

00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:46,920
zero cases and they don't have zero

00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,570
deaths but given the degree to which

00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,040
Germany is networked with the world this

00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,470
is actually a pretty good result

00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:56,490
with a population of 80 million Germany

00:09:52,470 --> 00:10:00,210
has had 186 thousand cases 8.8 thousand

00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:02,330
deaths the death rate for infected

00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:07,310
people has been very very low and

00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:11,420
Germany has managed to start stopping

00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:11,420
transmission within within its borders

00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:17,040
Finland has done extremely well they

00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:20,280
managed to keep the number of deaths

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,380
down to 323 now as for surrounding

00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,210
Finland and Germany are fundamentally

00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:26,280
different countries Finland has a much

00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:28,650
lower population density than Germany

00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:30,810
so the solutions that that apply in Finn

00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:34,920
that might not apply in Germany and the

00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:37,950
other way around as well New Zealand has

00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:40,110
had only 22 deaths and they just

00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:41,760
recently announced that they've got the

00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,290
number of cases on the island down to

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,440
zero so they're starting to open

00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:49,890
businesses back up this is a massive

00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,420
success Taiwan border with China which

00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:54,330
is the first place that the coronavirus

00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:56,460
broke out and they were confronted with

00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,810
making decisions before coronavirus was

00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,820
as well understood as some of these

00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:02,430
other places that I listed and yet

00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,950
despite that they managed heap the

00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:06,050
number of cases below a thousand and the

00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:11,240
number of deaths below

00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:13,250
now this is really really impressive so

00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,899
what is different about these places now

00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,910
we found our bright spots now we need to

00:11:14,899 --> 00:11:21,560
figure out what makes these spots bright

00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:23,630
spots so we've got Germany Finland New

00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,950
Zealand and Taiwan what is different

00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:28,940
about these places well let's look at

00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:30,680
who leads these places I'm Lila miracle

00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,600
I know miracle is shortly before her

00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,310
retirement in politics she was able to

00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,060
communicate the risks of pandemic very

00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:40,010
clearly to the population incredibly

00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:42,620
santamarina she's only 34 she's the

00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:44,720
youngest serving state leader and 12 of

00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:48,860
19 members of her 5 party cabinet or

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,720
women you send the ardor and shut the

00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:54,019
 the economy of Finland down

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:57,440
extremely early it was a risk-averse

00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:59,390
approach but it's brought New Zealand to

00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:03,200
a place where they can now fully reopen

00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:05,750
their economy and Sian Wayne used

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,510
testing and contact tracing very

00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:09,950
intensively and very quickly in order to

00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:11,540
control infections without a full

00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:13,190
national lockdown so those numbers that

00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,440
she managed to achieve were without a

00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:18,770
full national lockdown so if we look at

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,810
these spaces do we see a pattern is

00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:26,560
there something in common that these

00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:29,029
people show well yes they're all women

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,740
contrast this was Donald Trump who has

00:12:29,029 --> 00:12:32,450
chosen not to wear a mask because he

00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:34,700
wouldn't portray himself as strong

00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:36,680
enough that way or Boris Johnson who

00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,450
basically tried to negotiate with the

00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:42,800
virus and delayed lockdowns and other

00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:44,450
measures so does that mean that women

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,940
make better decisions is that what I'm

00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:52,070
trying to say well no that's not what

00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:53,540
I'm trying to say at all but it is worth

00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:55,279
noting that these are women maybe it's

00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:56,329
not the fact that these are that these

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,190
women are the leaders of these countries

00:12:56,329 --> 00:13:00,440
but rather the fact that these countries

00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:02,120
were willing to elect women that these

00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,589
were the best people for their roles in

00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,019
the countries where these countries were

00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:09,380
able to recognize that and put them into

00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:11,660
those roles these four women are

00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:13,399
stunningly capable and they were able to

00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,829
rise to the main leadership positions in

00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:16,990
their countries which doesn't just say

00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:18,160
good things about them

00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:21,880
also says good things about their

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:24,970
countries so what they manage to do is

00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:27,580
they they come from a society that

00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,770
values diversity uns and this is this is

00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:32,290
an important point because avoiding

00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:34,380
groupthink requires people with diverse

00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:37,000
backgrounds to have a seat at the table

00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:39,010
people need to feel safe bringing those

00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,720
diverse perspectives to the table people

00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:48,220
need to listen to and understand each

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:53,140
other's perspectives so diverse voices

00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:54,670
matter Angela Merkel's government for

00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:56,260
example considered a variety of

00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:59,080
different sources in developing its

00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:01,209
coronavirus policy so they included

00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,800
epidemiological models they concluded

00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:04,570
data for medical providers and they look

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,760
to South Korea for their successful

00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,080
programming of testing in isolation they

00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,380
were pulling in data from every

00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:12,790
direction they could find it remember we

00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:14,290
were saying that wicked problems our

00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:16,450
system problems with multiple

00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:18,339
interacting parts while working on these

00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:20,080
problems requires more expertise than a

00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:21,850
single person can bring to the table and

00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,800
putting multiple people with the same

00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:25,750
background and training at the table

00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:28,570
isn't much better than just putting one

00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:32,350
person at the table let's look at

00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:34,360
another example this right here is a

00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:38,370
picture of one of the engines of Qantas

00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:41,440
flight 32 this is really massive the

00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:43,000
engine exploded in the air the debris is

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,810
hit the left wing and knocked out

00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,959
multiple other systems and but you see

00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:51,850
this thing landed the crew managed to

00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:54,670
land the plane safely so a group of

00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:56,589
researchers closely examined the major

00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:58,990
does airline disasters and crew training

00:14:56,589 --> 00:15:02,050
and they examines the crisis

00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:03,880
communication performed between the crew

00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:05,620
members while solving these complex

00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,260
problems with hundreds of lives of a

00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:09,970
line under extreme high pressure the

00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,860
researchers were especially interested

00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:16,120
in those cases in which clearly the the

00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:18,550
plane was landed safely so when they

00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,500
examined those cases they found that the

00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:23,290
crews that succeeded at those things did

00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:25,420
two things right one thing the captain's

00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:26,400
style of communication had a major

00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:31,550
impact

00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:33,330
performance first the crews performed

00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:35,460
consistently better under intense

00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:36,800
temperature when the co-pilot was

00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:38,970
included in the decision-making process

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,310
that you would think well it's an

00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,810
emergency that the captain needs to know

00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:44,790
what to do and just tell everybody what

00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:46,560
to do and then people need to do it but

00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:48,240
that's not what's happening here when

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,870
the captain analyzed the problem alone

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,910
and simply gave orders the outcome was

00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:55,620
worse because these problems are complex

00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,540
and a single person can't understand

00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:00,150
even the pilot cannot understand the

00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:02,430
whole airplane so the seconds the

00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:04,470
captain's who asked open-ended questions

00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:06,480
that is how do you assess a situation

00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:08,940
what options do you see what do you

00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,470
suggest they ended up coming up with

00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:14,310
better solutions and captain's who

00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:15,300
simply ask yes or no questions so what

00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:18,030
they gathered here with these

00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:20,760
researchers gathered here was that when

00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:22,890
captain's included their colleagues of

00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:26,670
equal decision partners by asking them

00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:30,570
questions this is a form of leadership

00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:33,480
that IDI shine terms humble inquiry then

00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:35,940
that taps into other people's expertise

00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:41,400
and it aids them in bringing you

00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:43,470
constructive and factual information so

00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,510
societies which include diverse voices

00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:47,130
are already more likely to be teaching

00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:49,290
those values of listening careful

00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,700
decision making then societies which

00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:52,830
don't but there's also a reason to

00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,960
believe that women specifically are

00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:58,080
statistically better at this form of

00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:59,460
including multiple voices so research

00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,340
has shown that in high stakes situations

00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:04,680
men tend to become more risk-taking

00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:07,770
whereas women tend to look for smaller

00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:09,540
safer gains and the quality of team

00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:11,370
decision-making isn't determined by how

00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,740
smart a team's members are surprisingly

00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:15,600
the set is turned by how socially

00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:17,370
sensitive the members of the group are

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,440
and how well they are able to leverage

00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:21,630
the understanding and knowledge of the

00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,070
full group of people women are

00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:24,900
consistently more socially sensitive

00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:27,150
this doesn't mean they men can't learn

00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,010
it but statistically speaking women are

00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:31,410
consistently more social even sensitive

00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:33,420
and so researchers found the teams with

00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:36,300
more women tend to have a higher group

00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:39,810
IQ this is repeat this is a skill that

00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:43,270
men can learn neither stop the value

00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:45,190
so good leaders are not risk-takers they

00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:47,530
value inclusive decision-making they

00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:52,180
look to enable others and they practice

00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:54,310
humble inquiry and they're empathetic so

00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:56,080
coming back to the problem that we're

00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:59,380
trying this off here how are women in

00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,510
open-source combatant coronavirus so I'm

00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:03,790
going to get specific concrete here now

00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:05,200
I'm going to introduce four different

00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:07,090
women working on four different

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,000
initiatives two of them are smaller and

00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:11,590
more minor and solve a very localized

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,660
specific problem and two of them are

00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:18,960
working on larger longer term problems

00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:24,190
I'm going to start with sterling Peters

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:25,750
stormy is a leader in open source and

00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:28,240
when she realized that a lot of these

00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,900
conferences were failing or or being

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,880
cancelled

00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:33,790
fortunately Berlin buzzwords is doing

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,560
just fine she started an open-source

00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:37,810
hallway track she announced it on

00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:39,930
Twitter and communicated it effectively

00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:42,790
and leaders from all around the industry

00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:44,080
somewhere between 10 and 15 leaders

00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:45,280
every week have shown up at these

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,230
meetings and talked to each other about

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,210
various aspects of open source from

00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:51,250
diversity to open source programs

00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:53,590
offices to the relationship between open

00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:55,720
standards and open source code and

00:18:53,590 --> 00:19:02,830
people have enlightened each other and

00:18:55,720 --> 00:19:05,380
many people and networked itemo normally

00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:11,140
has worked on online trainings in Apache

00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:14,080
airflow Meredith Horowitz and a rather

00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:15,970
large team not not to forget the team

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,560
have worked and this isn't new thongs

00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:19,750
it's just something that's become pretty

00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:21,190
particularly relevant now have been

00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:23,770
working on a project called get your

00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:28,450
refund which lower-income people can get

00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:31,000
tax advice for free via a website and

00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:34,360
it's a project from Code for America so

00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,920
when the government brings out new

00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:40,450
government assistance related to

00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:42,640
coronavirus then the poor people at whom

00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:48,130
it is targeted are now more able to get

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:50,020
those refunds via via this project so

00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:53,650
the last project I want to talk to you

00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:54,400
about I have invited somebody to talk to

00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,650
you about it

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,970
um her name is Claire barn horn now

00:19:56,650 --> 00:20:00,100
Claire barn learn is working on a

00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:02,410
project called Sol hose and she's been

00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:05,440
working on this for most of the last

00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:07,570
year and a half so she was started to

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,690
work on it well before anybody knew

00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:12,790
anything about coronavirus claire has

00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:15,970
been interested in humanitarian aid all

00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:18,190
of her life she has she studied it she's

00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:20,890
worked in the field she's worked on the

00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:23,320
ground working for example setting up a

00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:24,390
field hospital in in condo work for

00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:28,120
Doctors Without Borders

00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:32,350
and in the process of doing that work

00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:34,120
claire noticed that procurement was a

00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:37,750
problem for these humanitarian

00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:39,490
organizations so a procurement officer

00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,950
who didn't know much about the space

00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:44,500
would then go and do a lot of searching

00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:45,700
to find for example an incubator and

00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,860
then buy the incubator but made me

00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:51,880
forget that she needs to account for

00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:53,530
spare parts and for training or the

00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:56,410
procurement officer might go to a

00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:57,700
contractor and ask the contractor for

00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:59,590
advice on how to do this in the

00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:01,540
contractor charges lots of money for

00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:04,000
something that he or she just did just

00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:06,910
to for the the last organization just a

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,880
few days ago which means that the the

00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:11,830
contractors get make a lot of money and

00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:14,530
it's an inefficient process and clear

00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:17,020
decided that she could see a way to

00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:19,300
solve that and she started working on a

00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:21,910
project called sofas which should solve

00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:23,290
that I'm hoping that we can add Claire

00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:30,420
to the stream now and we can start

00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:34,870
asking her about this solution hello hi

00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:37,270
nice to see you good thanks for the

00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:42,430
introduction so can I ask you a couple

00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:44,440
of questions absolutely excellent so

00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:47,530
first off can you tell me how you got

00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:49,390
interested in humanitarian aid that

00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:52,180
started and then everybody can guess my

00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:54,220
age in 1986 during the great famine in

00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,080
Ethiopia and I was six years old and it

00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:57,970
was his charity run at my high school of

00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,980
Ed my primary school I was a first

00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:03,280
grader and I came home running telling

00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:04,509
my dad and mum that Ethiopia were hungry

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,519
I wasn't even know

00:22:04,509 --> 00:22:08,559
to saying it was actually country but I

00:22:06,519 --> 00:22:09,940
was just determined to run the charity

00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,399
around so these two boys would not be

00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:14,589
hungry any longer and that's basically

00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:19,359
where I started and never never left

00:22:14,589 --> 00:22:21,729
business so would you tell me a little

00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:24,099
bit more about your background as well

00:22:21,729 --> 00:22:26,109
you mentioned that you had been involved

00:22:24,099 --> 00:22:29,079
in procurements how did you get into

00:22:26,109 --> 00:22:30,639
that so I started studying tropical

00:22:29,079 --> 00:22:32,320
agriculture at first at Wageningen

00:22:30,639 --> 00:22:34,209
University in the Netherlands and I

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,509
became a master in disaster eventually I

00:22:34,209 --> 00:22:39,279
did my masters in disaster studies

00:22:36,509 --> 00:22:41,469
started to work in India started to do

00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:45,309
another master's in Unitarian systems in

00:22:41,469 --> 00:22:46,989
Dublin University and then I start

00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:49,440
working with Doctors Without Borders and

00:22:46,989 --> 00:22:52,059
that's what I did for many years and

00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,969
actually in 2010 I was in the Congo

00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:57,849
realizing that just due to the fact that

00:22:54,969 --> 00:23:01,209
was collecting data on malnutrition

00:22:57,849 --> 00:23:02,829
rates and I came into a situation or

00:23:01,209 --> 00:23:04,479
people telling me that action console of

00:23:02,829 --> 00:23:06,519
files and other organization was doing

00:23:04,479 --> 00:23:10,079
the exact same things five or seven

00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:12,669
years ago so my data was just a time

00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:14,589
just that's at that moment in time I

00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:17,469
knew something but at this day that

00:23:14,589 --> 00:23:19,749
didn't it didn't tell me anything on is

00:23:17,469 --> 00:23:21,819
it better or worse is it epidemic is

00:23:19,749 --> 00:23:24,129
what's the data telling me more than

00:23:21,819 --> 00:23:25,839
just these numbers so debts drove me

00:23:24,129 --> 00:23:27,729
into data-driven innovation and

00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:31,779
technology in the Unitarian sector and

00:23:27,729 --> 00:23:34,749
that has led me eventually to be more

00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:38,759
involved in innovation where I saw a lot

00:23:34,749 --> 00:23:41,619
of duplication help opening up a lot of

00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:43,359
yet for example clean cooking stoves

00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:44,889
there's even a website on innovative

00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:48,309
clean cooking stoves and it has more

00:23:44,889 --> 00:23:50,739
than 250 different innovative solutions

00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:53,139
but it's basically all comes down to the

00:23:50,739 --> 00:23:55,509
same solution same innovation so there

00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:57,669
was just a lot of duplication the same

00:23:55,509 --> 00:24:00,369
time I've seen amazing innovations and

00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:01,989
they're just chasing one eight agency

00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:04,089
after the other trying to find a use

00:24:01,989 --> 00:24:06,429
case they could actually provide value

00:24:04,089 --> 00:24:08,259
to and I thought discs we can do more

00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:10,659
systematically and we need a system

00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:14,200
change in a sector and if we'd like to

00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:15,969
open up the sector for innovations we

00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,099
have to start looking at procurement and

00:24:15,969 --> 00:24:18,460
that's why the procurement cycle came

00:24:18,099 --> 00:24:20,350
into it

00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:22,270
system came into the spots and that's

00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:25,450
where actually our system approach is

00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:27,400
now focusing on so in procurement you

00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:30,130
mentioned that you've got a lot of

00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:32,590
people bringing in products is that the

00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:34,840
right approach is that how we're likely

00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:36,310
to solve these problems coming up with

00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:38,860
great new ideas and then trying to get

00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:41,410
them to the aid agencies currently a lot

00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:42,790
of that's that's common practice at the

00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:44,590
moment there's a lot of discussions on

00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:46,750
great innovations and how to scale

00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:49,390
innovation so there's tremendous amount

00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:52,060
of programs to scale innovations but if

00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:55,540
you don't present them in the community

00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:57,460
or in this sector eight sector for

00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:59,500
humanitarian development agencies these

00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:02,020
are the existing solutions it's so hard

00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:05,260
to read them a to see what's the value

00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:07,210
of it or how to even notice about them

00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:09,700
if you're not at that same conference or

00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:11,260
not being introduced at the right moment

00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:15,580
so that's what we're doing we're trying

00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:19,330
to make that systemic and open up these

00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:20,470
systematically so how how do innovators

00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:22,780
become aware

00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:24,490
sorry how do you commit well yeah I know

00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:26,740
innovators become aware of the problems

00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:29,020
that they need to solve so what we're

00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:31,660
having is basically a search engine an

00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:33,550
open source catalog we call it an open

00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:35,170
access catalog because knowledge is for

00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:37,270
the Commons knowledge should be for

00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:38,920
everybody and what we're doing if you

00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:40,600
type in I need a generator because

00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:43,210
you're building an outpatient clinic in

00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,590
Uganda for example you don't get search

00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:47,200
you can search it and do you needed

00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:49,930
product generator or do you need a power

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:53,110
supply which is the identified need of

00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:56,470
the keywords and then we go back and try

00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:59,170
to take the the user on a journey with

00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:01,780
us and we move away from Prada dominated

00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:04,150
thinking into solutions into what's the

00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:06,490
identified need that you're after so you

00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:08,080
need a power supply alright great

00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:09,610
we know it's a power supply what's the

00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,230
next step is that a community power

00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:13,570
supply a household power supply a

00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:15,250
facility power supply and if you drill

00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:18,670
down for example you need a community

00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:21,400
power supply the key requirements or the

00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:23,980
criteria on which you select your

00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,480
solution package is then coming up so

00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:28,000
that's where we work with a lot of

00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,800
experts in the field to open up this

00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,450
expertise so if it's a community power

00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,320
supply you will have questions what's

00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:34,330
the population

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:37,259
City what's the resource setting what's

00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:39,970
the need etc what's the peak load what's

00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:41,830
sun hours it's at all these little

00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:44,080
details and the more you fill in the

00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:46,269
more narrow your solution packages that

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,100
the platform will present you will be

00:26:46,269 --> 00:26:51,159
because it will be more matching to your

00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:53,019
requirements and I mean so you get

00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:55,299
complete solutions that means that the

00:26:53,019 --> 00:26:57,549
aid agencies can also see what the total

00:26:55,299 --> 00:26:58,870
hosta is not just what the cost of that

00:26:57,549 --> 00:27:01,330
one piece of equipment is there anything

00:26:58,870 --> 00:27:04,480
here yes exactly so a solution package

00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:06,159
we are after responsible procurement we

00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,320
started with responsible innovation what

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,500
it's now responsible procurement exactly

00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:12,929
the example you gave if you're after

00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:15,669
reducing the rate of mortality of

00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:17,769
children after childbirth an incubator

00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:20,019
is exactly what you're after but an

00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:22,299
incubator alone is not this is not a

00:27:20,019 --> 00:27:23,919
responsible solution package with that

00:27:22,299 --> 00:27:26,470
comes the assurance there's enough power

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:28,059
available for the next five years with

00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:30,039
that comes a service a maintenance

00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:32,740
contract for five years because the

00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:35,080
lifespan is set as a five year force

00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:36,909
such an incubator with that comes a

00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:39,759
spare part kit with that comes a

00:27:36,909 --> 00:27:42,580
training of nurses and if an agency has

00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:45,009
one or multiple already available of

00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:47,289
in-house they just uncheck that box and

00:27:45,009 --> 00:27:49,539
they can sale it at solution packages

00:27:47,289 --> 00:27:51,220
but you at least know what's what needs

00:27:49,539 --> 00:27:53,590
to be in that solution package and

00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,840
there's also the pre requirements so we

00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:57,519
assume that the pre requirement for an

00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,649
incubator is that there is enough power

00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:02,769
available and this is the standard of

00:27:59,649 --> 00:28:05,590
the power uninterupted obviously for an

00:28:02,769 --> 00:28:07,210
incubator and if you don't have that you

00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:08,950
just stick it and you go down the stream

00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:11,139
again you would just add that to your

00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:15,370
specific solution package for your

00:28:11,139 --> 00:28:19,059
clinic in Uganda okay so the coronavirus

00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:21,100
make this harder yeah actually it made

00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:22,870
it more visible so we have done an

00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:24,399
analysis of all the major pitfalls that

00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:26,470
were addressing so I really mentioned

00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:28,570
product dominated thinking we often have

00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:31,029
a poor knowledge on how local solutions

00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:33,490
work at field level or there's no

00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:35,830
visibility of a local solution so we

00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:37,779
have all these major pitfalls but

00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:40,929
actually came a few that actually made

00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:43,419
things worse in in in Africa for example

00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:45,700
so complete supply chains already

00:28:43,419 --> 00:28:46,210
collapsing here in I'm from the

00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,550
Netherlands

00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:50,860
moment that's where I'm based now so

00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:52,630
supply chains already collapsing here

00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:55,390
for businesses so imagine what it will

00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:57,610
be for the 8th sector and also the

00:28:55,390 --> 00:29:00,130
supply chains are predominantly EU and

00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:02,070
us centric and they are collapsing so we

00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:05,680
have to invest in more localized

00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:07,600
abilities to procure so our platform

00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:10,450
made it even moon it was even more

00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,490
necessary to move fast and speedy to

00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:14,980
open up and there's also a lot of

00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:16,960
competition and then talking here it is

00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:22,780
all where everybody's working on open

00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:25,360
source there is this whole new sector

00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:26,980
that actually joined to support those in

00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:29,950
need and the respondents in the

00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:32,050
coronavirus crisis is is makers

00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:35,170
community there's I've seen amazing

00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:37,240
open-source designs the the 3d printing

00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:39,100
community just they exploded they all

00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:42,760
start working together but these designs

00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:44,110
is very hard to flow into the 8th sector

00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,760
and that's also what retraining

00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:47,920
incorporate the solution package is a

00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,590
combination of services designs and

00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:53,350
products so also these open-source

00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:55,870
designs can just create value not only

00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:59,140
in your own community but far and far

00:29:55,870 --> 00:30:00,910
beyond so how is that so those are open

00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,960
source design to disseminating or there

00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:06,160
are other ways in which the work you're

00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:07,690
doing is open source yes so there's an

00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,940
not a lot of people know that but

00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:12,850
there's 10 million NGOs globally there's

00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:14,380
1 million in India but still 9 million

00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:16,000
on all the other countries in the world

00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:19,090
and they all do their own procurement

00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,060
and it's all having their own language

00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:24,100
and when you're in data you know that

00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:25,900
you have to have common semantics you

00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:27,400
have to know that you compare apples

00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,960
with apples and know the apples with

00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,660
peers at least you know we're talking

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,600
about so we are providing and creating

00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:36,400
now open standards and semantics that

00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,170
can be shared within the sector so we

00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,510
can combine everything and link

00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:42,760
everything and creating open standards

00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:46,900
for procurement and open standards for

00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:49,120
our knowledgebase and similarly the the

00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:52,090
solutions catalog as we call it so it's

00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,120
merged with a tender platform I didn't

00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:56,470
mention that part yet but the OPA

00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:58,000
catalog of all these solutions and the

00:30:56,470 --> 00:31:00,070
search base it's all open access

00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,059
knowledge

00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:06,149
okay so it can open source software make

00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:08,169
your working more impactful in any way

00:31:06,149 --> 00:31:09,820
obviously in the future

00:31:08,169 --> 00:31:12,309
that's something it's high on our wish

00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:14,859
list we have released for us things have

00:31:12,309 --> 00:31:17,769
moved so fast because of the coronavirus

00:31:14,859 --> 00:31:20,320
and we released a prototype in March

00:31:17,769 --> 00:31:21,999
20th and immediately that weekend our

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,220
whole community got together to actually

00:31:21,999 --> 00:31:26,619
start making providing value for the

00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:30,570
current prices we're in so the speed

00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:33,549
that we are with prevented us to do the

00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:35,830
our preferred scenario so we're now

00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:38,169
launching end of this summer and then

00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:41,169
we're looking into rewriting and then

00:31:38,169 --> 00:31:45,429
making continuing on an open source

00:31:41,169 --> 00:31:47,759
coding a stream okay so this is this is

00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:50,830
very very interesting but I'm going to

00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:53,519
stop our conversation here so that

00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:58,059
people have a chance to ask questions so

00:31:53,519 --> 00:32:00,639
Nicole asked you mentioned that a patch

00:31:58,059 --> 00:32:02,919
with interact-as Humana is a

00:32:00,639 --> 00:32:04,389
humanitarian project can you say

00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:06,849
something about its origin and motive

00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:11,049
and are there other Apache projects with

00:32:06,849 --> 00:32:13,389
a similar idea or purpose um so fin act

00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:16,690
comes from the Grameen foundation

00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:20,129
originally the Grameen foundation for

00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:22,960
those who don't know does humanity this

00:32:20,129 --> 00:32:26,739
microfinance that is this idea that if

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,749
you give people little tiny loans to

00:32:26,739 --> 00:32:30,249
invest in their businesses they can pay

00:32:28,749 --> 00:32:34,779
them back and you can keep using that

00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:36,580
capital so this requires it's basically

00:32:34,779 --> 00:32:38,080
creating banking solutions for

00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:40,720
communities that didn't have them before

00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:42,999
that so the Grammy Foundation started

00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,200
creating these first the Grameen Bank

00:32:42,999 --> 00:32:45,999
then the Grameen foundation started

00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,789
creating these these little local banks

00:32:45,999 --> 00:32:51,609
that called microfinance Institute's

00:32:47,789 --> 00:32:54,489
institutions and the person we're

00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:57,070
tracking stuff on paper with pencil and

00:32:54,489 --> 00:32:59,529
that's difficult then they were doing

00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:01,960
stuff with Excel and then they started

00:32:59,529 --> 00:33:04,779
working on an open source banking

00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:08,139
solution and that banking solution was

00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:09,669
originally called me post it was that

00:33:08,139 --> 00:33:10,210
the me post initiative was spun out of

00:33:09,669 --> 00:33:12,910
the Graeme

00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:15,460
nation and the meatless initiative

00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:17,230
donated the back end of that project to

00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:22,870
Apache and that's what Apache interact

00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:24,340
is so the thus origin the project that

00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:28,630
the motivation of the project is to make

00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:29,980
it possible cheaper to offer banking

00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:32,290
solutions to people who did not

00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:33,910
previously have them and those there are

00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:35,850
two billion people in the world who are

00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:38,290
unbanked or underbanked

00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:41,230
are there other Apache projects with a

00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:42,940
similar idea of purpose most Apache

00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:46,230
projects are fairly commercially

00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:48,730
oriented and most effective projects are

00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:50,980
less than complete projects and more

00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:55,600
like libraries or components that work

00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:57,580
with other components but I'd say yeah I

00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:01,480
mean OpenOffice has similarities because

00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:03,460
it made it possible for people to access

00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,010
their their office document formats

00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:08,950
whether they could afford Microsoft

00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:10,540
software or not but in general no I

00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:12,670
don't think there is another project at

00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:13,990
Apache that's that has similar that

00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:15,280
that's similar but the projects at

00:34:13,990 --> 00:34:19,060
Apache are very different from each

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,950
other as well thank you very much thank

00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:22,750
you Claire for joining for joining me

00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:25,780
for this is this really interesting

00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:27,810
conversation Solo's I think has a huge

00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:31,330
amount of potential and I think also

00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:33,610
that we have a lot of different people

00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:35,320
working on the problem coronavirus and

00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:37,000
humanitarian aid in general and if we

00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:39,570
just we keep recognizing the

00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,620
difficulties of the problem and

00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:42,970
recognising the importance of different

00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:47,020
perspectives that different people bring

00:34:42,970 --> 00:34:50,950
to it that we have a real chance of
