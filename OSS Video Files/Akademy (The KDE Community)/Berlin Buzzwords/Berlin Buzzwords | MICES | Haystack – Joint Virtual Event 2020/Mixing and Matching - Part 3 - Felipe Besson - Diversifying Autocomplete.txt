Title: Mixing and Matching - Part 3 - Felipe Besson - Diversifying Autocomplete
Publication date: 2020-07-02
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords | MICES | Haystack â€“ Joint Virtual Event 2020
Description: 
	More: https://berlinbuzzwords.de/session/mixing-and-matching-diversifying-search-results

Imagine a shopper searches for "coffee". The search results mindlessly repeat brand name, ground coffee over and over. Technically relevant. But not very useful. Not mixed in are results appealing to a different kind of "coffee" searcher:  organic coffee, whole bean, espresso, or related coffee equipment. 

Beyond relevant results is Result Set Diversity: providing not just technically correct answers, but a diverse (though still relevant) view of what's possible in the search system. Showing our grocery searcher that we might, after all, have something they want.

In this panel, we'll discuss Result Set Diversity in search. We'll hear from teams working to summarize for users the diverse array of options available to them given their query. An ideal search experience helps provide next steps, broaden the user's understanding of the content related to keywords, and cover the user's possible, unspoken intent.

Join host Doug Turnbull and search practitioners, Andreas Wagner, Felipe Besson, and Lev Gershenzon, as we hear experiences measuring & solving Results Diversity, with a panel discussion on the Result Search Diversity problem.

I'll be talking about diverse

00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:15,980
I might go issue go through discuss some

00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:20,570
techniques to diversify search results

00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:23,840
well bring them in early stage in the

00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:26,029
ultimate I also be sharing a real-life

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,640
project that I had a chance to work and

00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:32,900
apply those techniques and also be

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:38,660
sharing some results alive straight talk

00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:40,820
about flex group to the company work we

00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:43,420
are big group like more than 20 brains

00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:46,910
classified brains world wild the numbers

00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:48,859
think so by themselves and I work

00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:52,219
particularly in this brand

00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:54,320
OLX which one that brains inside group

00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:57,530
and the online classifieds

00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,260
some people calls also adds platform in

00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:04,309
more than 25 countries and don't you

00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:09,260
start my my talk I'd like to share about

00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:12,470
like how is the OLX rope discovery cycle

00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:16,850
how do we do it hope user in the

00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:18,650
discovery cycle we start everything some

00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,960
a times with a homepage and have a

00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:22,580
search box where you can head out

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,130
complete can pick or not to suggest

00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:27,770
offer up the outcome please go to a

00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:30,320
search page and you have like listings

00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:32,740
with this in our case they are ads if

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,300
you click on an ad to go to our add page

00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:37,760
we have some recommendations of bar of

00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:39,860
the page and all those steps are its

00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,290
interactions and then you can use

00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,660
doesn't actually push content to the

00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:49,040
user for example in the home feed on the

00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:50,410
home page all those steps are very

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,630
interconnected

00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:56,240
right but users has different things

00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:59,930
it's not a problem problem only for OLX

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,280
but in commerce feature arrow and what

00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:03,170
would break this dialogue with the user

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,790
if it is a conversation that are heavy

00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:07,250
what can break its conversation and

00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:11,980
broad queries can break the out complete

00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:14,510
and search as well explained in his talk

00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,920
big which can burn understand bad

00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:18,980
interactions can break recommendations

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,660
and one of the things we believe and we

00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,569
will discuss the panels that diverse

00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:27,129
fine search results can

00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:28,359
strength the dialogue with refuser when

00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:30,549
dealing with blood Claire is not

00:02:28,359 --> 00:02:32,560
competent search when you have like a

00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:34,450
shock a showcase you will show your

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,030
items you need for new and Explorer

00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:39,400
users also to guaran capturing more

00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:41,680
information for improved recommendations

00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,420
and my talk about a focus on this

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,150
problem of dealing with rod Pettis in

00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:49,120
the autumn plate so that's the agenda

00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:50,680
that's one a big cover it we are going

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,530
to discuss later beats the broad class

00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,849
problem in the out complete balanced

00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:59,079
custom techniques to promote

00:02:54,849 --> 00:03:00,669
diversification and this is the core of

00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:03,219
the talk we can say and we are going to

00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:06,669
have support for this use case they

00:03:03,219 --> 00:03:07,299
autocomplete at OLX Europe so let's get

00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:10,719
started

00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:14,680
I think everybody knows on what is the

00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:17,680
not complete type-ahead feature but I

00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,379
would like to highlight that I consider

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,290
there are only tattoo to talk directly

00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:25,719
to the user and sometimes is the first

00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:29,169
point of contact the user has of our

00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:30,849
search express and what is important

00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:32,470
because the guide users who good queries

00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:34,900
it help the quite understand through

00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:37,900
quiz list and better it helps this like

00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:41,229
face responsive reaction and if you do

00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:43,620
these three things very well I think you

00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:48,430
help you tackling search relevance early

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:49,150
early as possible let's see and what is

00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,419
the autocomplete

00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:54,129
at how is that completed Oleg's our use

00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:57,310
case that are going to be using to

00:03:54,129 --> 00:04:01,000
explain everything so we suggest popular

00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:04,659
search queries with catechist only we

00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,370
kind of have a popularity her recipe

00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:10,750
similar to the one that Peter showing

00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:12,459
his nice talk today with covers we are

00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:14,859
not only suggest the popular points but

00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:17,169
also category filter if someone a user

00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:19,409
pick that that's that category

00:04:17,169 --> 00:04:22,810
suggestion that go to a search page

00:04:19,409 --> 00:04:25,870
trained by that category filter we are

00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:28,599
we also receive more than 50,000 million

00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:31,870
requests per day so it's a very

00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:34,090
impressive number with over 40% of total

00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,400
search and the ranks just palpable

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,960
narrowness narrowness here is that

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:41,500
have the chance to push for a more

00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:45,090
precise category we do it sometimes most

00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:48,100
of the case looks good but we have this

00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:49,930
traditional but well-known Road query

00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,810
problem right let's say let us think

00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:55,509
about a Vespa ice puter motorcycle

00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,430
notice her changing and I voted out

00:04:55,509 --> 00:04:59,949
completely I have this universe of

00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:04,090
scooters in my mind and what actually

00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:06,160
what is my intent when it happens what

00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:09,930
if I have of this power and wants an

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:13,510
accessory but I can help it

00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:15,690
what if I don't know anything about like

00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:20,430
anything about models am I ready for

00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:24,460
clicking one of these models another

00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:26,889
Broadway effect so this is an example

00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:30,340
the user close and search for Gucci

00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:33,849
fashion brand it's very common in out

00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:36,849
complete we receive requests to for

00:05:33,849 --> 00:05:39,280
brands and if I get all the results that

00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:40,690
they can return when I go through Alex

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,510
and type of Gucci

00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:44,680
I wanna get and I get the categories of

00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,320
those results I'm gonna get this

00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:50,050
category hierarchy key I have a level

00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:54,550
one category fashion a level two

00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:57,330
category with default opt and I have a

00:05:54,550 --> 00:06:01,150
level three with more specific stuff

00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:03,490
like sunglasses wallets handbags order

00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:06,460
bags and accessories ma'am and food were

00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:08,139
and what if suggested a is like what is

00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:10,419
inside this box which is very relevant

00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:13,510
but look at how many things we could

00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:18,010
have suggested should you consider this

00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:22,060
both examples we have some breaks in our

00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:24,580
dialogue with user maybe we jump a to

00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,620
premature conclusions show very specific

00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:29,949
popular suggestions in case of Vespa

00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:33,159
models maybe we could have asked more

00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:37,539
maybe shows more possibilities to to

00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:40,630
autocomplete like accessories we could

00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:43,210
like but as the problem may be we never

00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:45,840
have the chest rest more because you

00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:48,520
have this popularity feedback loop we

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,930
suggest things that are popular new

00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,580
content or

00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:53,470
that are not too popular we don't

00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:56,350
suggest so these things never get

00:06:53,470 --> 00:07:03,220
popular right so is the famous rich get

00:06:56,350 --> 00:07:04,630
richer and diversify Alton pleat we

00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,979
believe that can improve the user

00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:09,009
experience on those broad queries

00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:11,770
because with that we can minimize the

00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:13,690
over over specialization of some

00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:15,340
suggestions like give an overview of

00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:18,699
different available item categories

00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:21,729
break this feedback loop and we find the

00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:23,830
user query may be showing all user I

00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:27,490
think that possible will happens refine

00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:32,289
the query so let's have a bet in mind

00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:33,699
let's formalize our or Bowl in this

00:07:32,289 --> 00:07:35,860
experiment it is like a real-life

00:07:33,699 --> 00:07:38,949
project what I wanted is diversify out

00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:41,380
complete category suggestions for broad

00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:43,750
place abroad query is like what level

00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:46,479
explain something that can explain it I

00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:48,430
can have me mud or minis multiplications

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,400
when our case is something that's also

00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:53,320
popular want you want to expand out

00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,180
completely we want you also a change

00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,039
where is that like the head quality they

00:07:55,180 --> 00:08:00,220
have interaction did brings traffic to

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,260
our website and those queries has two

00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:04,120
content categories many search results

00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:06,330
we don't want to put a new suggestion

00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,880
with a kettlebell that maybe shows like

00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:13,449
one percent of the room set and those

00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:17,560
categories are not yet suggested okay so

00:08:13,449 --> 00:08:19,240
how to apply diversification I think it

00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,720
is like one of the fifth at disappearing

00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,949
is about my goal here is not like go

00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,400
through this question answer this

00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:29,800
question only share some with purchase

00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:34,089
some techniques that they I use it in

00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:35,770
this user case and inspired from web

00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:38,229
search information retrieval there was a

00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:40,419
nice paper from professor sense about

00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:43,510
this that was talking called explicit

00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:47,560
diversification in web search it happens

00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:50,170
when you have a I avoid a query or also

00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,690
know as the information needs and the

00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:54,160
squares has moto interpretations and you

00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,959
explicit diversify

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,829
you your voice to increase the coverage

00:08:55,959 --> 00:09:01,290
cover as many as possible

00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:04,240
interpretations left mini that we can do

00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:07,460
this is very good for broad

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:11,750
but the next question is how can we

00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:15,020
measure coverage again it's like not an

00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:17,090
answer is like a metal polish that I see

00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:19,250
that's very common why buy based on the

00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:23,260
blog post isn't research today I

00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:27,680
followed and the choose Pat methodology

00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:32,860
before I start very simple but if you

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:36,020
clear your documents into topics right

00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:37,940
tops here can we face these aggregations

00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:41,060
category scholars who are doing bad news

00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:43,010
vectors and the moment you do that you

00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,810
have something like on the left here you

00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:47,390
have the top then you put the top

00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:48,710
undecided topic I'm assuming here that I

00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:50,840
don't have overlapping like you want

00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:54,140
document it locked me to belong so only

00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:56,360
through one talk but when you do that

00:09:54,140 --> 00:10:02,240
the moment you have this you can also

00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:05,150
derive our distribution you when you do

00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,250
they have visit it of like you in this

00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:10,250
case you are more likely to return your

00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:14,060
result set a blue topic it in a great

00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:15,770
opera so the quote the second step is

00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:17,090
like measure dispersion of the stop

00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:18,710
distribution because you can have

00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:20,410
multiple solutions if you have something

00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:22,790
on the left

00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:25,070
you know what's return but if you have

00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:27,140
something more on the right you have a

00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:29,450
better chance to return like a different

00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:32,330
talks but how do you if you were in the

00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:35,000
left or in the right that was tools for

00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:37,460
doing that like Gini coefficient for

00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,200
example that program he but a dog has a

00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,960
nice heart bodies for e-commerce

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,000
Shanno entropy which today was very well

00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:47,210
introduced attorneys they're amazing

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:52,640
talk like from yet row and Byron and I

00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:55,910
wanna only reveal the top Shanno entropy

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,770
most of you guys know measures the level

00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:00,380
of information in a probability

00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:02,720
distribution so we have a distribution

00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:05,270
random variable distributions here three

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,510
distributions and let's say that the

00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:11,330
event is like peak of a sweet fruit from

00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:13,670
distribution so in this portion way if

00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:15,440
you randomly pick any any many times you

00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:17,240
want a fruit from the distribution you

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,250
always get lettuce

00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:20,930
that limo is not sweet you have high

00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:23,450
knowledge about that you never get like

00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:26,570
a sweet fruit distribution a so you can

00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:30,290
say that have no super nice but if you

00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:33,320
go should be you have 75% of chances to

00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:37,399
picking lemon and 25% of chance of

00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:40,100
beating orange it's better right and see

00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:44,300
you have 50% of big chance of picking

00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:46,970
lemon 25 origin 25% of speaking very

00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:50,060
sweet strawberry so you can say that in

00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:52,580
C you have hi hi hi surprised or higher

00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:56,060
uncertainty and some people as some

00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:58,459
people say but the question is how to

00:11:56,060 --> 00:12:02,270
quantify how to put a number on this

00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:04,790
like suprise and that when aware hello

00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:06,940
entropy comes to play this is the

00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:10,730
formula for a mood class channel entropy

00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:12,140
it's very simple we have this P of Y was

00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,570
the probability of event that will

00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:17,360
happen for example in C if you do that

00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:19,100
apply this formula we have like this 25

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,480
percent of chance of picking strawberry

00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,579
and then you do the calculation for all

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,940
the events that happen and I have

00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:28,910
entropy of 1.5 so higher the entropy

00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:33,680
higher this level of uncertainty or

00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:36,680
diversity in the distribution and how to

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,529
do that for e-commerce ease this is like

00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:43,820
exactly what like a a Trotter mission in

00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:45,649
barroom in there talk about methodology

00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:47,839
you can have some category probability

00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:50,120
so as the moment you cross the road of

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,529
me it's in any criteria here let's

00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:53,899
assume that the clustering categories

00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:56,329
you can have a category probability

00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:58,610
which like basically get all the results

00:12:56,329 --> 00:13:00,440
that you have in your result set and

00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:02,450
then you get like how many results falls

00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,480
in in certain category and you have the

00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:07,790
probit of having that category for

00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:10,579
example if I both show OLX answers for

00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:12,709
blues I can have disks I can have cars

00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:15,560
this like the probability of having each

00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:18,649
of this category you can you can

00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:22,640
interpret this as bike while so bullets

00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:25,610
often return intention and and the

00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:29,730
intention is that like his video is cars

00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:32,490
computers and you have entropy but

00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:34,199
absolute number it makes sense if you

00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:36,899
compared to our distributions for

00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:39,449
example like if I search for blue Vespa

00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:42,350
on hundred twenty twenty five I have a

00:13:39,449 --> 00:13:45,209
lower entropy it was most likely my

00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:47,790
intent that when a cover is like a

00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:51,959
motorcycle return a product a net energy

00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:56,279
that's a motorcycle or maybe some parts

00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:58,649
and accessories okay but we can take

00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:02,370
okhane view entropy from another

00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:05,310
perspective this example is a straight

00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:07,470
from this paper is very nice let's

00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:09,630
assume that now the exercises to have

00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:11,430
pockets and have letters and have three

00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:13,829
pockets and you know how to copulate now

00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:15,690
the entropy off the bucket and let's say

00:14:13,829 --> 00:14:17,670
that you randomly pick a letter from the

00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:20,339
bucket and the question is how many

00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:23,579
questions do any to ask to find out what

00:14:20,339 --> 00:14:25,740
error is a luxurious exploration here

00:14:23,579 --> 00:14:27,660
this game akinator I don't know how many

00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,519
of you guys know this game is very nice

00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:33,060
you think about a character of your life

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,490
character or not and this Genie is gonna

00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:37,709
find out we were think about it in I

00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:41,190
don't know ten questions and he was like

00:14:37,709 --> 00:14:42,180
the seasons entropy to prune the trees

00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:44,490
and find out the answer

00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:47,279
so here the question is simpler is like

00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:50,490
how many questions you have to ask and

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,170
Buckett one it's very clear we don't

00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:54,079
need to ask any questions a zero

00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:56,670
questions because you can always get a

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:59,639
well Alexis let's take a look at pocket

00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:02,819
three so this is our distribution and

00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:04,949
you can organize a decision tree as

00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:08,430
follow to minimize the number of

00:15:04,949 --> 00:15:12,540
questions you can make make so we can

00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:14,819
say is a or b and and and it's a you ask

00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:17,670
more questions be another question the

00:15:14,819 --> 00:15:20,639
same way for C or D so take a look you

00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:24,240
have two questions and never wish for

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:27,000
here but it letter has like a different

00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,160
probability of happening so if you isn't

00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,389
it to two questions for it later okay

00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,400
multiplied by the probability and you

00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:38,710
arrive in these two questions this

00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:43,280
the most diverse like distribution but

00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:46,160
buckets to still as diverse you can do

00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:48,650
better than two questions because we

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,690
have a chance of like returning a so you

00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:53,360
can even eyes a decision tree based on

00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:56,990
this effect so we can write already ask

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:59,390
is a one question if it's not a you can

00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:02,060
ask is be okay for picture questions and

00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:04,760
see you need NCR do need a third

00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:06,320
question by organizing our decision tree

00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,540
like this and multiply by the

00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:12,680
probability having it letter we have

00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:14,900
1.75 it's better than shoe so turns out

00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,600
that this number of questions exactly

00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:19,580
the value of the nature P so if we can't

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,620
repay like this how many effort had to

00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:24,590
put to know more about than my

00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,540
distribution tray but let's come back to

00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:28,340
the autocomplete so the question is on

00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:31,150
average how many questions can you ask

00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:35,120
to make sure you cover all user intents

00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:37,310
and that's assume that it's suggesting

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,810
we give it out complete is a question

00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:40,760
chemic is like we have a conversation

00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:41,480
the user is like you'd ruin this or

00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,600
these are bet

00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:47,000
so it suggestions on a question so if

00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,380
you have a very specific query maybe you

00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,370
don't even have a suggestion to make

00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:54,650
because it's low entropy like it only to

00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:58,430
ask the user wants that well four broad

00:16:54,650 --> 00:17:00,260
ways we can ask any questions but how

00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:03,770
many is any how can you define those

00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:05,990
questions only to have a picture and

00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:08,420
talk about it like is the autocomplete

00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:10,040
like it suggests a possible query we're

00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:12,410
going to calculate the entropy or fit

00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:15,440
category in that suggestions and any if

00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:16,580
you sum the entropy of each suggestions

00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,530
are going to have the total entropy

00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:20,959
which measures that they first of all

00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:24,980
complete with in our example how many

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:28,510
different questions can make but how to

00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:31,160
pick its suggestion that's a challenge

00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:33,770
let's watch it extreme first to try to

00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,270
understand this and extremely we can

00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:38,860
have ten different suggestions that have

00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:42,380
ten slots in this extremely scenario I

00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:43,700
have each category may be divides like

00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:47,150
my result set

00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,960
equally uniformly so it's it category

00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,570
does

00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:53,419
our product has the and it scattered

00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:54,799
we're a heliport of 10% cause his

00:17:53,419 --> 00:17:59,149
uniform and then you have a disease

00:17:54,799 --> 00:18:02,149
rupee 33 but let's take a look how

00:17:59,149 --> 00:18:06,230
entropy behaves so here in this chart

00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:08,809
displayed we have on axis axis like the

00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:11,840
probability of that or each category

00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:14,270
like and then why we have the entropy

00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:16,610
right so let's take a look at the

00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:17,929
stretch hose 10% what what is all those

00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:20,630
this means this means that I have a

00:18:17,929 --> 00:18:25,990
category and the scatter it covers 10%

00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:28,309
of my result set maybe to go to the left

00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:29,990
we don't want to include maybe decently

00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:31,669
in the autocomplete because it's too few

00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:33,320
results if you do user pick that

00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:35,419
suggestions unless is very important but

00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,610
is very important so editor you want to

00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:40,130
explain the route complete on the other

00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:42,860
hand something very very very specific

00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:45,409
verbally can be inserted warning one for

00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,240
one tenth one one category so we are

00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:49,399
talking about here narrow queries so

00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:51,770
maybe we don't want this so the key here

00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:57,529
is to pick something this area it's like

00:18:51,770 --> 00:19:00,799
when it's a ball 233 and let's do it

00:18:57,529 --> 00:19:03,350
so this is the example booty right so as

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:06,500
I had this that three with letters I can

00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:11,600
have this with my category tree as well

00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:13,419
here I went on to level two and but it

00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,340
works like this I got like the

00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:18,860
Washington surely and this covers fixed

00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:20,899
56 percent of Mary's upset for this

00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:23,090
query coochie and the entropy is pretty

00:19:20,899 --> 00:19:25,190
high so if I add this in the Ottoman pit

00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:26,750
row but I wanna increase the first time

00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:29,000
I maximize the rest and give more

00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:31,730
opportunity for users to find out 56

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,260
percent of my ability set like on the

00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:35,120
other hand like notions

00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:38,740
it's very more probability probably than

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,740
won't include and

00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:43,880
talk about implementation with the

00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:45,649
experiment by plane so the goal is to

00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:49,309
expand the suggestion for both players

00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:50,870
so first we've got all the autocomplete

00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:54,260
suggestions that things that are very

00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:57,500
suggesting we trigger that query without

00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:59,570
any filter we've got the result set the

00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,790
entire result set and you calculate the

00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:03,800
level true category distribution

00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:06,320
we'll calculate the entropy of each of

00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:08,900
this category distributions and your

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:11,570
measured entropy when was above this

00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:13,490
threshold we elected this as a new

00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:16,630
suggestion and you add in the

00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:19,460
autocomplete if he's not there yet so

00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:23,360
for example Gucci

00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:26,240
this was before the in mind that we want

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,400
to this at least in this experiment we

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,080
want to keep the query Alice's we want

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,990
to maximize like if someone searched for

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:35,090
good we want suggest categories on booty

00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:37,310
not we want to minimize the chance of

00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:39,950
had put would men put bags good for

00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:44,390
women as if the user want that probably

00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:47,420
you can he can tap that so by doing this

00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:51,940
running this pipeline we introduce these

00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:53,900
new suggestions but the question is like

00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:56,510
artificially introduced it those

00:20:53,900 --> 00:21:00,470
suggestions there was the popularity and

00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:05,060
this in this first iteration we invited

00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:07,030
apart from the parent so we got the

00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:10,580
parent to the popularity of fashion and

00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:15,350
we uses the this popularity for these

00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:18,200
expansions I couldn't miss the that the

00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:20,690
opportunity to show the example that all

00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:23,150
the search tops helped like if the most

00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:26,420
search for iPhone if our summer search

00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:30,440
for iPhone today we have only phones and

00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:33,100
tablets with this we're gonna start

00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:35,480
suggesting accessories because

00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:38,390
accessories has a bunch of accessories

00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:40,910
in our inventory and they cover a lot of

00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:47,120
the religion so we expanded to

00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:53,660
accessories as well ok so this is the

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:56,030
left part of my top we have like we run

00:21:53,660 --> 00:22:00,170
this in two countries country one

00:21:56,030 --> 00:22:04,940
country one and country to and to expand

00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:07,070
it less than five percent offers or

00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:09,170
suggesting queries because we only touch

00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:12,890
this broad queries that didn't have

00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:14,870
enough power yet but this covers over

00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:15,660
twenty twenty six percent of total

00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:19,920
search

00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:23,400
for the first country and 17% of total

00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:25,050
sales for the second country and the

00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,990
experiment was to compare the

00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:29,580
performance of both groups those that

00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:31,980
we've had abroad twice those that have

00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:35,430
expanded against those that we didn't

00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,930
expect and after doing that about some

00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:39,300
results

00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:42,000
the fourth metric that I wanted to

00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:43,470
collect was a metric it to measure to

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,110
make sure that I was affecting the

00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:48,210
outcome with behavior I didn't want to

00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:50,610
maybe throw do something there and then

00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:52,380
like I want to know if he ever actually

00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:55,050
pick that suggestion I want you to do

00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:57,120
something that that nobody picks so the

00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:59,280
first metric I calculate was the out

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,980
completed users should suggest search

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:04,920
rate which is basically the number the

00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:06,330
the share of just search across total

00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:08,400
surgeries total service likes to just

00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,790
search keyword search filtered search

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:13,710
and then what is there to share like and

00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:16,080
I increase the share in the first

00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:19,350
country by 10 percent in the second

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:23,340
country was flat this number was it was

00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:27,660
not significant another metric that I

00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:30,090
tried as I'm I'm suggesting a search

00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:34,890
with category filters I want to measure

00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:36,630
this filter rate so yes I user pick a

00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:38,670
suggestion and go to the search page and

00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:40,530
if is not right the filters out right

00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:43,830
probably the user has to redefine the

00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:46,260
future and in the in the search page and

00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:48,360
once you measure this rate like how many

00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:51,630
was the rate like if you user has refute

00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:53,670
or less it is better and some of

00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:56,760
servation diversification back to user

00:23:53,670 --> 00:24:00,360
behavior not complete as you can see see

00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:02,310
one users tracking more apparently but

00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,780
it's true users speak less suggestion

00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:06,000
but better ones because the filter which

00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:07,530
was better and to try to solve this

00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,530
question also asked some business

00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:12,360
metrics it's very hard to calculate

00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:13,650
business metrics for outcome page

00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:15,300
because that completes the beginning

00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:17,070
funnel and then I have the search page

00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:19,890
the filters and then go through the add

00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:22,440
page in that page a user can send a

00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:25,740
reply if he like it the that is the

00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:28,710
conversion rate for OLX and i measure

00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:29,460
two groups of features like quiet

00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:31,410
metrics

00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:34,260
so here I measure the publicity are in

00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:36,270
the reply rate of that party that

00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:39,330
explained it doesn't matter if the user

00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:42,090
B cannot my suggestions suggestion and I

00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:44,490
water lifting in first country and not

00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:48,570
at all lift in the second country in

00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:50,850
flat results for reply rate and I also

00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:52,500
calculated the performance of those

00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:55,500
things that I actually spent the

00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:57,300
category and turns out that I could good

00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:00,120
results for both in both countries

00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:02,820
so this says promising is like a

00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:05,190
research like Putin production database

00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:08,340
to research phases promised for c1 and

00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:10,260
c2 my maybe replace that the relevant

00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:12,090
suggested I put every place or the the

00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:14,130
rink is the problem here in both

00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:16,620
countries new suggests cut a Tangra look

00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:18,720
relevant at least I I suggest categories

00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:24,360
that like user interactive engage it and

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:28,110
comfort okay to finish my my talk design

00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:30,660
stage experiment so for the first and

00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:32,790
simple interaction I want to extend this

00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:35,370
to effect more countries and McRae's and

00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:38,070
also an interesting study now the impact

00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:40,320
in short and long term and also true to

00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:42,300
that I can maybe consider ranking not

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,300
the entire result set but top end

00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:47,850
results explore more cluster dimensions

00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:50,730
and also define a better entropy and

00:25:47,850 --> 00:25:52,440
proper thresholds because I had called

00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:54,630
the entropy and the popularity and then

00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,330
this is like eBay my estimated likely

00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:59,340
prior but over time and when I get more

00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:02,090
observations maybe I can refine this and

00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:06,380
have my complete self

00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:09,590
diversify fine let's see and that's it

00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:09,590
thanks guys

00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,790
