Carrefour started the journey of digital transformation 6 years ago, transforming the e-commerce business into an omnichannel business using an “all in one” e-commerce platform where Search was one more piece of the puzzle.

In time, Carrefour technical team realized that through an open and flexible Search solution, the e-commerce platform could be constructed around it, making Search (and Navigation) the core as opposed to an add-on or an element on the periphery.

This approach, at first, implied several challenges, from strategic to technical ones:

What options do we have? Use a SaaS solution, build a search from scratch, Base our search in an existing solution, Look for a partner to help us to build it… 

How can we keep the intellectual property and the know-how inside the company?
 
What experience do we want to offer to our customers?
 
How can we deal with a huge assortment of products from different natures and stores? 

What insights do we expect to take form the search to help our business?
 
How do we know whether the search is performing well?
 
What strategy do we have to follow for replacement the old search engine keeping, at the same time, the rest of the “all in one” e-commerce platform?
 
How do we develop it and deploy it into production?
 
How do we evolve it?

hello everyone my name is especially on

00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:15,250
weights and

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,490
the software development director for

00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:22,349
carat or Spain or the Commerce

00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:26,250
Department and today I will talk to you

00:00:22,349 --> 00:00:30,429
about our experience replacing our

00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:32,199
commercial shirts by our own shirts you

00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:34,360
can control you can control the roadmap

00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:45,460
and we can control the technology behind

00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:49,300
the start so well here is my contact my

00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:51,270
colleagues contact whorfin he's gonna

00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:55,210
talk later

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:58,920
well you need some information above us

00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:05,979
you can stand our called OCR profiles

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:07,420
Wow just before get insert I would like

00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:09,820
to talk about a little bit about color

00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:13,899
first thing that I first pin second that

00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:18,159
Bianca is one of the biggest retailer in

00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:24,310
the world it has more than 200 thousand

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:29,500
stores in 30 countries and specifically

00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:33,400
talking about food ecommerce we have any

00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:38,320
commerce with two sites full side animal

00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:42,640
style the first one has 27,000 foot

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:46,600
problems 7 million of customers in our

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:50,140
our Larry blood we have a marketplace in

00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:59,530
the food style is 3 million roubles from

00:01:50,140 --> 00:02:01,719
one point five thousand dollars so the

00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:06,430
platform that makes possible this

00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:09,119
business is our e-commerce platform fast

00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:13,540
we are in the middle of a migration

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:16,570
where we are migrating for this kind of

00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:20,890
all-in-one solution that you can hire

00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:24,430
from traditional vendors to micro

00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:28,500
services architecture built by our

00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:33,430
engineer baikal forest

00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:36,970
so it's this project is a four-year

00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:39,700
project to replace the hot platform what

00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:42,550
we are going to do this or wider what we

00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:45,130
are doing right now is taking different

00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:47,940
pieces of the e-commerce platform this

00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:52,030
is the old one language search the

00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:55,590
catalog the price million the for

00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:59,140
example Mexico and they blow this

00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:04,660
functionality into our metro service

00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:07,090
architecture in the cloud it's hundred

00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:10,060
percent many collaborative so that means

00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:12,400
that it's is over kubernetes with

00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:16,269
kubernetes in mind i'm scholarly the

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:19,810
lastest scalability deploy in Google

00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:23,230
Cloud and all is based on open source

00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:30,610
technologies because is our philosophy

00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:34,840
and the first side was launched in 2019

00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:41,799
so far working fine now we don't have

00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:47,230
any major issue amount so talking about

00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:49,780
shirts now this time is the part of this

00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:54,910
racket sector that we've replaced last

00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:57,519
year and it was a really tough challenge

00:03:54,910 --> 00:04:02,320
because we had to replace a converse

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:07,600
dessert which was included in this kind

00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:12,040
of all one platforms and to the lamb we

00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:13,750
had to face some challenges the first

00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:18,220
one it was I was time to customer

00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:21,780
behaviors so in the old one the metrics

00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:26,590
that we found was very poor

00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:30,370
didn't know what what was happening from

00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:35,920
the side of the customer because we

00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:39,670
don't know what they were looking for if

00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:43,090
the search was very lack rated not so we

00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:46,480
have no idea about what is happening in

00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:50,490
terms of the sets so the second one is

00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:58,360
to build proper sets experience with

00:04:50,490 --> 00:05:00,160
very accurate user experience and while

00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:07,330
we have to define our relevance ranking

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:09,550
to 19 policies and we have to avoid to

00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,560
configure manually a lot of rules that

00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:13,840
they are very difficult to maintain over

00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:18,430
the time we were looking for something

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:22,030
more automatic like a or machine

00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:24,160
learning and we have to get rid a

00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:27,490
catalog data because in this kind of

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,870
platform where holds include you don't

00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:32,140
have to worry about the catalog data

00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:36,070
feeds it's part of distribution so we

00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:38,230
had improperly the kid with Nathan I'm

00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:42,700
very well prepared to index by a

00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:45,640
certainty and we have to integrate the

00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:47,770
Commerce the search engine into our

00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:50,110
e-commerce platform you have to deploy

00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:53,890
it in 2000 pull a plug which is our

00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:54,820
table and complete the whole project in

00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:58,480
seven months

00:05:54,820 --> 00:06:01,150
which is why aggressive but finally

00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:08,620
thanks to the teams involved in this in

00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:10,960
this project we need it so at this point

00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:14,530
we don't really know what to do

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:18,100
but the next question is how you can do

00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:21,340
it so Lance who we went to the market

00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:27,100
and see what officers didn't have and

00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:30,370
the options we had was mainly three the

00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:32,440
first one it was about to be an

00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:35,530
Oktoberfest in the furnace rats using

00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:40,030
our team but the problem is we realize

00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:43,060
that we haven't got this kind of

00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:45,130
knowledge this kind of expertise because

00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:48,100
we have a very good developer very good

00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:48,930
architects integration engineers but we

00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:56,610
don't have certain

00:06:48,930 --> 00:07:00,000
years have taken years so at least it's

00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:02,940
gonna it's it's gonna take a long time

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,990
to to build a proper search engine maybe

00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:10,680
we can add something and then BP maybe

00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:15,180
in two years so it wasn't a portable or

00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:17,250
for business so the second option the

00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:20,370
option being was to hire a service a

00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:24,630
service solution this is the most

00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:25,979
attractive option because the only thing

00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:30,389
that you have to do is to generate

00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:34,259
little bit of it plug it into integrated

00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:37,680
into the server service solution and the

00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:40,530
missed opportunity ends but from our

00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:44,240
point of view this can work for small

00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:47,780
catalogue but how to market presence

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:51,419
with remote three million of problems

00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:53,699
very different kind of problems we

00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:58,229
prefer to control all their volumes

00:07:53,699 --> 00:08:00,120
inside the search engine I'm integrate

00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:03,870
the search in unison this way with the

00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:07,680
data we have in telephone so to extend

00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:11,190
the search engine this option wasn't the

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:16,080
best for us and we had to do all these

00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:17,849
recipes as well and the option see it

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,650
was to look for a partner with existing

00:08:17,849 --> 00:08:25,620
solution which you can take and deploy

00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:29,659
into your cloud and build your search

00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:36,690
experience over an existing solution so

00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:41,130
this is what we did actually but we the

00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:44,850
technology is not enough we needed a

00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:48,839
company with culture that fits in our

00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:53,100
culture so we are a very customer

00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:55,589
centric company so we were looking for a

00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,450
company like this in customer centric

00:08:55,589 --> 00:09:02,230
philosophy or given to spine

00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:06,820
collaborative general dirty course but

00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:10,990
in the retail industry is we are

00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:14,470
constantly changing and focused in us

00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:17,230
because what happiness is not only about

00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:20,860
the technologies how do you present let

00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:24,970
technology to your customer how your

00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:27,280
customer is using new technology and of

00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:30,550
course a technology knowledge even has

00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:32,500
to be based on and micro service

00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:35,680
architecture because we have a micro

00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:39,520
services architecture so we were looking

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:41,890
for a solution where you can select the

00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:43,450
different components instead the

00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:48,000
component that you want into your

00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:52,770
application and use those components so

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:56,380
it has to be also based on open source

00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:58,240
as to present a platform easy to deploy

00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:01,060
and operate that's very important for us

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:04,330
because in the past we saw a lot of pain

00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:06,670
I'm trying to operate this kind of

00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:09,190
solution where you have the black bottle

00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:17,370
you know what's happened inside the box

00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:21,520
and it has to be approved solution for

00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:23,860
high demand traffic because we have

00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:27,670
companies like Black Friday where we we

00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:32,070
suffer I feel - spikes of traffic and we

00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:32,070
have to give certain reasoning for spots

00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:41,970
so when you have

00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:44,880
the pattern in place you know what to do

00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:47,279
then you have to do a plan not planning

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,380
and this is the ferret plan the first

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,889
stage of the program was to discover

00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:55,970
what to do what was our solution or

00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:59,940
solutions embodied a protrusion and

00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:03,300
overall to discover what this

00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:06,180
technically this search phonology can do

00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:12,149
with our data and modify the after may

00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:15,569
be needed and the second phase the

00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:17,430
second stage it was to build the proper

00:11:15,569 --> 00:11:21,089
solution integrated with our tongues

00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:24,329
button the third one was the hardening

00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:29,250
to fix those digital forgotten to be the

00:11:24,329 --> 00:11:32,250
face or you did in a bad manner and the

00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:34,440
last-born is to tune all the application

00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:36,089
all the search engine within the

00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,329
e-commerce platform in the Google Cloud

00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:43,949
so after just a memory the course the

00:11:39,329 --> 00:11:46,380
kubernetes staff and of course the lxd

00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:53,730
search because last assesses the core of

00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:57,420
the of the search engine so this is how

00:11:53,730 --> 00:12:00,959
it looks all the time mean we start with

00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:03,360
a pilot not very fancy interface but we

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:06,480
demonstrate all the things that we

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:09,350
wanted to do from that and we fast

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:13,740
repeat them the ether was introduction

00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:18,120
during three months around and it was

00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:20,610
almost fully functional and it was

00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:24,510
leaving starters to do three to three

00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:27,899
months and the last one is the one that

00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:30,240
we have now entered a food yes and while

00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:33,180
is fully functional it's over all the

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,459
particles that we have forward and

00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:38,339
forward the global one

00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:41,399
and so far is working fine and people

00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:43,519
actually use our power sets list and we

00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,519
go

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:57,260
so at this point I'm going to introduce

00:12:51,080 --> 00:13:01,240
my colleague Barton Barton help us with

00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:04,280
all the user experience about shirts and

00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:07,280
well he can tell us all the process done

00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:11,180
he lived to his ass so hoorah

00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:14,330
and whenever you born thank you I

00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:16,370
suppose thank you so much for the

00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:20,090
invitation of course and you know it's

00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:23,960
been very personally linked to this

00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:26,540
project it was an absolute joy to work

00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:29,060
with you guys especially after the the

00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:31,670
you know the marvelous results obtained

00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:34,550
right both from our design in that

00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:39,170
performance perspective right

00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:39,590
hello folks my name is Baraka I'm from

00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:42,670
empathy

00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:46,070
I was the design lead of these projects

00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:48,010
which we are still working on but we're

00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:51,950
gonna present today this very first

00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:57,410
stage of it and I'm gonna talk for the

00:13:51,950 --> 00:14:01,310
next five minutes on design okay both on

00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:04,940
the challenges that we overcame and also

00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:09,460
the process we followed so before I get

00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:14,540
into the matter I would like to stress

00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:17,980
they need to tackle a third project from

00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:22,280
an experiences side of things as well

00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:26,900
okay I've been working on for more than

00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:31,280
15 years on certs projects on relevancy

00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:35,480
modeling on you know algorithms features

00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:38,090
and again it does not matter how much

00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:42,020
time you spend on technology okay you

00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:48,730
you must have of course relevant results

00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:52,520
for people to find but the how people

00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:55,640
experience how people connect with

00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:58,500
brands the emotions that you're able to

00:14:55,640 --> 00:15:02,070
evoke through the experiences is

00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,690
as critical or even more than the

00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:06,930
results on their own

00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:08,940
okay so always please please spend

00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:13,530
enough time you know if it's never

00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:18,180
enough on the experiences because it

00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:23,010
will be a very very important aspect of

00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:28,590
your success right so moving into the

00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:33,210
certs project in Kara for so the first

00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:35,730
thing we looked at was we have a massive

00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:39,960
catalog I mean we're talking about three

00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:44,550
million products and again the diversity

00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:48,170
and complexity of intent it's brutal

00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:53,220
I mean it is huge we have people

00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:56,100
searching for tomatoes in apples as part

00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:58,290
of the food groceries and as well we

00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:01,140
have people searching for a mattress or

00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:04,320
searching for a barbecue or searching

00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:08,010
for a TV set so again you guys work in

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:13,040
inserts you know that the patterns used

00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:16,530
to access those very different set of

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:20,940
items it's very very diverse ok the the

00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:25,020
the the way you help people find explore

00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:28,050
and research on those item discoveries

00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:32,340
is totally opposite so that was a main

00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:34,410
main challenge the second one it's very

00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:37,560
it's aligned to this one it's whether

00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:40,670
from an experience perspective how do we

00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:43,980
take people from a global search box

00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:47,040
okay where you can search in the whole

00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:52,050
of Kara for in two very vertical very

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:55,050
specific search vertical search

00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:59,610
experiences that are highly driven by

00:16:55,050 --> 00:17:02,790
the characteristics of say ink

00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:05,220
cartridges for printers or a TV set

00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:08,550
whether you want a curve or not or the

00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:12,420
size of the screen so these sort of

00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:15,900
things really were a big

00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:18,000
big thing that we needed to coherently

00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,940
bring into the experiences and the

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,880
journeys of people navigate inserting

00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:26,970
and exploring care for the third item

00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:30,090
and as important as well is the

00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:34,310
diversity in this case of personas and

00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:38,130
the data behind it we have carofoley

00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:42,240
fortunate to have very a very loyal

00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:45,000
customer base and they are very rich

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,750
data sets to do with the purchase

00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,020
history on and off as well and as other

00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:54,570
signals that can be used to personalize

00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:57,810
search on the other end we have people

00:17:54,570 --> 00:18:01,620
that's not anonymous but there are no

00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:03,660
track records regarding purchase but we

00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:05,940
know that they are in a landing page and

00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:11,660
we know that they have an intent

00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:16,200
declared so how can we use all those

00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:19,380
inputs so that's the experience is how

00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:22,200
good fits for all those personas and

00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:24,570
lastly this is more to do with a

00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:28,880
commercial thing as well as as a

00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:32,700
customer experience but in the on-site

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:37,470
sorry offline California's got a catalog

00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:39,600
and online it is a bigger catalog due to

00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:42,690
the marketplace so people should be

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:45,120
aware that products have been sorted in

00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:48,660
a different way they should be aware

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:51,120
that the logistics the the vendor

00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:54,450
information has to be surfaced and all

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:58,560
these things that also need to be very

00:18:54,450 --> 00:19:01,710
well entangle into the experience good

00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:05,730
so how do we go across knowing this how

00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:09,330
do we go across into the design so the

00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:12,690
phase one it's always out understanding

00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:15,030
the context ok so we need to understand

00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:18,420
how people use search previously so we

00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:20,340
normally go through the analytics we go

00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:23,340
of course through the and more

00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:24,830
importantly through the intended

00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:27,799
behaviors

00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:30,230
how do we want people to feel throughout

00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:32,480
this part of the through of a certain

00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:35,450
journey when they open the search box

00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,750
before they start typing when they start

00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:40,580
typing so we'll go through the brand

00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:43,279
values we go through the design

00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:46,549
principles the visual language that has

00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:50,809
to be used and we start working on the

00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:54,110
user journey mapping okay so we are able

00:19:50,809 --> 00:19:58,940
to associate emotions to each of those

00:19:54,110 --> 00:20:01,669
moments of the journey right so now we

00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:08,659
can move into Phase two now we can start

00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:10,909
sketching these mobile sketches and

00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:14,179
diagrams and we can move on into

00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:18,350
mock-ups wireframes markups animated

00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:20,779
mock-ups prototypes user testing and as

00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:25,010
these iterations move on you end up with

00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:27,139
a very complex diagram with the use of

00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:29,750
flows that incorporate all these

00:20:27,139 --> 00:20:33,169
personas all these use cases all this

00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:36,950
personal data and all this transparency

00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:41,510
and Trust controls that we always seek

00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:45,100
to obtain so that consumers really feel

00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:48,080
bonded and feel connected to the brand

00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:51,200
through use insert that was my time my

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:54,260
time is up guys thank you very much and

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,870
I'll talk to you after after his

00:20:54,260 --> 00:21:00,740
finishes in doing the Q&A session all

00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:04,460
back to you guys thank you okay thank

00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:05,299
you very much for the plot it was pretty

00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:08,210
good

00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:12,380
to listen to you how you did all this

00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:15,260
for us and what did continue with this I

00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:19,250
would like to the power so this is an

00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:21,710
architecture that for us we are the most

00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:24,919
important one because there is how we

00:21:21,710 --> 00:21:28,340
integrate actually the empathy solution

00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:32,539
into our system and we can start with a

00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:34,730
couple of regeneration because it was

00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:37,350
very tough very it took me time it was

00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:42,730
very detailed and

00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:46,509
what we did is we took all the things

00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:48,789
that we are really hard in the

00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:51,129
e-commerce stuff from like the prices

00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:53,529
throughout the inventory and promotions

00:21:51,129 --> 00:21:58,029
macro services we synchronized

00:21:53,529 --> 00:22:02,190
everything from the central systems from

00:21:58,029 --> 00:22:03,299
the PM from the price engine from the

00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:06,940
[Music]

00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:11,409
inventory upload all this information

00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:14,369
via a capital Q and then what happened

00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:18,639
is when you have all this information

00:22:14,369 --> 00:22:20,379
distributed in the mines it's very

00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:25,570
difficult to get into integrity

00:22:20,379 --> 00:22:28,749
so the most easy way to do this this is

00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:30,820
way to do this is to take all this

00:22:28,749 --> 00:22:34,179
information all the loop that happens

00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:38,379
within these micro services and then

00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:42,429
start everything into a single 531

00:22:38,379 --> 00:22:45,309
firmly single document per per troubled

00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:48,249
soul so when you have the whole picture

00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:49,899
of their travels in a single document

00:22:48,249 --> 00:22:53,889
you can store this kind of documents in

00:22:49,899 --> 00:22:56,049
the database I believe every single

00:22:53,889 --> 00:22:59,999
movement like practice inventory under

00:22:56,049 --> 00:23:03,730
one and then extract everything

00:22:59,999 --> 00:23:05,889
Eugenia data per customer as fine job

00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:08,619
actually he takes everything and

00:23:05,889 --> 00:23:11,889
transformed this information into a

00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:13,809
cloud storage so in cloud storage we

00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:18,429
have several titles with all the

00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:20,889
information that we need to index in the

00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:23,710
center the last extraction the head of

00:23:20,889 --> 00:23:26,710
the solution so what it does the

00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:30,279
solution takes these files you should

00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:37,960
make around this and store everything

00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:41,860
into the grand elastic cluster the other

00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:46,090
part of the architecture that it's very

00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:48,129
worried to to to talk about if the

00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:50,150
enrichment data it what it does actually

00:23:48,129 --> 00:23:53,540
Richmond it is

00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:56,360
into customer it takes all the events

00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:58,550
that comes from the front end store this

00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:02,270
Evans into packet files

00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:07,100
thanks to cloud dataflow and then we

00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:10,580
have a last data per cluster with

00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:13,490
several spark jobs that takes all the

00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:16,310
insight from these files and if this is

00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:19,640
inside we store this information into

00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:23,420
the elastic cluster and in MongoDB for a

00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:29,540
statistical problems purpose and for to

00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:33,380
make the search smarter because thanks

00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:36,020
to this we have next queries we

00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:38,600
calculated tax we have outer suggestions

00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:45,110
we have all the fancy stuff around the

00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:48,080
search and the last one it's how we

00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:51,200
integrate the API into our existing

00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:53,660
e-commerce solution so what we used is

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:59,860
the button for instant pattern

00:24:53,660 --> 00:25:03,590
so with this microservices the search

00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:06,500
presentation API microservice when does

00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:09,320
his lunch in parallel several requests

00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:13,840
to price from Bentley promotion and

00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:17,090
others and to the Search API and compose

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:21,410
a single response that we sent to

00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:24,710
empathy yes yes an empathy exists is the

00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:28,190
component from empathy in charge of show

00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:31,340
the result list in the best way for the

00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:35,630
customer so with all the user experience

00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:40,480
and we design in the in the in the

00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:40,480
previous stage of the of the planet

00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:52,850
talking about components we want to talk

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:56,900
about the components from the

00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:58,880
perspective of what we do for us what

00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:01,640
what means for us prepare food

00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:03,030
so for example the indexing process and

00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:07,470
the operational

00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:10,590
TV is it's a very happy because the

00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:15,840
indexing process always never failed we

00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:18,420
have a success rate about 98% the

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:23,130
Richmond Index movie of the one always

00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:26,630
known apparently and we have the two

00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:29,970
engine and with the tooling the

00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:32,910
marketers are pretty hot as well because

00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:37,230
compared with the other the control is

00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:40,590
very easy to use the they don't have so

00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:43,680
many rules Mongoose to maintains so

00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:47,550
because the the search engine itself can

00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:51,840
relax to the things of the interests of

00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:55,410
customers so the only thing is to see if

00:26:51,840 --> 00:27:00,450
the search is behaving in a proper way

00:26:55,410 --> 00:27:02,510
and adapt some things on zone just

00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:05,580
something that the waste of some

00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:09,690
attributes and post-abortion families

00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:13,050
and it helps us work with promotional

00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:16,230
stuff because now they can insert

00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:18,720
banners into the rasulu list and with

00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:21,750
this banner they can sell this is space

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:24,420
to other providers so well it's

00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:27,740
something that the marketers do and at

00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:30,570
the end they do several polish games and

00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:35,510
the last one is to talk about sets such

00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:38,070
components and what apart from all the

00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:42,480
usual speed and that office to our

00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:47,100
customer where the accuracy of the for

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:50,100
the search but really it helped for the

00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:52,980
colorful engineers because this is

00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:56,400
something that people don't use the top

00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:58,530
but well for us it was a big improvement

00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,420
because the productivity of our

00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:01,860
developers increase a lot because they

00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:04,830
only thing that they have to do is

00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:07,830
consume if he has and focus on the users

00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:10,950
aliens or other information the tasks

00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:14,630
that we are have that they are they are

00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:16,920
working on and forget those things of

00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:20,760
understand the black box

00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:23,070
about the sets their behavior than

00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:33,120
unexpected behavior that they all sense

00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:38,090
had so at this point we would like to

00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:43,260
share with you a small story about the

00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:44,910
jerseys were believed with all the cove

00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:48,390
identity in the staff all the

00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:53,040
communities in crisis so it was a small

00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:58,920
story about masks and how the church can

00:28:53,040 --> 00:29:02,330
react to the demand of our customers so

00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:06,960
the thing is when people think in masks

00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:11,010
before the community crisis people were

00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:13,230
thinking about beauty mask but when all

00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:19,020
the question happens all the prisoners

00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:23,750
come up what people want when they look

00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:30,870
for masks they are they are thinking in

00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:36,200
some dreamers the once antagonist so we

00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:41,820
took some information from our search

00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:42,930
from the search insights and we see that

00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:47,970
before

00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:52,320
the commitment in crisis people was

00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:56,730
waiting for max to find or it must of

00:29:52,320 --> 00:30:03,630
all kind of it max for sanitary mask it

00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:06,420
was a few persons looking for sanitary

00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:08,880
masks but the rest of the people were

00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:12,780
looking for beauty must

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:17,070
but during convenient in crisis

00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:21,530
apart from increase of the queries with

00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:25,470
word masks what people were looking for

00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:29,370
was a sentiments so compared with others

00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:31,880
during the community faces it's a bit

00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,880
different

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:40,870
so what happens in terms of the cells so

00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:44,440
the cells attack automatically all day

00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:48,340
out of suggestions and next queries well

00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:53,470
so here you can see the wood must carry

00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:56,830
and that means masks and the suggestions

00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:59,800
is look for malaria some Italian it

00:30:56,830 --> 00:31:04,090
means some sacraments and apart from

00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:10,900
that the search automatically suggests

00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:13,720
loans and sanitary gear as well because

00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:16,600
there are the people people used to look

00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:21,550
for masks and then look for those and

00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:24,970
then look for sanitary oh so the church

00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:28,840
can realize this thing and add up all

00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:33,100
the suggestions based on this and that's

00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:38,320
not seen its how automatically the

00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:49,450
result list promotes they must the

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:54,340
central mass of the youth mask so in

00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:59,710
this example you can see the difference

00:31:54,340 --> 00:32:03,310
between the secretary mask and beauty

00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:07,570
max in terms of promotions the results

00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:13,200
so one two and three are boosted

00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:16,450
automatically actually the most boost

00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,700
result is the second one but there are

00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:21,910
some business rules that promote the

00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:24,430
first one it's basically because it

00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:29,980
belongs to the footside and has more

00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:33,660
priority but if we look for beauty mask

00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:36,910
we find out that no one of them are

00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:40,650
boosted because they are this time they

00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:40,650
are very important for people

00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:58,540
so the results of all of this but what

00:32:51,550 --> 00:33:00,940
the results so in the Green Line with is

00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:08,370
the distant point in the in the time

00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:11,890
where we launched our empathy search

00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:16,050
into the public we have the

00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:18,790
interpersonal for a while but for the

00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:22,090
for the public for the rest of the

00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:25,390
customer we launched this the in the end

00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:28,960
of the January and from the very

00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:34,120
beginning what you can see is a spike in

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:38,890
the number of queries that customers

00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:42,190
thus against the the search engine and

00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:46,660
we increased from almost two to almost

00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:49,600
fourth yes from the very beginning and

00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:54,130
that means we increase the number of

00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:57,670
searches per session producer in a forty

00:33:54,130 --> 00:34:00,640
eight percent so but at the same time

00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:03,870
what is very important is the wonderful

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:08,669
period of customers that use the search

00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:13,720
decrease in forty nine percent so people

00:34:08,669 --> 00:34:15,990
stay in our website more time playing

00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:20,440
with the search navigated Nashua

00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:25,659
fortunately find something and well of

00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:30,580
course these two things that you can see

00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:33,730
in doing maybe the second decision will

00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:36,190
marks that's because the coronavirus

00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:41,159
crisis because we face a lot of traffic

00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:45,300
on my way the search coped with traffic

00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:45,300
with no major issues

00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:55,520
well next step

00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:59,130
let's to finalize that and the talk so

00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:03,530
we have several things to do in the

00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:07,079
future in terms of chart we have to

00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:13,410
still improve in all desserts in terms

00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:16,890
of performance accuracy the variability

00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:17,520
and devolution itself of the stress

00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:20,940
rhenium

00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:23,990
the second one the second most important

00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:26,640
thing after this year is the navigation

00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:29,250
broaching the Catalan ocean we are

00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,460
planning to use the solution for the

00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:34,140
problem listing pages for example

00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:38,359
deterioration that'll make it integrated

00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:45,480
with the shop in and all the things

00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:47,880
related to catalog we are going to place

00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:52,349
the research in the middle of the

00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:54,839
e-commerce platform and use the specs

00:35:52,349 --> 00:36:01,230
for almost everything related to the

00:35:54,839 --> 00:36:03,950
catalog and the third one is to still

00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:08,160
working in going distillation that means

00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:10,349
we want to get all this information we

00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,390
have in every phase of that house we

00:36:10,349 --> 00:36:15,740
have a lot of information about our

00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:19,530
customers and improve the

00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:23,010
personalization and we can do it one to

00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:29,069
one that takes a lot of challenge like

00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:36,859
privacy we need to solve but it's a path

00:36:29,069 --> 00:36:39,930
that we want to to work well that's all

00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:45,150
thanks for listens

00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:49,920
I hope this was really interesting for

00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:54,900
you and again less less for listen thank

00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:59,609
you very much thank you here's us Thank

00:36:54,900 --> 00:37:01,530
You Borja so we don't have much time for

00:36:59,609 --> 00:37:03,020
questions but we do have a couple of

00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:06,080
minutes

00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:12,830
after summarize them here

00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:15,260
so you mentioned a you mentioned the

00:37:12,830 --> 00:37:18,200
current situation and copied 19 that

00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:20,480
affected the way the search worked which

00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:23,240
was great and we had a question from

00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,600
angel that wanted to hear how that

00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:30,940
impacted some other areas like groceries

00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:36,680
and staples like goods like food and

00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:39,500
basic basic needs okay so the first tip

00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:43,340
I thought we had was we suffer suddenly

00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:45,560
a big traffic an amazing one we never we

00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:52,490
never seen such a man traffic in our

00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:54,590
grocery online grocery and well we have

00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:55,250
some trouble that the people demand at

00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:58,970
most

00:37:55,250 --> 00:38:03,860
for example the floor the paper toilet

00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:06,130
the market itself that was a change in

00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:08,960
the behavior of the customers that

00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:13,460
impact for example to the supply chain a

00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:17,690
area they had to buy from other

00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:20,200
providers to see where they had to look

00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:26,180
for these kind of problems in other

00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:30,710
countries for example so it was a change

00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:35,390
and they offer flats because the Hedden

00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:39,980
man that we had in terms of search well

00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:43,430
a situation in the slightest it in their

00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:45,680
behavior a lot in customers so thanks

00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:47,750
for for this kind of assess that we have

00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,240
right now we can react to the man of the

00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:57,680
people and offer the probes that they

00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:59,930
need thank you hisses so the another

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,670
question is about the data flow so the

00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:04,490
fact that you showed how the data is

00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:07,060
ingested was appreciated

00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:09,700
and the question was

00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:11,350
so a very specific questions from from

00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:15,250
Ronnie about the data flow that

00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:16,570
mentioned the concept of POD and the

00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:19,900
question was what would be encapsulated

00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:26,100
in a pod and what's the purpose of the

00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:28,780
okay well actually a boat is a workload

00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:31,030
it's something it's a concept from

00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:33,640
kubernetes it's not something special

00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:37,570
what we are is a small application we

00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:40,870
can be blowing into Vanitas so in it

00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:43,150
that in terms of the search what we are

00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:45,340
encapsulated in the pod is a small

00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:48,040
application that he just takes all the

00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:52,410
air coming from the front end and tap

00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:56,080
the heaven to add the flow to transform

00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:59,020
from a specific time window this

00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:00,250
information into parkade files that's

00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:04,420
it's a quite simple

00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:10,150
come take a trunk of any disease it's a

00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:14,380
technical one so maybe one last question

00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:17,890
or maybe a two if we have time about the

00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:20,320
so it seems like a long journey

00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:22,180
you mentioned sixty-six years in the

00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:27,340
beginning so there were a lot of

00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:28,720
challenges to address we had questions

00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:30,970
about like what was the biggest

00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:36,130
challenge for for you and especially

00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:38,890
about Google Google cloud platform was

00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:42,190
that connected to a cloud or maybe not

00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:45,420
what was the bloody challenge we we had

00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:49,720
several big big really big challenge so

00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:52,180
from the last six since the last last

00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:57,280
six years we had for example the first

00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:59,470
one was to to deploy the first old moon

00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:03,930
solution this kind of platform that you

00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:09,850
can have from traditional vendors and

00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:11,560
the second one was where was to realize

00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:16,140
that the platform wasn't enough for us

00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:20,349
for our business and to make a plan to

00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:23,380
platform everything and

00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:26,829
that but happens maybe in 2-3 years so

00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:30,700
it was a very short time of of life of

00:41:26,829 --> 00:41:34,119
distant platform so and the challenge

00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:36,009
here was to how to decouple all the

00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:39,160
single pieces that this kind of a

00:41:36,009 --> 00:41:43,779
platform has to chop all the platform

00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:47,559
into pieces and deployed this kind of

00:41:43,779 --> 00:41:49,930
functionality from scratch into Google

00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:53,559
Cloud using modern technology like

00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:57,220
kubernetes or Malinda no Eli span jobs

00:41:53,559 --> 00:42:00,910
or Apache being or wherever you are half

00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:03,519
available on the cloud ok so thank you

00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:05,789
thank you Jesus Thank You Borja thanks

00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:05,789
everyone

00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:14,550
