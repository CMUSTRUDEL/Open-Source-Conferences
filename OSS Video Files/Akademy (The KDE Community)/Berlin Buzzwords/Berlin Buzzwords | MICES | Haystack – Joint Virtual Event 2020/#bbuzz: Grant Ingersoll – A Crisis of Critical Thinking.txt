A crisis of critical thinking - what Wikipedia can teach us about the future of information and technology’s role

Over time, we have all become avid consumers of information. Yet that information is increasingly fragmented and partisan, based on isolated effort instead of consensus. As we look to the future of information production, how can we build solutions that incentivize people to learn from each other, to understand the full complexity and nuance behind an issue instead of just their own perspective?

For the past two decades, Wikipedia has been helping humans and machines process the entire spectrum of information, from lengthy research and graduate level dissertations at one end to soundbites and trivia questions dictated to voice assistants at the other. We can provide a valuable model for how technology can help the next generation of knowledge-seekers decode, decipher and analyze information. This talk will focus on knowledge in the next evolution of the internet, and how we must enable not just more access to information, but also critical thinking at global scale.

hello everyone and thank you for tuning

00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:16,970
in and welcome to Berlin buzzwords I'm

00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,949
excited to be here and I thank you for

00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,980
showing up in support of this conference

00:00:18,949 --> 00:00:24,349
this is of course a very different

00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:28,669
experience from the very first Berlin

00:00:24,349 --> 00:00:30,439
was were noted 11 or so years ago oh but

00:00:28,669 --> 00:00:32,660
regardless as to whether it is in person

00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:35,840
in one of my favorite cities in the

00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:38,360
world Berlin or done virtually as we are

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,280
now I'm really excited to have the

00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:44,090
opportunity to kick things off with you

00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:46,580
all today before we dive into the next

00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:48,620
30 minutes do want to step back and

00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,650
acknowledge what's happening all around

00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:53,030
us even while we still show up here and

00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:56,210
are trying to learn and improve

00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:59,060
ourselves whether you are from the

00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:01,160
United States or not or personally

00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:04,129
affected by current events whether that

00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:06,799
is systemic racism in your home country

00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:09,409
the ongoing global pandemic the

00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,360
worldwide protests or simply are just

00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:13,580
deeply concerned about your ability to

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,159
earn a living I hope you and your loved

00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:18,350
ones are safe and I hope we can all come

00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,900
to these really tough questions facing

00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:23,090
us as a world with an open mind and an

00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:25,670
open heart that is focused on making

00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:28,250
this conference our collective shared

00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:33,229
interest in technology and our broader

00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:36,590
world welcoming to all to that end I

00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:39,680
want to explore with you a question that

00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:42,350
is the inspiration for why I joined the

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,750
Wikimedia Foundation as CTO 10 months

00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:47,060
ago or so one that I think is very much

00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:51,290
relevant to this group and the topics

00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:53,510
that we all think about daily as someone

00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:56,090
with a background in search discovery

00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:59,450
and information seeking it's a question

00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:03,020
that has plagued me for years never more

00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:06,460
so than now given current events the

00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:10,220
rise of disinformation and gratification

00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:13,849
culture I want to explore this question

00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:17,569
how can we use tech to help people

00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:20,870
think more critically ideally Aztecas

00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:25,760
want to do with less work or at least

00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:28,459
less time put another way I want to ask

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,159
the question how do we shrink the time

00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:33,549
it takes for each of us to get to that

00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:36,079
personal augment

00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:39,260
especially when we are considering

00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:41,650
deeply difficult topics that often

00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:45,290
require our multiple points of view and

00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:47,419
engagement over time now when I first

00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:49,129
submitted this talk way back in what

00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:52,040
seems like ancient times of I think

00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:54,079
January I originally thought I would

00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:57,319
explore this idea of critical thinking

00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:59,000
through the lens of a current event but

00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:01,519
I ultimately came to the conclusion to

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,299
start with a lighter subject and show

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:09,909
how I quickly it can lead to very deep

00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:09,909
and thoughtful reflection on a subject

00:03:10,269 --> 00:03:15,260
so I hope you will indulge me as I want

00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,359
to explore these questions of critical

00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:21,379
thinking by using a personal hobby of

00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:24,560
mine cycling both road and mountain bike

00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:27,259
for the record as well as of course our

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,590
most well known project here at the

00:03:27,259 --> 00:03:34,389
wikimedia foundation wikipedia don't

00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:37,939
worry you don't need to read the slide

00:03:34,389 --> 00:03:40,099
in case you aren't familiar with us here

00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:43,220
at the foundation some quick fun facts

00:03:40,099 --> 00:03:46,729
about our little slice of the world we

00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:50,810
serve up over 50 million plus articles

00:03:46,729 --> 00:03:52,699
across some 300 languages chances are if

00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:56,810
you're listening to this there is a

00:03:52,699 --> 00:04:01,930
wikipedia in your language in april

00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:03,469
alone we had 26 billion page views and

00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:07,310
53 million

00:04:03,469 --> 00:04:08,919
edits from around the globe and all of

00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:12,439
those are of course really cool stats

00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:14,629
perhaps but perhaps the most amazing

00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:17,690
thing about us from a tech standpoint is

00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:20,349
as a top 10 global site we are

00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:24,860
incredibly efficient at doing this

00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:27,289
requiring just 2200 servers across five

00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,800
data centers and trust me now that I've

00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:30,620
seen

00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:32,720
behind the hood here that is incredibly

00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:36,440
efficient even though it feels like a

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,539
big number but enough about us let's get

00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,960
back to our question on critical

00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:40,960
thinking

00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:49,009
to explore this question by going back

00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:51,210
to our cycling English Wikipedia page

00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:52,830
despite this being a topic that is

00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:55,979
relatively straightforward on the

00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:58,919
surface after all it's a bicycle the

00:04:55,979 --> 00:05:02,639
page itself covers everything from the

00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:04,740
basic to the incredibly rich as one

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:09,389
might expect if you've ever perused

00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:11,970
Wikipedia it covers different bikes like

00:05:09,389 --> 00:05:16,770
the unicycle which I've always wanted to

00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:21,000
learn to ride hey fun for the whole

00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:22,409
family to recumbents which combined two

00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,090
of my favorite things

00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:29,460
biking and reclining it even has a

00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,259
disambiguation link to my favorite team

00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:35,069
sport

00:05:30,259 --> 00:05:38,460
ice hockey no surprise when you dig into

00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:42,840
this the community engagement is also

00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:45,629
incredibly robust this page has been

00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:48,330
edited nearly 2500 times and it's not

00:05:45,629 --> 00:05:51,330
even anywhere near the top of our most

00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:55,650
edited pages and it's been edited by

00:05:51,330 --> 00:06:02,729
approximately 1300 editors with the last

00:05:55,650 --> 00:06:05,460
edit happening just last week where it

00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:07,650
gets a bit more interesting with just a

00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:11,580
few clicks we can get into some of our

00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:15,870
world's most pressing concerns topics

00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:18,569
like air pollution or medical topics

00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:21,950
like arthritis and cycling's effects on

00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:23,420
it of course we

00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:26,510
also touch on social and political

00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:31,130
movements like critical mass and a

00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:34,690
cyclist right to be on the road which of

00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:38,630
course leads to much deeper reading on

00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:41,270
strategies for political activism in

00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:43,130
some ways we've now come full circle to

00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:46,430
my opening reflection on where we are in

00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:52,030
the world but in reality you're probably

00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:55,730
wondering so what all I really did there

00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:59,600
was demonstrate we as Hugh's Tim

00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:02,810
berners-lee magical little invention we

00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:06,110
called the Wow we clicked a few links we

00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:09,050
browsed through some pages in essence

00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:11,360
most of the critical thinking here was

00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:14,570
done by the contributors up front as

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,780
they decided what links to include as

00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:21,440
they decided what's relevant to a topic

00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:24,530
and how to organize it well I wasn't

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,900
completely passive and that I chose what

00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:29,600
to click based on my own personal

00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:32,300
curiosity I'd have to do a lot of

00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,960
additional work to inject my own

00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:38,180
critical thinking into the process

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,100
perhaps by asking questions like what

00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:43,190
else should I be thinking about related

00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:46,760
to a mass what are the pros and cons of

00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:50,270
direct action political activism what do

00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:53,510
experts say about the physics of a bike

00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:55,550
or about air pollution and then of

00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:59,600
course I would have to go do the

00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:02,900
requisite searching browsing refining

00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:06,080
that is all too familiar to all of us as

00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:12,960
users of Wikipedia and search engines

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:16,139
like Google but of course

00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,479
bore through this story a lot more I

00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:20,729
want to dig in on what's going on behind

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,729
the scenes a little bit with you both

00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:24,590
from a contributors point of view and

00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:28,470
from errs

00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:31,169
how does Wikipedia do this work puts

00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:36,000
together the millions of articles that

00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:38,099
you and others read every single article

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,200
on our site is written by individual

00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:45,270
volunteers working alone or together

00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:47,700
each contribution involves summarizing

00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:49,350
sources and evaluating different

00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,720
perspectives in order to present the

00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:54,810
most comprehensive and neutral

00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:57,750
perspective on any topic whether that's

00:08:54,810 --> 00:09:02,900
celebrity biographies or current affairs

00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:05,310
or historical events by its very nature

00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:09,630
collaborative editing encourages people

00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:12,300
to consider other viewpoints Wikipedia

00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:15,390
is better because of the fact that

00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:19,650
editors disagree I'll touch on this more

00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:22,680
later it forces us to question why we

00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:25,830
think a topic should be represented in a

00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:29,220
certain way of course our editors rely

00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:31,920
on things like secondary sources they

00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,860
cite open access journals they work with

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:38,100
libraries to add more references as they

00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:39,930
improve and build articles from a

00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,730
Wikipedia article you can click to

00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:44,520
navigate the citations to great

00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:47,310
journalism the collections of some of

00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:50,339
the world's leading museums and archives

00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:56,130
and of course you can access the latest

00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:59,000
research in open access science because

00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:02,490
Wikipedia is written by the world we are

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,600
also of course a reflection of its

00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:12,390
biases we have a ton of articles about

00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:15,990
Europe about military history and about

00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:17,850
man that is reflective not only of the

00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:20,700
interests of people who currently edit

00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:22,770
Wikipedia but it's also the sort of

00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:25,880
information historically considered

00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:31,250
worthy and I emphasize historic

00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:33,290
considered worthy of being Ingo pedia we

00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:35,899
also still struggle with finding and

00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:40,459
rooting out actors with malicious intent

00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:44,899
or who are out for personal corporate or

00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:48,709
political gain Wikipedia is by no means

00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:53,060
perfect in fact the more we know what is

00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:57,050
in Wikipedia the more we know what is

00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:58,970
missing so that's a little bit about the

00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:03,139
content on Wikipedia and the people

00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:05,480
behind it what about the users all of

00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:09,560
you in the audience the people who read

00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:16,459
pedia who check it as their main source

00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:18,440
of information on any given topic here's

00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:21,860
the thing perhaps it's not all that

00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:26,529
surprising but despite all of the work

00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:29,630
our editors do to organize that content

00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:33,259
users often have their own agenda on our

00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:37,130
site just as I'm sure they do on your

00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:39,649
site our users we routinely create their

00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:43,600
own desire paths their own herd pass

00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:47,930
their own navigation through our content

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:51,189
whether we want them to or not it's

00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:58,550
almost as if our users know something

00:11:51,189 --> 00:12:00,680
that we as curators don't know we see

00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:03,680
this behavior throughout our experience

00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:05,540
here for example one of the things we've

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:08,269
been working on on our research team

00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:11,569
here at the foundation is mapping out

00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:14,420
our topic spaces and then overlaying it

00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:19,009
with our anonymized yes I'll repeat

00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:22,069
anonymized user session behavior one of

00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:25,930
the things you quickly see is there are

00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:29,259
both very focused browsing sessions and

00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:31,910
less focused browsing sessions

00:12:29,259 --> 00:12:35,809
additionally many of our users also go

00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:37,100
back out to our search or to sites like

00:12:35,809 --> 00:12:41,360
Google or

00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:44,600
go and come back in as well to re-engage

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:49,100
with topics along different vectors

00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:51,440
different lines of thinking interesting

00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:53,810
enough this type of behavior also

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,540
depends on the topics that users are

00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:58,670
searching for for instance our team has

00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:01,670
also found that users reading stem

00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:05,300
articles science technology engineering

00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:09,130
and math are often very much gonna get

00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:11,930
in get your information and get out mode

00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:15,980
where as users reading us about culture

00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:23,090
based topics spread out more to cover a

00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:25,700
variety of different topics guess what

00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:28,460
and I'm not bursting your bubble here

00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:32,690
but I think this user behavior is also

00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:35,600
spilling over at the societal level we

00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:39,050
see this in the rise of privacy first

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:42,200
search engines like go for chat apps

00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:45,170
like telegram we see it in new laws like

00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:47,720
GD P R or even the greater awareness of

00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:50,890
things like end-to-end encryption in the

00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:54,290
context of applications like zoom and

00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:57,320
slack in our messaging platforms and of

00:13:54,290 --> 00:14:00,860
course we see these same questions in

00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:07,490
the neverending debate around Facebook's

00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:10,850
use of data it all begs the question in

00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:16,970
my mind what is our responsibility here

00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:19,550
as technologists I'd like to share with

00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:23,420
you for a moment how my thinking has

00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:27,710
evolved on this subject and then how it

00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:30,980
leads to the crux of this idea around

00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:34,040
critical thinking like many of you I

00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:36,770
suspect I got into tech because it was a

00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:39,740
ton of fun to work and solve really hard

00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:42,320
problems on this infinite landscape that

00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:44,900
is a computer and the Internet

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:48,920
and of course I'd be lying if I didn't

00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:49,480
say the pay is pretty good too once I

00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,850
discover

00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:54,970
search and open-source and distributed

00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:57,910
systems it only further amplified that

00:14:54,970 --> 00:15:01,990
joy I got from problem-solving as my

00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:03,870
career grew alongside the growth of the

00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:06,370
Internet

00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:08,260
throwing natural language processing and

00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:11,290
machine learning and I felt like it was

00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:18,910
in engineering heaven perhaps you all

00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:20,889
can relate until the doubt started it

00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:24,160
first creeped in at the dawn of the big

00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:28,000
data era and the explosion of ad tech

00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:32,589
intra ad tracking tech and it grew

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:35,860
louder the more I engaged with it don't

00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:37,839
get me wrong I fully participated in

00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:40,180
this movement I've stood on stages like

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:43,660
this one in fact I've done it when

00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:46,360
buzzwords mean about the opportunity is

00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:49,720
through of applications and the handing

00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:52,750
of users and their desires through datum

00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,970
I mean natural language processing and

00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:58,540
of course the big buzzword of all

00:15:54,970 --> 00:16:02,199
artificial intelligence but I could

00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:06,430
never quite shake the doubt that there

00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:08,440
has to be more to it is waged that doubt

00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:11,470
by telling myself I wouldn't work in

00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:16,420
industries that don't align with my

00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:20,350
values but the doubt persisted there has

00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:22,180
to be something more the thing is I

00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:25,029
still believe in the incredible

00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:27,670
opportunity we have in front of us to

00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:30,699
use computers and data to progress

00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:32,410
ourselves and I still believe private

00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:35,310
companies have the right to collect data

00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:39,930
as long as their terms of use are clear

00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:42,490
well understood and respect our privacy

00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:45,040
but had to ask myself some pretty hard

00:16:42,490 --> 00:16:49,000
questions many of them centered around

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:56,500
is there a way to bring these seemingly

00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:59,140
competing things together and I think

00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,670
there is I think we

00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:04,870
opportunity you might even say a

00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:09,299
critical opportunity in front of us we

00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:12,579
have chance to raise the discourse and

00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:16,420
understanding online while still selling

00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:19,209
our wares in our eyeballs doing our

00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:24,220
searches all of the things that we as

00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:27,490
technologists like to do I believe we

00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:31,210
have a chance to enable more critical

00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:33,970
thinking online we are at a point in our

00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:38,679
time as technologists scratch that as

00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:41,830
humans help people make better use of

00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:45,340
our information to understand the

00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:48,960
nuances of information to make more

00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:52,150
informed decisions and more informed

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:56,530
opinions not just whatever comes to mind

00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:59,350
in the moment I believe our users are

00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:03,309
already telling us that they want this

00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:08,350
their behavior shows it and yet most

00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:10,450
sites do little to encourage it well I

00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:13,750
think it can often be attributed simply

00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:16,630
to lack of awareness I do also think

00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:22,120
it's often due to our desire to funnel

00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:25,090
people in to specific actions this leads

00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:31,500
me to believe we need a new paradigm for

00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:31,500
content creation curation and readership

00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:37,720
we need one that aligns with matching

00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:39,070
all of the information needs of users

00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,780
and for those of you and your out in the

00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:42,340
audience especially you have studied

00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,530
search I think you really know what I'm

00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,780
talking here about when you really think

00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:49,450
about all of the information needs we

00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:51,490
have not just those that are very

00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:53,950
tactical in the moment not just those

00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:57,850
that are designed for QA systems like

00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:59,980
Alexa our search systems like Google we

00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:04,480
have to find ways to get beyond that

00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:06,429
quick snackable content we need to

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,830
recognize that are you spending a lot

00:19:06,429 --> 00:19:13,029
more time than we give them credit for

00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:15,819
looking for information trying to dice

00:19:13,029 --> 00:19:18,759
to understand we have to get past the

00:19:15,819 --> 00:19:21,879
session based on analytics that drive so

00:19:18,759 --> 00:19:25,509
much of our behavior and look beyond we

00:19:21,879 --> 00:19:28,119
have to recognize that our users want to

00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:35,919
build a deeper understanding and they

00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:38,049
want to do it faster we reflect back

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:41,139
you'll also come to the conclusion that

00:19:38,049 --> 00:19:44,919
we as humans over a thousands of years

00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:48,669
have built many constructs for critical

00:19:44,919 --> 00:19:53,249
thinking maybe not always in the most

00:19:48,669 --> 00:19:57,009
inclusive way but a help but feel like

00:19:53,249 --> 00:20:00,489
we're here are letting those gains slip

00:19:57,009 --> 00:20:03,759
away online as we push people to find

00:20:00,489 --> 00:20:06,929
their tribe or we funnel them to meet

00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:10,989
our analytics goals or our sales goals

00:20:06,929 --> 00:20:13,449
we recognize that we as builders of

00:20:10,989 --> 00:20:15,459
these large tech platforms have

00:20:13,449 --> 00:20:20,169
forgotten about the social constructs

00:20:15,459 --> 00:20:21,939
that encourage critical thinking the

00:20:20,169 --> 00:20:24,899
Wikipedia movement has built many of

00:20:21,939 --> 00:20:28,389
these constructs into the movement

00:20:24,899 --> 00:20:33,579
stum through software but most through

00:20:28,389 --> 00:20:36,429
people policies assisi's per se with

00:20:33,579 --> 00:20:39,849
ideas like trying to achieve a neutral

00:20:36,429 --> 00:20:42,909
point of view or fact-based reasoning or

00:20:39,849 --> 00:20:45,939
consensus building or verifiability

00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:51,599
or perhaps our most cherished that

00:20:45,939 --> 00:20:51,599
everyone has the right to knowledge

00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:56,450
here's the really cool thing about these

00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:59,510
social constructs the community here at

00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:02,540
Wikipedia has built and by the way keep

00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:05,150
in mind and honor to this movement I'm

00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:09,500
still learning there's so much to learn

00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:13,720
and knowing knows how this 20 year old

00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:17,030
meant by Del's and Larry Sanger it works

00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:21,110
but there are a few engine bits I want

00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:23,060
to have you take away first there was a

00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:26,410
recent study publisher Business Review

00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:29,870
that showed that when people with skins

00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:32,270
contribute to Wikipedia their

00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:34,850
contributions and perhaps I like to

00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:39,410
think hopefully I like to think their

00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:44,500
views get more neutral over time Pete

00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:47,030
that they get more neutral over time a

00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:50,840
second study attempted to quantify just

00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:55,090
how much diverse there's coming to the

00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:59,480
conclusion that the site's most dead

00:21:55,090 --> 00:22:01,840
much of verdicts tend to also be of much

00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,840
higher quality

00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:09,910
when was the last time you heard either

00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:16,310
of those kinds of said about behaviors

00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:17,300
online in 2020 this feels almost like an

00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:25,400
impossible dream

00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:26,990
and yet it's happening in fact I think

00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:31,220
it's just the opposite of an Impala

00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:35,150
dream I think we as a group actually

00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:38,660
have many of the tools and skills in

00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:41,270
place to enable this deeper and richer

00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:45,080
engagement with our content and each

00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:48,080
other and I believe we can do right by

00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:50,330
all the social constructs developed over

00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:53,810
all the years that encourage critical

00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:56,960
thinking while putting a modern spin on

00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:58,670
them that also makes room for so many of

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,450
the voices that have been traditionally

00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:03,639
shut out

00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:05,649
think about it we have tools like search

00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:08,259
and recommendation engines for servicing

00:23:05,649 --> 00:23:10,659
content to users what would it look like

00:23:08,259 --> 00:23:13,509
if we tweaked our scoring algorithms for

00:23:10,659 --> 00:23:16,710
diversity of results when we detected

00:23:13,509 --> 00:23:21,039
exploratory invent intense on

00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:22,929
controversial topics we also have

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:26,259
natural language processing models for

00:23:22,929 --> 00:23:29,129
identifying related topics as well as

00:23:26,259 --> 00:23:32,049
topic bringing different perspectives

00:23:29,129 --> 00:23:35,230
what if we fed those into our feeds

00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:37,539
piece by piece instead of the usual

00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:41,169
fodder that reinforces our belief

00:23:37,539 --> 00:23:43,299
systems we also have crawlers that can

00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:45,940
harvest the entire web and build

00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:48,580
authoritative algorithms like PageRank

00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:51,399
and of course we have analytics

00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:54,700
capabilities oh do we have analytics

00:23:51,399 --> 00:23:57,370
capabilities for identifying all these

00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:01,870
user journeys and testing out these

00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:04,779
hypotheses yet there are still many open

00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:06,759
questions especially on the social

00:24:04,779 --> 00:24:10,240
construct side but here's where I think

00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:14,519
some of the Wikipedia values can

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:18,549
actually help us on the technology side

00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:21,250
for start we might ask ourselves how

00:24:18,549 --> 00:24:24,909
might we use this no Valatie on our

00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:27,610
platforms first off I do want to note

00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:30,159
here that for us a neutral point of view

00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:33,429
doesn't mean our community of volunteers

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:36,039
don't try to understand and represent

00:24:33,429 --> 00:24:37,840
multiple sides of the story nor do I

00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:40,200
want to represent that even some of

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:44,320
those feel very strongly about of

00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:47,169
particular one of those sides but it

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:50,230
does mean they have a commitment to try

00:24:47,169 --> 00:24:55,210
to present those sides in a neutral

00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:57,940
unbiased way how might we use this on

00:24:55,210 --> 00:25:00,519
other platforms I might we use things

00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:03,580
like text classification to recognize

00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:06,370
content that would benefit from other

00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:09,369
viewpoints how might we use it to help

00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:10,440
people better flesh out their side of an

00:25:09,369 --> 00:25:11,650
argument

00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,420
how am I

00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:17,560
we use it to help people see the other

00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:19,630
aspects of a problem perhaps most

00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,970
importantly how do we do this without

00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:29,560
taking away our users creativity and

00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:32,770
freedom of expression neutrality feeds

00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:35,380
on consensus one of the interesting

00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:38,380
aspects of Wikipedia one that I didn't

00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:41,350
quite get at first is that everyone sees

00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:44,380
the same article on any given topic

00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:46,390
there's some nuance there there's no

00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:49,750
customized content for someone who's a

00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:52,720
fan of bikes from track versus giant for

00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:56,470
example because there is only one

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:59,440
article our editors have an incentive to

00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:02,740
come to consensus they must edit this

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,530
one article on a topic therefore they

00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:08,500
must find a way to reconcile their

00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:12,010
different perspectives emphasize a

00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:15,780
neutral point of view and to decide what

00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:18,250
information to include in the article

00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:20,290
for many of you coming here from open

00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:23,370
source this perhaps is nothing new at a

00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:25,720
social level probably isn't something

00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:28,870
you've thought about building into your

00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,820
tack other than perhaps at the really

00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:33,880
low level of things like consensus

00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:36,370
algorithms like Paxos in our distributed

00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,930
systems where we have to build consensus

00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:42,100
in order to make sure the machines are

00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:43,690
up let me ask the question what might it

00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,730
look like for you to build in your

00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:47,470
system using tools like collaborative

00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:50,680
filtering or other recommendation

00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:53,470
engines to devise consensus on your

00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:55,810
platform maybe it's not obvious at first

00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:58,360
depending on where what your platform

00:26:55,810 --> 00:27:01,080
does but I bet there are ways that you

00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,080
can do it

00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:11,260
right now a lot of work goes into

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:14,260
verifying content on sites not just what

00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:16,870
I'm sure yours or the fact-checking

00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:18,940
politicians or figure out whether

00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:22,420
something is this some shin or

00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:24,370
disinformation in fact active

00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,830
disinformation campaigns are making it

00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:32,400
even different

00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:35,160
for us to know is true we as

00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:38,610
technologists we need to find a way to

00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:42,600
build verifiability into our user

00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:44,960
generated content systems we need a ways

00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:48,090
to customs can mark content as

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:52,830
unverified and on top of that we need a

00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:56,400
way that our users accept and try to do

00:27:52,830 --> 00:28:00,540
something about and not just try to

00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:02,250
legislate it away I wish I answer for

00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:04,890
this one but I asked the question how

00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:06,960
might we use all of our content

00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:10,020
harvesting systems like our fancy

00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:13,170
crawlers and our deepening model even

00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:15,630
sites like Wikipedia and we to better

00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:19,260
know what is credible

00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:26,610
what is verifiable and what is trust

00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:30,150
work now all of these ice in my mind

00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:34,130
really point to a need for a better set

00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:36,960
of open transparent verifiable

00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:39,260
moderation tools it's interesting when I

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:43,470
talk to my peers at other user-generated

00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:46,290
content sites they to express this same

00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:49,410
need for better moderation tools how do

00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:52,170
we help our users better care for our

00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:54,840
sites they want tools that can be used

00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:58,410
across platforms so that we'd all don't

00:28:54,840 --> 00:29:02,700
have to reinvent the wheel we want tools

00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:05,660
that build in like spam control some of

00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:09,060
the most features we've taught today

00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:13,170
tools that allow communities to easily

00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:17,270
describe manage update and enforce their

00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:20,640
values tools the privacy preserving

00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:24,120
community controlled governances at

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:27,150
their heart most of all we need tools

00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:31,950
that enable critical thinking encourage

00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:34,200
us to be better forms of ourselves one

00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:35,850
such way we are doing this here at the

00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,550
foundation and in the community is

00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:41,190
through the creation of a system we

00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:43,530
called Jade I'll link it up at the end

00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:46,650
for you all that is designed to capture

00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:49,020
the label data that we all know is so

00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:51,590
important Xin learning algorithms but

00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:54,840
we're doing it at a very Wikipedia way

00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:58,200
not only does it allow us to capture the

00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:00,240
usual annotations that many of you in

00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:03,090
the audience are familiar with when

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,510
building training and test sets for our

00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:09,690
machine learning algorithms but it also

00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:13,500
allows our community to register

00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:17,790
disagreements to decide on a best label

00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:21,590
and to make improvements over time just

00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:25,860
do when improving articles through pages

00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:27,930
revisions and reverts our hope is that

00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:30,480
Jade will play a critical role in

00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:33,300
helping our community track the trends

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:37,560
and biases in the machine learning

00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:40,140
models we host for them by making sure

00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:42,540
that Wikipedians have the final say over

00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:46,370
the data we use to train and evaluate

00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:49,400
models in many ways we are giving them a

00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:57,960
powerful tool to govern the algorithm

00:30:49,400 --> 00:31:00,360
manage on their behalf why does this

00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:04,169
ability to enable critical thinking

00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:07,409
matter perhaps it feels

00:31:04,169 --> 00:31:10,499
just too hard but beyond I think beyond

00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:13,139
the obvious societal gains more informed

00:31:10,499 --> 00:31:16,080
decision makers and a more informed

00:31:13,139 --> 00:31:19,769
electorate electorate practically

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:22,590
speaking I think it leads to deeper

00:31:19,769 --> 00:31:25,230
engagement and loyalty as users are able

00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:28,249
to make more informed decisions whether

00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:33,690
they are those are in what they buy

00:31:28,249 --> 00:31:36,149
spend their time or who they vote for we

00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:39,149
had a lot of work ahead of us and it

00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:40,919
won't be easy but I trust we can go

00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:44,460
further and faster

00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:49,350
the sooner we burst our bubbles and get

00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:51,600
our users out of their bubbles due to

00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:54,210
leave you with a few resources on how we

00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:58,789
might engage on this and then of course

00:31:54,210 --> 00:32:01,230
I'm happy to answer a few questions of

00:31:58,789 --> 00:32:06,989
course make sure we have these links

00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:09,629
available beyond that I want to thank

00:32:06,989 --> 00:32:11,700
you for your time and I hope you enjoy

00:32:09,629 --> 00:32:17,489
the rest of your comp rest of the

00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:19,710
conference a grant I'm Josh I'm here in

00:32:17,489 --> 00:32:22,109
Berlin with buzzwords crew and I have a

00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:24,509
few questions and comments on the slack

00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:28,769
channel so the first one comes from

00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:33,090
Matteo and he asks is no bias equal to

00:32:28,769 --> 00:32:35,730
neutrality so he's further asks also to

00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:41,100
see some changes in society is in some

00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:44,129
degree of polarity necessary that's a

00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:49,489
great question and a very deep enriched

00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:53,850
topic I don't the Wikipedia community

00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:56,580
tries to get rid of bias completely in

00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:59,340
or or think through that there are

00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:02,059
multiple points of view I think in fact

00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:07,679
if you just bring back up our resources

00:33:02,059 --> 00:33:09,749
here and we share that I think if you

00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,580
read like so under the Jade a neutral

00:33:09,749 --> 00:33:13,649
point of view bullets towards the ends

00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:15,599
of this it's interesting they've

00:33:13,649 --> 00:33:17,030
actually codified quite a bit what

00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:19,100
neutral point of view mean

00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:21,200
and it it does not mean that we try to

00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:24,140
get everything to just be this one

00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,900
perfect no biased view what they try to

00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:29,300
then do instead is represent all of the

00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:31,160
different views or at least many of them

00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:33,230
and so to be able to compare and

00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:35,510
contrast it's interesting they've also

00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:40,160
developed kind of subtlety and nuance

00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:42,800
that is designed to give way to ones

00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:46,190
that are more commonly accepted so as to

00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:48,310
not you know necessarily be by a school

00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:51,710
the Fringe ideas or what some people

00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:54,440
interview or not am by no means an

00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:57,290
expert here but I I do think you know to

00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:59,480
the to the the first of the question

00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:01,910
there isn't need to have some of that

00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:04,790
tension the real question then and the

00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:07,490
critical thinking approach is how do we

00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:09,290
then resolve those tensions how do we

00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:11,380
get past those how do we build up

00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:14,360
constructs that allow us to have more

00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:17,200
constructive debates as opposed to just

00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:20,330
everybody going into their camp like now

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:23,690
so it's a great question on a related

00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:26,240
subject and so this question for me how

00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:27,440
do you deal with not only biases and

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,480
communities but communities that really

00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,280
gang up on each other in a way and we

00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:34,490
see this right now and a lot of the

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,570
political debates and is there a way you

00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:38,890
know when we think about bias and

00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:41,990
machine learning biases effectively the

00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:44,780
the information that is not knowable by

00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:47,750
the machine so how do we deal with this

00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:49,850
being able to detect this how do we

00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:52,190
trust certain communities communities of

00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:56,659
editors how are you thinking about these

00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:59,540
types of topics at Wikipedia yeah is a

00:34:56,659 --> 00:35:00,800
hard problem I think you know there's a

00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:04,450
lot of work in the communities around

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:07,700
governance it certainly does

00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:10,520
individuals biases and of course as I

00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:14,720
mentioned earlier on one of the earlier

00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:16,550
slides it stood up yeah very real ways

00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,500
there's been another number of studies

00:35:16,550 --> 00:35:23,560
around things like the gender gap on

00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:26,030
Wikipedia and representation for

00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,950
traditionally been underrepresented it

00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:30,610
because history hasn't told their

00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:34,030
stories there's therefore

00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:38,560
a sizable references but there's a lot

00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:41,140
of working forward those stories and

00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:44,980
make them sizable and and bowling

00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:46,960
encyclopedia way gone for instance the

00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:48,790
main way most articles that get

00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,820
discussed you could go to any Wikipedia

00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:55,120
page you'll see a discussion tab or

00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:57,580
what's called page internally some of

00:35:55,120 --> 00:36:00,210
those talk pages in fact can be quite

00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:03,490
enlightening they can also be quite

00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:08,050
toxic and so I think you know we have to

00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:10,780
recognize as all points that we have to

00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:12,790
make space to listen for them and then

00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:15,910
come to our own opinions and and own

00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:18,550
hopefully informed opinions I do think

00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:20,290
you know perhaps Wikipedia is has some

00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:23,940
things going for it like I mentioned

00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:26,800
here and that at the end of the day

00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:29,650
there's one page right it's not somebody

00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,830
spins off and says here other that has

00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:37,090
my right like the community will cease

00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:39,760
that building it consists in the

00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:42,280
volunteer community and have been

00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,850
thoroughly debated for a year or so I

00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:47,500
think you know we have to find ways to

00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:50,770
to provide that governance as we go

00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:53,320
forward and I suspect there's ways

00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:58,450
machine learning can help I don't fully

00:36:53,320 --> 00:37:04,960
know if they can we have enough evidence

00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:07,810
that we recognize when it's happening it

00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:11,770
reminds me I think SuperFlow I believe

00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:14,500
published a blog post on one of the

00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:17,470
things they did on stood back over but

00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:20,410
the unfriendly PBOT I think you can just

00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:22,600
search for that Stack Overflow and

00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:23,830
unfriendly bought what they did was they

00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:27,700
trained a machine learning by to

00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:29,470
recognize in users comments weren't

00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:32,590
particularly helpful for solving a

00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:36,250
problem found pretty quickly that when

00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:38,320
the people making the comments were told

00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:40,240
by the hey you probably could improve

00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,100
this you could probably make this more

00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,470
opening and welcome that the users

00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:46,210
actually did so I think

00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:48,970
could start with some of these more

00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:52,510
simple things and build and learn from

00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:54,970
those so maybe a good related question

00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:57,040
is Peter s is one of Wikimedia as goal

00:37:54,970 --> 00:38:01,810
is to become the barometer of opinion

00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:04,630
versus balance yeah I don't think we're

00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:07,690
well I I of course can't speak for the

00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:11,170
community there are a lot of people with

00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:12,970
a lot of opinions so are we meant to be

00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:16,990
the barometer of a pin oh I think our

00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:19,720
goal is to make sure that we have people

00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:22,720
have the right to free and open access

00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:24,760
to knowledge right and so I think our

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,180
our goal is to make sure that it is

00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:29,380
properly represented and served gets

00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,660
properly I'm not even sure if that's the

00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:34,000
right word but that knowledge has a

00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:38,380
place to live and is free and open to

00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,520
anyone in the world so there's a not so

00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:43,480
much of a question more of a comment

00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:45,160
from Sarah she says I agree with grant

00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,230
that it should be a goal to enable

00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:49,359
critical thinking at the same time there

00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:50,980
seems to be this almost unsolvable

00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,839
problem that we have masses of

00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:54,880
information available which is

00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:56,500
constantly coming in making it very hard

00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,080
to stay on top of an in-depth

00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,640
understanding of facts this is why we

00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:03,160
came up with text summarization for

00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,680
example if these methods though take

00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:08,109
away depth in favor of making the masses

00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:12,280
readable critical thinking could suffer

00:39:08,109 --> 00:39:14,020
what are your thoughts on that yeah for

00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,330
sure Sarah I think that's spot-on and I

00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:18,010
mean I think that's why you know I

00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:20,349
talked about like if you study

00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:24,910
information theory information retrieval

00:39:20,349 --> 00:39:27,190
etc you know there's often this bias

00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:29,170
towards the short the ten blue links the

00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:30,970
question-answering systems but if you

00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:33,250
actually you know and I've had this

00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:36,310
experience in Prior jobs you know as you

00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:38,170
actually dig into people's search

00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:41,790
behavior for instance you see them

00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:45,430
routinely coming back to a site around

00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:46,839
different you know viewpoints on a topic

00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:49,089
you even you know you see this at the

00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:51,760
e-commerce layer people search one day

00:39:49,089 --> 00:39:54,910
for a specific thing they forget about

00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:57,550
it they come back a week later again may

00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:59,430
different things they're doing that

00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:03,910
in gathering they're looking for

00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:06,850
alternatives they're looking for cheaper

00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:10,690
prices whatever it is right and I think

00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:12,730
you know it's recognizing that people

00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:17,350
have this need over time you know one of

00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:20,500
the fields in search that does this and

00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:22,090
sees this firsthand is ediscovery if

00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:25,000
you've ever spent any time in the

00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:28,540
ediscovery space you know that lawyers

00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:31,090
and legal scholars etc are often looking

00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:33,600
to gather all of the things that are on

00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:36,520
topic and they have to wade through

00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:39,640
thousands these days millions of pieces

00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:42,550
of content to find you know the smoking

00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:45,190
gun the defense whatever it is that

00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:48,190
helps serve their case and so they have

00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:50,740
to think across time same goes for

00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:53,170
things like PhD students etc and I saw

00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:55,300
part of my challenge here for all of us

00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:59,380
is like how do we think about better

00:40:55,300 --> 00:41:02,080
ways to capture and learn from our users

00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:04,810
over time beyond just the very tactical

00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:07,420
10 blue links or even beyond just the

00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:10,330
session and the query rewriting that

00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:12,970
many of us are so focused on right those

00:41:10,330 --> 00:41:16,710
are of course valid we still need those

00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:19,360
very quick snackable to settle a bet or

00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:22,030
I'll find out what the price of a widget

00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:25,150
is we also have these broader needs

00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:27,820
across time and I think we are doing a

00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:32,530
disservice if we don't spend at least

00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:35,650
some time on those types of problems so

00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:38,200
Peter is hosting I believe a talk later

00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:40,030
this week on Thursday about diversifying

00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,970
search results and this was brought up

00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:44,640
in this talk so if anyone's interested

00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:47,080
feel free to check out that talk as well

00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:49,600
there was another question about search

00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:51,280
relevancy at Wikipedia so effectively

00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:54,850
how is it handled so especially given

00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:58,000
that users are usually not logged in to

00:41:54,850 --> 00:42:01,810
Wikipedia itself and there's no tracking

00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:03,970
no personal data involved how at a high

00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:07,710
level if you can in a nutshell how does

00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:07,710
relevance work media

00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:14,650
no I share on its flight it is funny for

00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:16,480
being somebody who's coming from the

00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:19,150
search space to the interesting thing

00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:22,030
for me was I think I've been here just

00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:26,980
now and search is probably the area I've

00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:29,050
I've spent my my take was that hey it's

00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:31,330
pretty well there certainly are some

00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:34,390
areas of improvement that we are working

00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:36,640
on surround image search and things like

00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:39,220
that but for the most part it's been

00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:43,120
working especially for the more popular

00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:46,410
sites so we sought a time on some of the

00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:49,390
underserved search communities our

00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:52,120
search team has blogged fairly

00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:55,000
extensively about search in fact one of

00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:59,730
our computational linguists just put up

00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:04,470
a post about processing income here as a

00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:07,000
language for search so all that to say

00:43:04,470 --> 00:43:08,860
digging in a little bit the things I do

00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,820
know about and certainly half provides

00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:15,370
some links we have a fairly large

00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:19,600
elasticsearch cluster across multiple

00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:23,320
nodes we are using learning to rank

00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:27,520
plugins quite extensively a number of

00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:29,860
the sites we use anonymous user behavior

00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:34,690
queries logging all that kind of stuff

00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:39,220
to get at the the best relevance for our

00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:44,770
topics we don't have a query intent in

00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:47,410
place yet we let's see what else we do

00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:50,500
some light session analysis again on on

00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:52,960
an anonymized behavior we do have a be

00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:54,790
testing capabilities in our search

00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,250
engine so if you've ever heard me talk

00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:59,680
about things like learning to rank or a

00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:04,420
be testing we do have many of those

00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:08,890
things in place let's see what else like

00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:10,930

00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:13,750

00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:17,290
in support search across some 300

00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:20,290
languages so and we have contributed a

00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:21,420
number I believe of improvements back to

00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:23,900
