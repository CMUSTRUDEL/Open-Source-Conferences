We know open source software, hardware and data are good, but sometimes they are also implemented and utilised for good purposes.

Amanda will talk about some of her experiences in tech, particularly Open technology being used to bank the unbanked and democratise poverty through various projects including implementation of open payment platforms, her work as Chair of the UN Technology Innovation Labs Open Source and IP Advisory and setting up the disaster response tools, Open Tech Response.

a real pleasure to be here with you um

00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,920
i think nina asked me i can't remember

00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,520
it was december or january to come to

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,559

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,879
and originally i was going to be

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,640
keynoting on monday morning

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,320
and i have to say i was pretty much

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,600
looking forward to a weekend in berlin

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,159
coming to the conference

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,600
hanging out with all of you guys and

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,360
this was going to be the biggest week of

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,560
my year this was also going to be open

00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,960
uk week

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,240
and as deb said my main role in open

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:23,200
source these days

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:26,080
is that i am the ceo of open uk

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,520
um i'm going to talk to you about open

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,200
for good but i'm going to start by

00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,079
giving you a bit of context about open

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,520
uk

00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,680
i don't know if it's an organization

00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,240
many of you will have heard of

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,799
and open uk has existed for a while but

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,439
really

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,680
only sort of started to shine its light

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,720
in the last six months

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,799
and we are an advocacy and industry

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,040
organization across the uk

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,320
for open source technology or open

00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,040
technology

00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,159
and our vision is to develop and sustain

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,200
uk leadership

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,119
in open technology now for many of you

00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,759
you may not have heard those two words

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,439
together

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,960
or if you have you may have only heard

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,320
them recently or not very often

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,079
and it's something that's definitely

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,720
worth paying attention to because i

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:11,840
think it's very much the future of open

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,560
and for us at open uk we've defined open

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,160
technology

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,160
and we've defined it as open source

00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,720
software open hardware

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,400
and open data and of course at this

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,280
point in time of innovation and

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,959
development

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,120
bringing those three together is

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,520
critical i think we're probably the

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,560
first organization to formalize that in

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,319
our vision

00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,239
but i also believe that you will see

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,599
many more organizations doing something

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,680
similar

00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,040
and we we create that vision as a

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,800
reality

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:43,599
using the three key areas three

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,480
three pillars of open and those are

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,200
community

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,720
legal and policy and education i'm just

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,040
going to talk a little bit about what

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,440
each of those mean for us

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,760
so in terms of community we're trying to

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,319
build a really visible and loud open

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:02,159
community across the uk

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,840
and uh what we found unsurprisingly and

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,560
you probably see this in your own

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,760
geographic

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,800
areas is that we're not necessarily

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,360
terribly joined up by geography

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,040
within the open communities most of us

00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,840
if you're anything like me or the people

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,760
i know

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,519
will have worked in projects where we

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,680
really enjoy the international

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,040
collaborations that we do and we work

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,799
with people all over the globe and

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,879
that's important to us

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,239
and of course that should never change

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,400
but what we've discovered

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,000
is that often people work on projects

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,000
and know their um

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,680
colleagues on those projects but may not

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,840
know their neighbors

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,920
uh lockdown has been a revelation for me

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,560
in the uk and i've discovered that

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,080
a lady at microsoft who i i've actually

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,280
been working with in an open data

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,120
project

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,879
lives across the street from me

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,560
literally a hundred yards from me

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,159
and we've become prime friends through

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,159
lockdown so

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,760
what we want to do is build this

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,799
community as a strong

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,959
visible loud community across the uk

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,920
by engaging people and engaging them in

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,720
events

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,239
in our digital interactions through

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,239
different projects

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,480
and one way we were going to do that was

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,480
hosting open uk week which was to take

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,000
place as i said this week

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,799
i'll talk a little bit more about that

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,120
later but it's now moved to october

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,799
and like uh berlin buzzwords is mostly

00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,079
going to be online if not entirely

00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,400
online

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,080
the second area and we're actually very

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,680
strong in this one in the uk

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,440
is legal and policy

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,080
and we want to make sure that the uk

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,520
becomes a great place to do open

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:41,360
um we were really really pleased

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:43,360
that we were able to speak with the uk

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,520
trade international trade people back in

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,800
february now those people

00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,880
were negotiating and still are

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,080
negotiating all the replacement treaties

00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,199
being put in place

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,600
around the brexit exit from europe

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,199
so we were able to go and speak to them

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,240
and advise them and

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,400
guide them with respect to the use of

00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,039
source code provisions in those treaties

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,720
as they would

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:11,280
impact open source we also

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,639
review and monitor new legislation

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,639
currently still in europe

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,199
um we're still there at the end of the

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,800
year but also primarily in the uk and

00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,800
we're building engagements with uk

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,360
government to try and work more and more

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,160
on the

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,000
policies and practices and we've also

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,400
established within that legal and policy

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,919
group

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,520
something called future leaders and

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,160
that's something you might be interested

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,479
in

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,360
i think again we're the first to to have

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,520
created that

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,199
anywhere in the globe but what we've

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,160
done is we've realized that we're all

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,240
getting on a bit

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,919
so frankly we have a bunch of people in

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,479
this legal and policy group who are

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,919
really

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,360
established in open but we're all in our

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,039
40s and 50s

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,560
and we need to make sure the next

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,000
generation is going to come through and

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,600
carry on this work

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,199
no point in building something if it's

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,240
not sustainable right

00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,240
so what we've done is engage with

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,639
uh legal and policy people business

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,479
people we don't yet have developers but

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,280
we'd love to have some developers engage

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,600
in it

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,400
and we are mentoring them and leading

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,840
them through

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,479
a review of uk government terms when it

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,840
comes to

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:20,479
procurement that will impact open so ccs

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,479
gds and the nhs terms across the uk

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,840
we will produce a paper reviewing those

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,960
which will be written by the leaders of

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,039
that future leaders group

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,720
and we will host a seminar probably with

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,800
the open chain project

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,720
in the autumn with uk golf that group

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,560
needed some training and most of the

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,840
people involved know a bit about open

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,960
but they're learning and they want to

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,960
learn more

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,319
so what we did was pull together a few

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,000
training sessions

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:50,560
that um started i think in april

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,520
uh they're at noon every friday noon uk

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,680
every friday

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,960
uh you can get details of what's coming

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,440
up on open uk

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,960
dot uk events in our events calendar

00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,720
you'll see them

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,720
they are presented by leaders not just

00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,720
in the uk and europe but global leaders

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,120
and the open movement

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,919
we started with what you might expect

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,319
compliance

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,880
governance patents trademarks the really

00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,520
practical things that would impact

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,479
anybody with a support background around

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,800
open

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,520
and we've just flipped as of this week

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,759
into looking at some of the community

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,720
topics we start on friday with neil

00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,160
mcgovern

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,360
who as you probably know is the

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,000
executive director of the gnome

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,400
foundation

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,840
neil's talking about opening the desktop

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,720
we have jonathan riddle the next week

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,960
from kde

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,400
talking about apps and open and the week

00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,120
after we have matt

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,800
um jarvis talking about contribution to

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,840
community projects and that will go

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,879
on picking up hardware and data into the

00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,319
summer

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,240
we have a break in august and then we

00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,639
come back in september and we pivot to

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,720
the commercials so we talk about uh

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,039
business models we have people you will

00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:00,479
know uh like frank carlishak

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:04,400
um from nexcloud and

00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:06,240
uh rancher shane coughlin from open

00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,039
chain talking about the business side of

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,720
open

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,479
now i mentioned those a little bit more

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,639
length than you maybe would expect me to

00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,160
in a talk about open for good but i

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,639
would encourage you to take a look

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,960
they're free to attend anyone can attend

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,400
and they are available as recordings

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,840
afterwards

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,080
every time i watch one of them i learned

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,759
something new so that's the second

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,599
challenge the second tranche is legal in

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,560
policy which sits with building our

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,000
community

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,000
and then of course as a third piece

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,080
which is education and learning

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
and we focus that across primary

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,080
secondary and tertiary education

00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,680
we have a universities group who should

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,000
this week have had a three-day

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,039
posse professors open source software

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,200
education

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,160
that's a project run by google and red

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,640
hat in the us

00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,200
they were coming to the uk to do uh

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,399
training

00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,240
for our professors unfortunately i think

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,760
that's probably a face-to-face event

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,440
we've pushed it provisionally back to

00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,120
october could be next year

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,560
that group is also looking at across

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,680
student collaboration

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:05,440
um entering a competition and we then

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,959
have a secondary school

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:11,680
so ages 11 to 18 where we're focusing

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:14,320
on building a qualification an

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,560
educational exam qualification

00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,760
possibly something we call a gcse here

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,279
not definitely

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,000
we want to launch that by the end of

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:24,240
2022 it's all been stolen unfortunately

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,240
with the pandemic but that's something

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,160
that's very dear to my heart making sure

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,880
that we're not just educating kids and

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,760
how to

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,000
learn a language how to build in python

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,399
or

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,560
for a little kid scratch but actually

00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,560
teach them what open means

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,920
and we're also aware that many of the

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,920
best developers

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,600
are not focused on the traditional

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,560
educational routes you know they don't

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,560
find doing gcses or whatever the exams

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,240
conducive to their way of working so

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,959
we're working with a number of major

00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,440
companies

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,959
and with uh the education authorities to

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,839
try to build

00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:00,080
um an apprenticeship scheme where people

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,880
will learn on the job hands-on

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,160
how to be an open engineer and then i

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,519
guess finally we

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,200
we're looking at little kids and with

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,640
the little kids we're engaging with a

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,079
number of

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,720
organizations who are currently

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:14,640
providing code camps and the like

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,160
to take them a step further and actually

00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,000
teach kids

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,600
about what open means not just the

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,880
technologies

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:26,000
so um one of the the the many

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:29,120
many events that were impacted or victim

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,720
to the pandemic was the open uk kids

00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,320
competition

00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,800
this is something i was very proud of

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,480
and in fact i feel like i sweated blood

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,399
the first part of this year to get it in

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,360
place and then of course

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,880
along came coronavirus and off with my

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,680
my competition

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,320
um in short it was a competition

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,519
designed

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,399
for kids to build this

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:54,480
glove and then compete with each other

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,360
creating something that was

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,920
uh original and creative using the glove

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,800
uh which is a software glove

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,279
the glove was designed originally by the

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,200
singer

00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,760
imogen heap double grammy award-winning

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,680
singer imogen heap about 10 years ago

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,360
i worked with imaging on the prototype

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,760
and there was always an intention that

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,279
at least

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,040
aspects of it would be open and that's

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,200
what i was involved in

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,440
um the glove was picked up by aaron

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,079
grandy who toured about five years ago

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,360
with it

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,959
and last year this mini moo glove this

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,600
kit was released

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:30,079
now the glove is built the kids glove is

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:33,519
built on a micro bit a bbc micro bit

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:37,519
and that little board is used

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,880
to power the musical capacity of

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,240
the glove the glove can be used for

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,680
other things but primarily it's an

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,519
instrument

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,120
i'm really excited to say that the glove

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,000
has been open sourced as part of our

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,120
project

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,639
and you if you were to buy a kit

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,880
you would get all aspects but you can

00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:54,560
know if you happen to have a micro bit

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,079
download the instructions to build the

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,560
glove download the

00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,120
template to cut around your hand and

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,040
also

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,320
um you i think you still have to buy the

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,839
little speaker i don't think there's any

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,480
way of creating that little piece of

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,360
hardware

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,600
but it's inexpensive now the the idea

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,000
was that we were having kids competing

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,920
in teams of four each team sharing one

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,320
glove kit that we would thanks to red

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,560
hat sponsorship for giving the kids

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,560
and then we would bring winners to

00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:23,360
london this thursday

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,079
to have a code camp in the red hat

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,760
innovation

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,360
lab and then to compete with imogen heat

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,839
there to judge

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,680
obviously i cannot ask for kids to share

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,279
a glove anymore

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,120
i don't think many of their parents

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,320
would let me move them around the uk

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,839
this year let alone this week so we had

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,920
to let that go

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,959
but what we've done instead not to be

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,160
beaten by it

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,839
is create a smaller course

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,440
a smaller competition rather and an

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,839
additional course

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,760
so we have a competition taking place in

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,360
september

00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,680
the winners will be announced at the

00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,519
open uk awards they're part of open uk

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,560
week and they take place on the 20th of

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,639
october

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,680
if any of you are in the uk or no folk

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,760
in the uk

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,880
nominations have just been extended from

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,600
the from 9 to the 15th of june

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:17,040
right through to 30th june so you can

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,360
nominate people to participate

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,200
or to be considered for an award in open

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,120
source software hardware data

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,399
as an individual or a young person and

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,120
then of course there will be a kids

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,200
winner

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,279
and what we've done with the kids is not

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,000
just have this smaller competition

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,760
but also we are giving each child their

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,279
own gloves so they won't share

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,959
and we've sent those out to them over

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,320
the last week or so

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:43,680
and we've developed a 10 session

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,560
animated course on open so the first

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,519
session

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,399
is animated by the singer imogen heap

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,760
really brilliant

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,880
it looks wonderful um and imogen of

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,800
course is fabulous

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,320
uh very experienced and doing that kind

00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,680
of thing but what i like

00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,519
best about it is that we're not just

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,440
teaching the kids how to make the glove

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,199
imogen explains in the first episode

00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,440
what open source is

00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,480
so we then have nine further episodes

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,600
coming out weekly

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,199
and each one explains an aspect of open

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,480
source to the kids and helps their

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,720
learning and development

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,160
as well as giving them a fun activity

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,240
now that's currently being run

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,680
in a closed environment for only the

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,000
kids in the competition

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,120
but we plan over the summer vacation to

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,920
bring that

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,639
to a much broader group of kids it's

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,959
being released

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,959
creative commons cc by sa which will

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,600
allow other organizations

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,560
to talk to us have the script uh

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,000
translate it

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,160
and have the course run in other

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,079
languages too so i hope we'll get the

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,079
chance to work with maybe nina and

00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,000
people in germany and other countries on

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,760
doing some translations and sharing for

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,440
our kids

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,320
so the final thing i want to mention to

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,480
you about open uk is the ditto project

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,959
and it's the first truly open for good

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,519
project that i've mentioned today

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:02,480
um ditto stands for develop in the open

00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:06,000
and the project is funded by innovate uk

00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:08,959
now this project has 600 000

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,240
pounds of funding a small part of that's

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,079
going to open uk

00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,519
so that we can contribute around

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,639
governance

00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:19,760
legal and policy and we are working to

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:22,720
to make the project open chain compliant

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,519
the project is producing an e-op system

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,760
an e-observation system for hospitals

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,079
and once that's created it's something

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,839
that will be able to scale at a low cost

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:33,440
and be very interoperable

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,600
across different health authorities in

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,800
the uk and internationally

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,519
so well worth taking a look at

00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,120
so how did a nice girl like me end up in

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,320
a space like this

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,880
well uh early in 2012

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,759
i had been a corporate commercial and

00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,800
tech lawyer

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,120
working in a number of big companies

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,079
managing legal teams developing legal

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,000
teams

00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,000
and i was asked if i would go to a

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,320
company called canonical

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,839
in this slightly odd open source field

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,800
that i'd heard of but didn't know much

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,639
about

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,000
um for three months and if i would go

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,600
and help them scope what

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,199
they would do with their legal team and

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,199
then i was going to move to amazon to

00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:16,480
work on an electrical retail project

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,560
that i assume would have been the kindle

00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,560
uh something very unexpected happened to

00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:24,079
me at canonical which was that

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,519
i went in there to help them to build

00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,800
something to be a lawyer

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:31,839
to create a legal environment and i find

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:34,399
very quickly that i found a real home

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,959
somewhere that i felt i belonged and i

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,199
really

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,880
probably uh you could say i went native

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,639
and i discovered that i belonged in this

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,759
open source community

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,000
now for anyone who doesn't know

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,279
canonical it's one of if not the biggest

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,720
open source company in europe

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,199
headquartered in london

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,160
founded by mark shuttleworth and it is

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,240
the commercial

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,839
sponsor of the open source operating

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,160
system ubuntu

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,320
and when i started there ubuntu was the

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,240
desktop of choice and it was very much

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,639
at the forefront of the open desk shop

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,240
for the development community in the

00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,120
time that i was there i was there five

00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,839
years

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,720
what we found was that it spread much

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,120
much broader

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,480
and it became one of the underpinning

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,919
technologies for client

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,559
platform i'm quoting simon wardley here

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,319
but who was the director of cloud at the

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,959
time at canonical and i think we were

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:26,000
something like 78 or 76

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,280
he says of the cloud marketplace um back

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,960
in 2012.

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,320
now that hasn't necessarily changed a

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,320
lot and what we see

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,520
is that open source software like uh

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:36,160
ubuntu sits

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,360
under almost all platform technology and

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,360
i'll come back to that later in the

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,760
presentation

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,880
as i said i have a number of roles so as

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,000
well as being ceo

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:49,360
open uk i'm a european representative

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,200
of oin the open invention network um

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,640
my involvement with oin goes back to my

00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,640
days at canonical

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,679
we made a conscious decision when i ran

00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,000
the legal team

00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,120
not to patent any of our technology or

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,200
innovation

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,200
and instead what we did was contribute

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,720
financially to the infrastructure that

00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,160
builds oin

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:10,960
um oin is the world's biggest defensive

00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,640
intellectual property organization uh

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,400
it's probably not strictly open for good

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,160
but it does a lot of good

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,480
and it is a collaboration across

00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:20,960
organizations

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,039
where every company person or

00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,600
organization who participates

00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:27,520
signs up to an agreement that agreement

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,000
says that if they hold patents

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,679
they will license those patents for free

00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,600
to everybody else in the group

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,679
to the extent those patents read on a

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,440
definition that definition is called the

00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,120
linux system definition

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,520
and it's a list of packages and you'll

00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,480
find it on openinventionnetwork.com

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,600
website so everybody agrees the same

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,520
contract

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,600
nobody pays to join it's free for

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,240
everyone nobody's restricted from

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,880
joining

00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,720
anybody can join go to oim's website and

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,640
you can participate

00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,400
and everybody signs the same deal

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,480
offering their patents up and this

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,240
license to everybody else and receiving

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,280
the same back

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:08,000
the the companies involved are

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,120
wide-ranging lots of automotive mobile

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,360
companies

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,760
tech companies but much much broader

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,679
these days fashion houses

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,880
recruitment consultants all sorts of

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:22,799
companies who use or develop technology

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,559
that's open and we at canonical actually

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,880
became one of the funders who

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,320
paid for the infrastructure along with

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,679
the initial founders

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:36,400
sony nec phillips ibm red hat

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:39,440
and navel suse we have a couple of new

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,280
funders google and nissan and also as

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,360
well as canonical tom tom was an

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,280
associate member so back in the day at

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,760
canonical i sat on the board but when i

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,440
left i made a conscious decision that i

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,960
wanted to keep that involvement

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,440
that the work oin does is really

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,880
important to me and to our community

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,360
anybody who either creates distributes

00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,760
or

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,600
uses open source software ought to be a

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,280
licensee of oin

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,280
the only reason not to be frankly is

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,720
that you want to be a patent aggressor

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,840
and if you've seen the recent gnome

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:12,640
litigation which

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,320
oin supported the gnome foundation when

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,039
they were attacked by

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,960
the rothschild patent non-practicing

00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,799
entity or troll

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,960
you'll see what happens when the open

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,679
source community is really taking on

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:27,600
on the patent front and of course uh the

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,640
the victory that gnome foundation had

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,559
was amazing

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,760
and they not only got a patent license

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,919
for themselves but for

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,360
the whole open source community covering

00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,679
all the patents held by the the

00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,840
rothschild non-practicing entity

00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,960
so one of the the things that i work on

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,799
is oin

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,080
i also have a couple of other formal

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,960
roles i sit

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:49,039
on the open projects advisory council at

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,640
the oasis

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,200
standards body and i guess possibly the

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,360
meat

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,200
the essence of this talk today i'm the

00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,799
chair of the

00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:03,039
um's innovation labs open source

00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,919
and intellectual property advisory i'll

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,120
talk a little bit

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:09,039
more in some detail about that

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,880
just a couple of final things about

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:13,440
projects i'm involved with

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,080
i'm the editor of a book second edition

00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,679
of a book

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,080
and it's called free and open source

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:22,159
software law policy and practice

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:24,799
um that book is pretty much

00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,440
involving or involves almost everybody

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:28,080
who

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,320
works at a a well-known level in

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,720
governance legal compliance

00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,159
policy communities or a lot of those

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,720
folk in any event

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,200
to create 23 chapters guiding you

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,600
through

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,000
how to manage open projects and issues

00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,600
around open

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,400
i'm really proud of the fact that the

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,919
veach foundation have given us funding

00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,000
which means that the book will be open

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,919
access now originally it was going to be

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,440
published this year and we've pushed it

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,679
back because of the pandemic

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,280
it will be published in january i hope

00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,440
i'll get to actually meet many of you

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,280
face to face at fosdem next year

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,440
and we'll be launching the book formally

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,360
at fosdem fingers crossed that will take

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,280
place and we'll all be in brussels

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,799
and then i guess finally my final sort

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,400
of open role is

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,080
things like this i spend a lot of my

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,120
time talking to people in the open

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,440
communities

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,240
and writing about open source um i have

00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,000
a piece coming out in bcs today

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,520
which talks about the track and trace

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,039
apps any of you who've seen anything

00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,200
i've done recently will know that i've

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,360
been following the track and trace apps

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,200
pushing for them to be open-sourced and

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,200
making sure that there's a

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,320
a way for us to find out how they've

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,760
been open-sourced

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:38,240
uh licensing etc across europe and

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,240
beyond

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,720
so uh until the un's technology and

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,760
innovation labs

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:55,230
um dad nina can one of you hit the

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:56,960
presentation please the link

00:22:55,230 --> 00:23:00,080
[Music]

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,360
the fourth industrial revolution has

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,880
changed virtually

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:08,159
every industry in the last decade

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:11,280
and now it's time to apply that change

00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,880
to deliver on un mandates moving

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,440
humanity forward

00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,120
faster by focusing on the use of

00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,880
innovative technology

00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:24,159
is critical to reach the un goals

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,840
the goal of until is to function as a

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,320
startup environment

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,600
and create a platform for collaborative

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,960
problem solving

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:36,080
between un resources academia

00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,320
the private sector and civil society

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,360
each lab will link this platform with

00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,840
innovators

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,760
from across the globe and facilitate the

00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,000
global exchanges of ideas

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,159
and resources to solve some of the

00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,640
humanities most pressing needs

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,840
the until labs will use cutting-edge

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,159
technology

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,360
such as blockchain artificial

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,360
intelligence

00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:02,640
internet of things fintech and drones

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:05,440
with locations in europe africa asia and

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:08,400
more planned in other parts of the world

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,440
each lab will focus on specific

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:12,880
theomatic

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,000
areas in finland for example the first

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,279
state of the art

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,320
until lab focuses on peace and security

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:23,520
education health and circular

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,120
economy it's situated at the center of a

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:28,000
vibrant startup hub

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,039
within the alter university campus in

00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,039
esports

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,880
the global answer network is planning

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,360
multiple collaborative projects

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,799
to help the member states in progressing

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,200
the u.n mandate

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,720
in the areas of peace and security

00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,760
international law

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:47,279
humanitarian affairs human rights

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,880
and sustainable development all labs

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,320
will support one another

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,200
sharing their information and

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:54,240
experiments and communicating successes

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,520
and learnings

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,720
the labs will enhance they will incubate

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,279
and they will accelerate

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,240
technology-based products and services

00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,120
that would address problems and find

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,400
optimal

00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:09,600
solutions we are convinced that this new

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,640
global initiative

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,960
will help us lift multitudes of people

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,159
out of poverty achieve the sustainable

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,559
development goals

00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,440
and enable developing countries to

00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:29,840
advance

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:29,840
into a better future

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:34,159
so thank you the way the social develop

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,000
the the

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,440
labs work is through the sustainable

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,440
development goals

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,360
and those meet the needs of society

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,840
without compromising the future they

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,360
meet today's needs without compromising

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:47,679
our future

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,640
to meet sustainable development we need

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,919
today

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,919
not to compromise tomorrow it's critical

00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,559
to allow sustainable development to come

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,000
from organized practices

00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,240
and that these are based on a shared

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,840
blueprint for peace and prosperity

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:06,720
for people on the planet the 17 goals

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,840
are called fraction from all countries

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,159
they recognize ending poverty and

00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,080
deprivation

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,480
that these must go hand in hand with

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,400
improving health and education

00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,000
that we need to spur economies and

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,679
reduce climate change

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,200
probably never been more important than

00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,360
it is at this time

00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:26,559
as we come out of lockdown and deal with

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,559
the the outputs of the pandemic

00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:31,840
and the aim of these goals the economic

00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:35,200
goals is to meet the un's 2030 agenda

00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:37,840
and to make it a reality and that agenda

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,039
is pretty much a summary of the un's

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,400
goals for the people

00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:43,360
for planet and prosperity and they aim

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,919
to do it through

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,679
ownership from all stakeholders to make

00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,760
it a reality

00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,240
now the sustainable development goals

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,919
also work with nine digital principles

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,159
if you look on my slide down to the

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:58,640
right in the middle you'll see

00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,960
that uh there's a definition there for

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,320
or a principle there which is to use

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,960
open standards open data

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,640
open source and open innovation that

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,760
open source can probably mean software

00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,919
or hardware

00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,919
and frankly it's another definition of

00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,279
this open technology phrase that i

00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,799
started off with

00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,720
showing you that it's been used other

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,880
places

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,080
now these were developed these nine

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,080
principles to address

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,320
failures and development of technology

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,360
in international organizations

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,679
and to allow sharing best practices in

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,960
the use of ict tools in international

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,600
development

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,640
they unify the unified principles were

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,320
pulled together

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,320
over time across a number of

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,360
organizations in the unified work that

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,679
was done

00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,640
by unicef the world health or health

00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:46,159
organization

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,279
the world bank and the um melinda gates

00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,360
foundation

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,960
so absolutely critical to the work that

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,360
until does

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,360
and until's philosophy is that when

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,279
technology succeeds in solving a problem

00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,360
in our likes it becomes invisible

00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,880
the ticking of a clock so constant has

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,720
to fade into the background

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,520
but too often we begin to take this

00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,520
transformative force for granted

00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,039
the technology is not by its nature an

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,120
inclusive phenomenon

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:13,039
its availability in every context cannot

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,760
be assumed and as the clock ticks on

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,919
unnoticed

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,679
lives are lost i don't think there's

00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,440
much that can sum up the importance of

00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,960
technology being inter

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:24,159
open open to us all more than that

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,919
and you'll see there are already four

00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:27,360
labs across the globe and another half

00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,440
dozen are more planned in different

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,760
countries

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,039
so i was approached just over a year ago

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,919
to create the

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:38,159
os and ip advisory group and to give you

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,240
some context we work on a wide array of

00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,480
projects from the four labs

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,880
those have included to date a blockchain

00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,600
land registry for afghanistan

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,640
a platform that measures charities

00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,799
impacts

00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,760
gamification of literacy in the 21st

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,080
century

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,840
and maternal health for parents pretty

00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,559
wide ranging and there's a whole

00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,320
raft more projects that we've worked on

00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:02,159
so the group that we pulled together

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,559
are primarily in europe although we do

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,720
have members in asia and the us

00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:08,960
and the group is mandated to maintain a

00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,720
framework that enables until to foster

00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,720
shareable or open technologies

00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,880
and catalyze the creation of digital

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,880
solutions to build interoperable

00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,559
solutions that can scale across member

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,320
states

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,399
it's really important to me that as many

00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,520
of the projects as possible are open

00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:27,200
and by default they will be

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,440
i would say this is a bit of a motley

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,120
crew this is not my wording this is

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,960
i should probably realize the un's

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,640
wording and we are a group according to

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,039
them with renowned experts in the legal

00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,720
and technology innovation fields

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,159
uh i'm not going to read it all out to

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,399
you but this group of people

00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,919
um actually a few of them are based in

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,520
germany and definitely known to you so

00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,120
you probably all know merco

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:49,279
you'll know isabelle dress from from

00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:52,320
apache and frank kolishek

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:54,399
founder of nexcloud so it's not just

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,760
lawyers it's not just policy people

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:58,399
you know we have community people we

00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,480
have people running open

00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:02,320
companies or companies that use open

00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,880
economists

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,600
policy people all sorts involved in this

00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,679
group

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,000
and that the purpose is very much for us

00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,799
to get a broad community

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,919
and a broad understanding from that

00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,640
grassroots base

00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,399
into the projects but it's not just this

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,919
small group that can work on the

00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:23,440
until projects we have the ability to

00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,799
contribute as individual members of

00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,399
communities by

00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,919
contributing to the projects being run

00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,600
out of the labs

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,159
and you can see more details of those

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,320
individual projects on the website

00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,679
the un is also in process of building a

00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,440
fellowship program

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:39,360
that will allow internships for

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,480
individuals with sponsorship from

00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,480
companies

00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,840
so that they can join a pro bono basis

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,399
to work in the labs

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,000
and something i would recommend strongly

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:50,240
so why does this matter

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,279
i care about open source not just being

00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,200
good software

00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:55,039
i care about open projects not just

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,200
being good projects but being used for

00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:00,240
good but why would anybody else care

00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,919
well he cares i care um but you could

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,640
say of course those two would care they

00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,880
work and open that's all they do

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,320
let's think about it practically so from

00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:11,120
a coding perspective

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,919
it's really important that when projects

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,760
are being built

00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,600
on these in these international

00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,080
organizations on the basis that they've

00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:20,960
got to be scalable across countries

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,080
that they're going to allow access to

00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,840
the code

00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,960
and that we can see that that code is

00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:30,159
secure before it's rolled out and scaled

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,399
it's critical both to keep the member

00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,960
states and the governmental and

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,960
supranational organizations honest but

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,320
also for us to be able to contribute fix

00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,679
bugs

00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,360
it's easier to meet compliance

00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,200
requirements the code will be

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,799
interoperable it can be visible we can

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:49,200
work with it across different projects

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,640
it also allows as codes rolled out

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,840
country per country particularly in

00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,840
developing countries

00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,200
for them to engage and i'll talk more

00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,480
about that later because it is a very

00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,320
important thing

00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,000
but as it becomes scalable within

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,000
country they're able to

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,240
learn how to code learn how to

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,240
contribute and learn how to be part of a

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,799
project themselves

00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,880
so that collaboration in country means

00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,200
that it's not just a fix for the problem

00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,679
or

00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,159
a scratch for a niche as linus would say

00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,120
that actually encourages ownership of a

00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,440
project

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,960
at the local level you may be familiar

00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,399
with the phrase give a man a fish and

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,640
you've given them a meal give

00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:26,240
a teach a man to fish and you'll feed

00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,840
them for life and that's pretty much

00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,840
what these projects allow us to do

00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:35,519
um we should all use open technology

00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:39,039
wherever we can

00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,960
and that is something that even

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:43,120
a company like microsoft today would

00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,799
agree with so we've not just seen these

00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,720
international organizations

00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:48,880
pay lip service and start to move

00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,760
towards it but we've seen at the

00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,880
essence of business major companies some

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,039
of whom

00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,679
really did not like open source to start

00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:59,519
with making that mind shift

00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,039
and i guess we have to wonder why and

00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,480
how that happened and

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,559
if you've seen me speak before you'll

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,320
know i use this slide a lot

00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,919
um so this is a very squishy picture

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,600
it's not not very flattering for my

00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,200
peripheral steve wally but my friend

00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,159
steve wolly was presenting

00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:16,320
at the open source summit at the linux

00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,399
foundation in edinburgh 2018

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,399
in fact he was keynoting it and he was

00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:22,399
keynoting it along with keith bergel of

00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,320
oin the ceo of in

00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:26,080
one after the other because microsoft

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,320
had just signed up to oin

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:30,159
you'll remember i mentioned oin you get

00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,399
access to microsoft's patents to the

00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:35,760
extent they read an open source

00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:38,159
if you uh become part of oin

00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,159
and what steve was explaining was the

00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:43,360
journey that microsoft had been on

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,799
and how a company that 20 years ago 10

00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,200
years ago hated open

00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:49,440
very publicly the company with the ceo

00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,919
who described open source as a cancer

00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,760
can move to the slide that you see now

00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:55,600
in this picture of sasha nadal

00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,840
asking to be judged by microsoft's

00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,159
actions of today

00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:01,840
actions where at least according to

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,679
github microsoft is now the biggest

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,760
single contributor to open source in the

00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:08,639
world

00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,639
where did that come from well steve

00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,320
would tell you it's three things

00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,000
ten years ago clients didn't ask

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,560
microsoft for open source

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,879
today they do clearly money counts

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,800
obviously that makes perfect sense

00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:23,040
i mentioned already the change when i

00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,800
was at canonical where we saw open move

00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,720
from the desktop etc

00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,000
into the the platform and cloud

00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:29,919
environment

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,599
in fact i'm doing a talk in two weeks

00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:34,320
time two weeks today about

00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,359
i think it's called i know what it's

00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,000
called it's my talk

00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,560
it's open under the cloud so that talk

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,560
um

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,599
looks at the different technologies and

00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,280
how the

00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,520
the platform economy would not exist

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,879
without open and microsoft have

00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,599
acknowledged that

00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:51,520
for them to be able to work in platform

00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,599
services they have to be able to

00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,159
understand and use open technology

00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,599
therefore they have to be pro-open and

00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,760
finally the third reason is the

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:02,640
development community

00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,520
particularly those born since 1989 the

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,720
year the the

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,560
linux kernel was created those people

00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:10,880
have grown up with open as a norm

00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,839
and those developers expect nothing but

00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,599
open

00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,599
they they don't see anything strange

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,440
unusual or revolutionary about it they

00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:18,960
just know it's the best way to make code

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,960
so they want to work in that open and

00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,599
collaborative way and if that's good

00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,880
enough

00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:27,599
for a big business like microsoft

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,359
it should be good enough for uh

00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,520
supernational organizations

00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:33,599
charities other ways that we do good

00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,000
using technology today

00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,119
i just wanted to change tax slightly and

00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,160
talk a little bit about another

00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,720
experience i had

00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,200
i i worked for 18 months nearly two

00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,960
years based out of amsterdam

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,320
for a company called veon used to be

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,240
called vimpacong

00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,640
if any of you are based in russia

00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,119
ukraine pakistan algeria bangladesh or

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,280
across

00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:57,920
um the central uh across

00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,240
cis you will know them commonwealth

00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:02,720
across the stands you'll know vimpicon

00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,760
it trades beyond trades under various

00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,160
brands with this

00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,960
be like logos so you'll know beeline if

00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,119
you're in

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,160
russia and you'll know mobylink the

00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:11,200
brand i've used here if you're in

00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,880
pakistan

00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,480
and i was sent out to pakistan for work

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,160
a couple of times which is absolutely

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,800
fascinating

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,520
and this picture was taken in a sook in

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,760
a market

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,960
in a modern building i think it's in g4

00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,720
in islamabad

00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,079
and if you went into the souk you

00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,200
suddenly felt transformed

00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:31,440
back in time you know it was

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,040
fragrant with the smells of spices

00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,160
vibrant with the colors

00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:40,160
of fabrics and ceramics

00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:41,920
in an array of colors really felt uh

00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,079
you know like we were back several

00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,920
hundred years ago until you came to a

00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,960
corner with this little shop

00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:50,720
and this little shop had uh stickers

00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,920
across it from all the major

00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:54,560
mobile networks in pakistan and you'll

00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,160
see here

00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,920
sitting on the counter biometrics

00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,000
machine now these two gentlemen were

00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,960
excessively proud of that biometrics

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,839
machine pakistan has biometrics for all

00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,400
its nationals

00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:08,000
national database and this gentleman

00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,119
polished the machine for several minutes

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,280
before i was allowed to take this

00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,240
picture and in the store there were a

00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,560
few of people

00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,280
each of them holding a wad of cash their

00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:17,680
id

00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,280
and a photocopy of their id and as they

00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,680
came to the counter they would hand over

00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,359
the cash they would use the biometrics

00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,800
to have their fingers printed and for

00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:28,960
them to be checked

00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:31,599
and the prepared pre-prepared

00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:32,000
copy of their id would go into a little

00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,800
book

00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,000
as a receipt it handed the cash and

00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,000
within seconds

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,760
the joys of technology that cash would

00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,440
be transferred

00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,960
somewhere else across the world

00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,240
sometimes to

00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,760
uh in the particular case of the

00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,800
gentleman i was speaking to in the queue

00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,960
in the line

00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,560
um to his father he was a sheep farmer

00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,000
in the mountains of pakistan

00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,760
and his father was going to be able to

00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,599
collect from the local trader there

00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,440
wasn't even a shop in his village the

00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,640
trader would likely be there once a week

00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,960
on a street corner

00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,960
selling whatever vegetable was in season

00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,320
possibly tomatoes that week

00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,000
along with handing out cash or

00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,640
phone credits that have been received

00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:14,240
via these digital transactions

00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:16,160
so you were able to cash out now that

00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,000
is probably a bit interesting but what's

00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:20,160
really interesting about it is that

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,200
in this pakistan and many of these other

00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,200
countries

00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,280
there was a huge population without

00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,040
access to financial services without

00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,920
access to a bank account

00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,839
no bank cards no ability to borrow money

00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,640
and these digital infrastructures being

00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:34,560
built through

00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,240
mobile phone networks were allowing

00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,880
access to

00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,839
financial inclusion from many many poor

00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,040
rich people

00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:44,560
i think the start um 2020s it may have

00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,520
changed because of the pandemic but i

00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,640
think the star

00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:48,960
at the start of the pandemic stat was

00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,800
1.9

00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,240
billion people across the globe still

00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,440
living in poverty

00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:58,880
and a need for them to receive

00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:01,040
financial uh services

00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,960
however that was going to be but with

00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,400
the ability to skip ahead of those of us

00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,760
in the west with our

00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:08,960
bank structures and that was great and i

00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,160
was really proud of the work we were

00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,359
doing now because i felt we were doing

00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:13,520
something useful

00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:15,119
but there was one problem with it it

00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,119
wasn't open source

00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,960
and what i discovered in the last five

00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:22,079
years is that banking has moved

00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,920
to open source projects um or

00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,599
organizations like the women linda gates

00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,079
foundation and the world council of

00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,560
credit unions have led the way in that

00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,720
the gates foundation have recently spun

00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,280
off uh the mojolip foundation i'd

00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,440
recommend

00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,480
anybody interested in fintech take a

00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,599
look at this

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,960
it's an open source payment platform

00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:42,720
which has actually been rolled out

00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:46,160
already in

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:47,920
uh ivory coast and tanzania

00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:49,440
doing exactly what the the structures

00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,119
that we were talking about i was talking

00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,960
about before pakistan was doing you can

00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:54,400
see some more information about it there

00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,200
and i would recommend you take a look at

00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,599
that site

00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,760
but what's happened here is that to

00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:01,280
create this financial inclusion

00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,599
there have been five pillars of

00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,880
financial change where open has been

00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,040
used for good

00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,119
and those are around the fact that it

00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,200
needs to be accessible by all which open

00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,280
is it needs to meet or exceed the

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,880
convenience of cost and utility of cash

00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,400
which of course digital financial

00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,359
services can do

00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,640
it needs to be open to drive competition

00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:22,400
and open innovation

00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:24,560
expands the services offered on a

00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,599
sustainable model and it's very very

00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:29,280
scalable across

00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:31,520
developing countries now

00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,359
just before i wrap up i'm conscious that

00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,040
i've taken up a lot of your time today

00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,800
and you may have some questions i want

00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,480
to chat

00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,240
i want to talk about one last open for

00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,839
good initiative that i'm involved with

00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:45,760
and this is very recent um

00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:48,079
i have a certain opinion of the open

00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,720
source community so it was no surprise

00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:51,599
to me

00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,880
when we went into lockdown that talking

00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,200
to others in our community

00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,880
i was constantly being told about great

00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,680
new projects that people were spinning

00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,400
up

00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,960
projects that would create open

00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,400
ventilators respirators

00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,720
try to help people with financial

00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,000
problems create educational platforms

00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,319
etc

00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,079
but what i find very quickly that as we

00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:13,680
were talking about projects

00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,920
i was seeing duplication of these

00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,599
projects across different countries

00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,520
and i was on a call talking about all

00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,400
suppose of all things with a chat called

00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,599
jacob green

00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,640
at mosslabs.io and we were talking about

00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,760
i suppose but

00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:30,640
most labs had come out of the

00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,760
john hopkins university which of course

00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,760
many of you will know

00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,680
is the the home of the coronavirus

00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,040
dashboard the dashboard that's become

00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,640
the

00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,160
the base point for all of our

00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,200
understanding of

00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,440
um tracking the pandemic

00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,400
so obviously jacob and i both had a

00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,839
strong interest

00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,000
in what was happening across the open

00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:51,680
communities and we realized that there

00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,640
was this duplication we were seeing at

00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,000
different places

00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,400
and we knew that there was a need to

00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,839
pull people together and create a space

00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,680
where we could find out about each

00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:02,640
other's projects

00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,839
so what we did was uh jacob initially

00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:07,520
created

00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:09,839
a slack workspace which then had a riot

00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,359
layer built onto it so that we've got an

00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:14,400
open source

00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,960
uh offering as well and that was just a

00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,720
place

00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,240
for people to come into different

00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,680
channels and talk about the work they

00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:22,640
were doing on specific

00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:24,000
areas or projects to make other projects

00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,800
aware of their projects

00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,119
to let people know if they needed help

00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,480
i'll give you a couple of examples

00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:34,319
so we shared across a number of projects

00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,400
working on open ventilators

00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:37,760
this article that was published in the

00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,520
journal of open law technology and

00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,760
society jobs

00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,440
called breathing breathe out and this

00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:46,480
article helps to explain

00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:49,359
how to use an open hardware license on a

00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:52,319
ventilator an open ventilator

00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:53,760
we shared a nasa project from the jet

00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:57,680
propulsion lab there

00:42:53,760 --> 00:43:00,240
which was for 3d printed respirator

00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,000
and which was also uh available on an

00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,000
open license

00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,200
and we're taking that now as of today

00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,040
one step further

00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:09,119
so i'm sort of giving you a preview of a

00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:12,119
press release that will go out tomorrow

00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,680
by tomorrow morning if you look up open

00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:16,240
opentechresponse.com

00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,520
you will find that as well as our github

00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:20,720
area we also

00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,160
have a website very small website really

00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,839
a landing page

00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,800
that landing page will give you a few

00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:29,760
things you'll be able to pick up

00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,920
this lovely i support open tech response

00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,640
as a widget with the website embedded in

00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,000
it

00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:38,319
you'll be able to volunteer

00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,040
either as a project or as an individual

00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:43,920
looking for a project to work with

00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:45,920
in response to covert 19 so it will be a

00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:48,319
matchmaking service that will allow us

00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,079
to put volunteers and projects together

00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:51,680
and that's been spun out by the open

00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:54,480
teams project i'm really grateful to

00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,079
them for picking it up when we started

00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,680
to work out the kind of tools that would

00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,839
help the communities work together to

00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,119
remove silos and improve collaboration

00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:04,480
globally

00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:05,280
um patrick mcfadden of data stacks was

00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,800
one of the people

00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,319
getting involved in building this out

00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,160
and he pointed out that we should think

00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,079
beyond covert 19.

00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,920
um i don't like being the voice of doom

00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:15,520
and gloom and didn't want to be the

00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,400
person saying and when we have our next

00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,240
disaster

00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,160
but when we have our next disaster we're

00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,960
ready for it we have these tools in

00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,200
place

00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,079
to help the open tech community spin out

00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,079
their solutions

00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,520
fast and to collaborate and be aware of

00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:29,920
what each other's doing

00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,440
and also to matchmake so if any of you

00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,680
are interested whether it's as a

00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,760
developer somebody does documentation

00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:38,160
governance whatever your bag is

00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,560
if you're interested in volunteering go

00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,880
to opentechresponse.com tomorrow morning

00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,560

follow the links through to register as

00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,000
a volunteer

00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:51,440
or to register your project that needs

00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,599
volunteering if you need help

00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,520
and with that i sort of get to the end

00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,480
of my presentation roughly on time i

00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:00,000
think

00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:02,720
um i'm gonna leave at night deb

00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,119
to bring me back to whether or not we

00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:06,880
have

00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:06,880
any questions from the audience

00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,040
great thank you amanda for sharing some

00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,599
of the amazing work that you have been

00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,079
doing

00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:16,800
and the many interesting initiatives

00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:19,680
around open source

00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:22,000
so uh for everyone please ask your

00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:24,319
questions in the slack channel studio

00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,920
uh we still have like five minutes for a

00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:28,240
few questions

00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,000
there is uh so to start there is a

00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:32,160
question from isabel who

00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,839
uh clearly we are impressed by what

00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,560
you're doing with open uk so the

00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,400
question is

00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,000
like is are there any plans to extend

00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,560
the initiative to

00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,440
other countries to germany the eu for

00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:45,680
instance

00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:47,839
it's interesting um he's very flattering

00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:49,440
and i would be very happy to work with

00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:50,800
anybody we've been approached by a

00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,520
couple of countries

00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:56,640
and we've been having a conversation

00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:59,359
with jacob's greens ospo project

00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:01,280
on the basis that it would make sense

00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:02,720
because open uk seems to have come

00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,319
together well

00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:06,720
to take some of the things that we've

00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:08,960
done and replicate them and share

00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,079
so we will look at building a country

00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,160
specific ospo

00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,079
making us a sort of open source program

00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:16,319
office for countries

00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,760
and offering that model to anybody who

00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,440
wants it i wouldn't presume that

00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,599
everybody should use what we've done it

00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,839
just seems to have worked quite well

00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:25,200
um and we're happy to share everything

00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:28,319
that we're doing is available

00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:30,000
on an open license and you know

00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:31,359
take it run with it if you want to do

00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,319
some of the stuff that's there

00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:35,760
it sort of makes me smile because the

00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:37,280
first time i was asked to be involved in

00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,880
open uk i said no

00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,960
i wasn't interested in a country

00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:44,079
specific organization

00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:45,760
and i was persuaded otherwise largely

00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,599
because of brexit so it's a little bit

00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,119
ironic that i wanted to make sure we

00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:50,720
didn't get cut adrift

00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,400
and to make sure that our community knew

00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,680
each other so we could keep engaging

00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,960
internationally

00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:56,560
that now we've got other countries

00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:57,680
talking to us about whether we can help

00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:00,640
them

00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,520
um i'd be really keen if anybody in any

00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:05,040
country

00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:07,839
um is interested in the kids competition

00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:09,440
i'd rather the kids course rather i'd

00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:11,440
really be keen to talk to you

00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,119
because we have the script all we need

00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,200
to do is create a translation

00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:17,599
and have a voiceover done and you have

00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,359
this brilliant 10 episode series

00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,200
it was developed by a guy called david

00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:23,440
well who is an award-winning tech

00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,040
educationalist

00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,119
and we have a company called uh

00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:29,680
dronalism who

00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:31,359
created our branding for open uk they've

00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,440
done all the animation and it's really

00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:36,720
fun

00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:38,800
great thanks uh i hope that answers your

00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,480
question isabel like i guess you anyway

00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,240
noise where she will reach out to you

00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,000
but thanks i think it's

00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,599
quite interesting how we can extend it

00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,440
to other countries and

00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:51,520
um so i don't see any other questions

00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,960
maybe just a question from

00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:57,520
okay so we have another question uh from

00:47:54,960 --> 00:48:00,079
getting would like to know do you know

00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:01,760
of initiatives in the uk public sector

00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:06,079
to promote open source

00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:08,880
so this is uk yeah yeah so i know

00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,280
it depends on what you you want from me

00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,119
uh

00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,400
what my answer should be so i may be

00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:14,000
giving you the wrong answer here i

00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,760
mentioned the ditto project develop in

00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,520
the open which is a iuk

00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:22,480
funded project for the nhs um there is

00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,800
a report coming out probably next week

00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:25,920
from

00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,559
osor the observatory in europe it's

00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,520
currently

00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:31,440
with open uk's legal and policy group

00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:33,359
and we're doing some updating for them

00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,440
and collaborating with them on that

00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:36,559
i think it has about 10 initiatives

00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:39,680
listed

00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:41,520
and we will add a couple more to that

00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:44,400
i don't know whether you're aware of the

00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:46,480
work nhsx is doing but nhsx

00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,800
their policy is to release on an open

00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,920
basis i guess there's some restrictions

00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,920
around that

00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:54,960
and they released at least the front end

00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:57,359
of our track and trace app on that basis

00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,520
but we do intend to be doing a lot more

00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,839
work with the public sector to try to

00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,680
see

00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:03,200
more engagement and to ensure that more

00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:06,200
projects are public

00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:08,000
uh you can contact us at hello at

00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:10,400

on any of that we're really open to

everybody i should have said that

00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:17,520
there is a way of paying to engage with

00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,200
open uk

00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,640
but that's not our goal our goal is for

00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:23,040
it to be open to everybody and

00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,319
anybody can participate you don't

00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:26,720
