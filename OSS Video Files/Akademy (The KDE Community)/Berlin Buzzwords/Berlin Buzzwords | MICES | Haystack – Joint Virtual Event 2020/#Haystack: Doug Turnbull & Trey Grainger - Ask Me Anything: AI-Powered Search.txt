	00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:14,440
hello good afternoon good morning good

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,230
evening wherever you are we are now

00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:20,619
about to have a fantastic session and

00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:22,090
ask me anything on a I powered search my

00:00:20,619 --> 00:00:23,830
name is Charlie hull from open source

00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,949
connections and I'm also one the

00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:28,960
organizers of the haystack conference

00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:32,590
we're going to firstly I'm going to

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:36,520
introduce our two speakers tonight's we

00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:39,070
have firstly Doug Turnbull who is the

00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,800
CTO of open source connections you may

00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:43,840
know him from being the author of the

00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:48,750
relevant search it was a wonderful book

00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,920
I even have it on my desk here and Doug

00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:54,910
pushes the boundary on what's possible

00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:57,370
with search irrelevance and works with

00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:59,649
many clients to really figure out how to

00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:01,149
help them best to achieve fantastic

00:00:59,649 --> 00:01:03,640
serger and I know Doug's been looking

00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:05,140
into the future of search and is

00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,750
contributing to a new book that's coming

00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:11,670
out soon from Manning called a I powered

00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:16,930
search and we also have trade Ranger

00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:19,030
Trey is used to be up until I think

00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:22,390
literally last week the chief algorithms

00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:24,400
officer at lucid works trey is a long

00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:26,860
and distinguished history in search and

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,870
relevance and Trey's leading the charge

00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:31,960
on the AI powered search book I

00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:33,280
mentioned earlier and Trey Trey just

00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,080
before we get into this you've got some

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,440
news on your your new direction don't

00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:41,710
you yeah hey Charlie you as you

00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:43,780
mentioned been Lucy worked for a little

00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:46,270
over four years and actually just left

00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:50,200
to start a new company called search

00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:52,750
colonel that is a search relevance a

00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,880
high-power search sort of consultancy

00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,830
and software development company got

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,500
some exciting news coming up in the

00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:02,020
coming weeks or about that as well but

00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,430
but yeah it's gonna be a fun new

00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:12,040
adventure for me so looking forward to

00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:13,450
it okay so yeah I just wanted to I am

00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:16,900
afraid of having some trouble accessing

00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:18,340
the slack at the moment so don't do it

00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,910
do you want to give me a quick

00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:25,970
introduction perhaps as to

00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:29,090
well where you think the next the next

00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:33,400
big thing is with search where I mean it

00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:37,070
vectors what what's the next thing oh

00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:39,560
yeah we had a lengthy conversation about

00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:41,840
this open source connections retreat

00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,010
about where we think the future is going

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,580
and I think it's an interesting

00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:48,010
conversation and I think you could talk

00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:52,970
about it in a couple of different ways

00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:57,980
one is the evolution of search itself

00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:59,750
and ranking so machine learning coming

00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,720
more to the front as opposed to being

00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:04,490
this sort of thing off in the distance

00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,630
that is often aspirational for a lot of

00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:11,690
teams and along with that I think comes

00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:13,430
a lot of sort of vector-based approaches

00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:15,410
to search the inspector specifically the

00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:21,160
voice search engine has always been

00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:24,709
sparse vector based indexes and how the

00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:26,390
two systems interplay in a single system

00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:30,820
I think is an interesting question and

00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:35,000
one that we're solving I think to

00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:39,260
another sort of direction is the extent

00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,360
to which the search UI is changing and

00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:46,340
how people want to interact with search

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,630
results so in I think a lot of you see

00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:51,350
this with Google and I blogged about

00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:53,060
this recently if you search for

00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:56,030
something like the neverending story on

00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,920
Google you'll get a search results page

00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:00,380
with all kinds of different question

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,090
boxes some of them are answering

00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,680
specific questions some of them are

00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:05,480
asking you if you want to watch the

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,010
movie never ending story some of them

00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,140
are giving you an overview of the movie

00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:13,070
and I think it's interesting how the UI

00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:15,590
is evolving to almost solve anticipate

00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:20,419
the many possible intentions of the user

00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:24,440
and provide you many different search

00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:27,200
user interface and ranking experiences

00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,900
based on based on possible information

00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,380
needs you have and then finally I think

00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,860
another thing that we talked about was

00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,229
sort of related

00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:41,360
to the search becoming increasingly

00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:43,219
specialized so you have like things like

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,319
question-answering where transformer

00:04:43,219 --> 00:04:50,060
models have been really transformative

00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:52,099
and you have ecommerce is being

00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,330
increasingly specialized in its own

00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:55,430
right

00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:59,210
you have many subdomains in search

00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:02,330
ranging from conversational based

00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:03,860
approaches to search to things that

00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:06,500
verge on personalization and

00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:08,629
recommendation systems and I think that

00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,090
combined with the UI changes and

00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:13,430
combined with how we're rethinking

00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:16,250
ranking and search engines is really

00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:18,169
gonna make the next five years a really

00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:25,219
sort of revolutionary time in this sort

00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:25,939
of AI powered search world so thanks

00:05:25,219 --> 00:05:29,060
Doug

00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:30,680
Trey how's the book going to cover this

00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,779
and what's your approach with writing a

00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:34,610
book and covering what's what's next in

00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:37,520
the world a third yeah it's a good

00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:42,550
question so you know I like oh you know

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:45,110
everything Doug just said the I've got a

00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:46,759
slightly different take just in the

00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:50,240
sense of how everything fits together

00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:52,430
and I think the book will hopefully lay

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,529
that out nicely but you know

00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:56,539
historically search engines have been

00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:58,789
very much keyword-based like Doug

00:05:56,539 --> 00:06:00,949
mentioned with the inverted index over

00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:02,900
the last handful of years especially the

00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:06,500
last five years there's been just an

00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:09,289
explosion of innovation happening in the

00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:11,479
NLP space specifically with the rise of

00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:14,779
you know language models transformers

00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:17,810
the stuff Doug just mentioned and in a

00:06:14,779 --> 00:06:21,229
lot of ways most people are starting to

00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:22,849
see that as the future of search just in

00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:25,520
the sense that you know hey keyword

00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:27,259
search is dead but you know these these

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,990
new models are better and they're going

00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:32,300
to completely replace keyword search and

00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:35,029
I I think it's a lot more nuanced than

00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:37,789
that I think that essentially if you

00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:39,710
think of the intelligent ways that you

00:06:37,789 --> 00:06:41,349
can sort of piece together a search

00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,639
engine and a high-powered search engine

00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:44,990
you know keyword search is a key piece

00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:47,390
of that and you especially need that in

00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:49,160
the long tail but also

00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,450
you know things like knowledge graphs

00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,460
which have been used for years

00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,810
you know sometimes auto-generated using

00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,180
machine learning sometimes manually

00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:57,710
generated really have a really important

00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:01,370
place I think as well and in that

00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,900
picture and the transformer models and

00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:05,660
and and the density vector search

00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:07,280
capabilities layer on top of that the

00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,440
ability to understand language and

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,240
semantically understand a domain better

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,770
than some of those other approaches and

00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,990
so I really think that it's about

00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:18,410
piecing all those together as well as

00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:21,380
taking both you know traditional content

00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:23,030
understanding the understanding of users

00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:26,090
and their behaviors and their actions in

00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:28,010
terms of signals and also a really rich

00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,500
understanding of the domain of the

00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:33,620
business that your search engine is

00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:35,750
serving going back to the the

00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,420
specialization as Douglas missioning and

00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:40,220
so in the book we sort of have it broken

00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:42,320
up into sections and we're gonna walk

00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,150
through each of those topics and one of

00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,490
my real goals with the book is being

00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:48,230
able to not just talk about these things

00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:50,300
independently but to try to paint a

00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:52,820
picture of how they all can interrelate

00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,650
and be used together to overall build a

00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,840
better systems that'll be the goal we're

00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:59,510
still fairly early in on the book but

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,420
you know and and obviously the space is

00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:05,270
evolving especially in terms of what's

00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:07,880
happening on the the inspector and

00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:09,170
neural search side of things but by the

00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,170
time we get to the end of it I think we

00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:14,600
will have that piece all reasonably

00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,860
figured out and then you know within two

00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,450
months of publishing the book I'm sure

00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:21,140
the book will be outdated but that's not

00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:22,670
a bad thing right thanks Trey I won't

00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:25,220
embarrass you both by asking what the

00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:27,020
book is going to be available I'm sure

00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:29,510
it'll be available when it's ready it

00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:32,360
will available as soon as it's ready yep

00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:34,670
as soon as it's ready fantastic okay so

00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,580
we've actually got a couple of questions

00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:39,350
from the slack I'm just going to hop

00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:43,729
over there we have a question from Tom

00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:46,100
Bergman's thank you Tom who asks can a I

00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:48,830
powered search replace for a part

00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:50,810
traditionally tuned relevance or will it

00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:53,330
only be effective after the traditional

00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:56,030
tuning is maximized and maybe dark you'd

00:08:53,330 --> 00:09:01,000
like to start answering that one yeah

00:08:56,030 --> 00:09:03,890
sure so I actually think they are

00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,720
you know I'm work I'm a queer consultant

00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,760
so we like to think about pyramids and

00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:11,600
maturity models and stuff I actually

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,370
think that one of the a lot of the

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,500
things that go into AI PowerSearch you

00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:19,550
actually build by doing manual relevance

00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:21,680
tuning a lot of the practices involving

00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:23,810
building probably the most the hardest

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,410
problem that you do is how do you

00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:29,360
measure search quality and so when you

00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:30,980
even when you're doing a manual solution

00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:35,210
and you kind of start simple right you

00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:36,980
start with how am I going to like this

00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:38,840
is a practice we go through with clients

00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:42,680
here I've done nothing with their search

00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:44,720
we say okay give me one area of search

00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,480
that you think is terrible let's go and

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,480
gather some queries and just just start

00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:52,760
I mean just start with some a dozen

00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,970
couple dozen queries see what's good see

00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:58,070
what's bad and then develop what we call

00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,870
a judgement list so judgment lists is

00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:03,740
basically you know which results are

00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:05,930
good and bad for for queries and then we

00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,550
tune those up manually I mean that's

00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:09,400
always the starting point we tune this

00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:12,110
up a bit manually we kind of go about

00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:17,690
iterating on that and just seeing how

00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:19,220
things evolve and what you find is if

00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,660
you go through that process enough

00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:23,240
you're gonna start to ask yourself the

00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:27,020
question shouldn't I be using machine

00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,250
learning to optimize this and you're as

00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,660
you're going through this process you're

00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:32,570
gonna ask a lot of questions you're

00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:35,570
gonna ask okay so I started out by just

00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:37,130
gathering maybe what my product person

00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:39,380
or the marketing person thought were

00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:41,060
good search results you really should

00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:42,770
start to question that really early

00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:45,070
probably and to say well maybe we should

00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:47,540
go out and see how users are interacting

00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:49,670
with search results bringing behavioral

00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:51,350
signals they can bring in different

00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:53,390
things like that and start to ask how

00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:54,890
could we use this what other ways could

00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:58,610
be used to measure and sort of make

00:10:54,890 --> 00:11:00,020
those judgments more accurate how can we

00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,970
our crease our maturity in that level

00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:04,100
and then you might continue to tune

00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:06,680
things manually but then you might say

00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:09,590
this is a bit labor-intensive you know

00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:11,600
I'm sitting here and we use Cupid for

00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:14,160
this which many people may know about

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,040
I'm sitting here in Cupid I'm

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,079
I've got 200 queries I'm trying to tune

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:24,180
these I'm trying to improve relevance

00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:27,810
and how can I do this let emission light

00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:29,430
a machine take this over and I think

00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:31,079
there's sort of two paths to go down

00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:33,420
there I think you have you have the

00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:36,720
foundation now now you can go in a

00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:37,949
direction of within the search engine

00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,680
maybe thinking about something like

00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:42,930
Lauren's rank but I also think very

00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,060
important is around the search engine

00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:46,949
things like a lot of the work that you

00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:49,920
may have done manually so basically do

00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:52,410
some rudimentary intent detection or to

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,079
build rudimentary taxonomy and knowledge

00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:57,029
graphs and then you can start looking at

00:11:55,079 --> 00:12:00,389
building that out with some more machine

00:11:57,029 --> 00:12:01,980
learning based approaches so all to say

00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:03,600
I think they go hand-in-hand actually

00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,620
and I think one sort of set you up for

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,370
success for the other fantastic thanks

00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:12,439
Doug

00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:15,750
try to do you have anything to add um

00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:19,649
yeah so I I tend to start with the idea

00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:21,740
so so like Doug was saying you uh what

00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:24,420
often happens is people start they

00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,220
install a search engine you know or

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:28,370
elasticsearch whatever it is they they

00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:30,720
get it in production and realize that

00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:32,279
they've accomplished a major feat but

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,529
the quality of the search results

00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:35,880
doesn't look that good you know they

00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:38,189
start having all these pet queries that

00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,740
just don't work and then essentially

00:12:38,189 --> 00:12:43,410
start one one at a time knocking out

00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:46,680
tasks adding synonyms you know maybe

00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:48,300
doing with stock words overly and doing

00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:49,920
tuning of fields and boosts and all that

00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,949
kind of stuff and then you sort of over

00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,050
the course of several years eventually

00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:56,670
meander two ways of doing all of that

00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:59,579
with machine learning and automating it

00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:01,470
often by that point the size of the

00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:03,329
search team has gotten excessively large

00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:05,399
and a lot of people are doing really

00:13:03,329 --> 00:13:07,949
hard work that is hard to maintain so I

00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:09,959
I actually tend to start with the idea

00:13:07,949 --> 00:13:11,519
that some of these things should be

00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:13,980
automated from the beginning because

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:16,199
there's now well-established patterns

00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,720
for how to automate those things and

00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:21,300
that way you can focus on the adding

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,059
domain expertise obviously not

00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:26,850
everything can be automated but I tend

00:13:24,059 --> 00:13:27,900
to start with you know there's always a

00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,340
build versus by

00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,210
aspect you know there's some commercial

00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,160
software that can do this stuff

00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:34,350
automatically there's you know like our

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,780
book that we're working on shows you how

00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:40,020
to do it there's lots of tools and

00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:42,990
techniques out there but I do think more

00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:45,450
and more so that we're gonna see a world

00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,860
where a lot of the automation of these

00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:49,830
things is actually becoming commoditized

00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:52,050
and much easier to do therefore people

00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,670
don't start manually tuning they start

00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:56,010
with at least some level of automated

00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:58,320
tuning and then they go in and fix

00:13:56,010 --> 00:14:03,690
wherever that you know machine based

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,890
tuning was off the mark great thank you

00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,210
I know that we're quite there yet but I

00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:09,870
think that's the direction we'll be

00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:12,600
heading fantastic ok so we've got

00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:13,800
another question from from the virtual

00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,950
floor

00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:19,770
Torsten has a question

00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:21,690
when onboarding onto a high-powered

00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:24,750
search how can I ensure that I don't

00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:26,340
just optimize my local maximum for

00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:29,100
example when judgments are based on

00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:33,630
recent clicks so trade you want to kick

00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:38,580
us off with that one oh boy it's a it's

00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:39,840
a fun question so going to the example

00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,850
you gave Charlie about the results and

00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,410
clicks so let's say you're doing

00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:46,430
something like learning to rank where

00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:49,800
you are you know taking search results

00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:51,240
learning from a judgments list which

00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,750
results are good for any particular

00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:57,000
query and then trying to optimize the

00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:59,250
the tuning of your boost and whatever

00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,330
fundamental algorithm or classify are

00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:05,700
using to to rank the results if you do

00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:07,080
something naive like you know take all

00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:11,700
of the documents that were clicked on

00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:14,850
and use those as an indication of a good

00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:17,280
result and then start optimizing for

00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:19,520
that essentially be the documents that

00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:22,020
were clicked to become your your

00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:23,820
positive ratings for learning to rank

00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:26,940
you're going to get in a giant mess

00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:28,530
because you do have inherent bias for

00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,940
example people tend to click on things

00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:33,090
in the top of the list even if they're

00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,800
not the best results people and

00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:37,620
documents that we're never seen you know

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,540
we'll never get any boosts and so sort

00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,610
of manually creating those lists what

00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,350
some people do

00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:44,760
I'm going the ops the opposite end of

00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:46,470
the spectrum where you are just taking

00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,070
the results that people actually saw and

00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:51,960
clicked on a is very problematic and so

00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:54,630
that's where things like click models

00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:55,980
come into play where you know instead of

00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:58,230
just looking at what people did click on

00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:00,030
you know there's lots of ways to take

00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:03,090
the the click streams to actually figure

00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:05,640
out of the clicks or even the documents

00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:07,830
that were skipped over you know how can

00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:10,530
you understand what the user was

00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:12,420
actually intending and what they and

00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:15,480
what they meant so like for is one

00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:17,730
example a very common click model is

00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,560
that this notion of using kind of a

00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:21,780
click skip graph so instead of just

00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:23,520
looking at which document somebody

00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:25,500
clicked on you also look at the

00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,700
documents that they skipped over for

00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,080
example if they click on the first

00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,840
document and they went to the you know

00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:32,040
third document you know several things

00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,930
you know they click the first one and

00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,580
they kept looking you know that they saw

00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,780
the second one and skipped over and went

00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,400
to the third one and then you know that

00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:40,230
they click on the third one and so

00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,940
depending upon your domain and the kind

00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:43,380
of search you're doing you might

00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,410
interpret those actions slightly

00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,720
differently but in general you know for

00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:50,400
a common search use case you might infer

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,320
that result number three may have been

00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:54,930
the final answer result number two

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,280
looked bad and result number one you

00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,350
know was interesting enough to click on

00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,510
but not where the user ended up and

00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,470
based upon that you can use a model to

00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:04,260
then train the learning to rank

00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:06,390
algorithm I know you know there's lots

00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:09,480
of other pieces of search in terms of a

00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:11,010
local maximum that you might have to

00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,540
look at because there's there's lots of

00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:14,339
different AI power search techniques to

00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,690
do everything from automatically

00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:18,209
learning synonyms detecting

00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:20,180
domain-specific phrases building a

00:17:18,209 --> 00:17:24,060
ranking classifier for learning to rank

00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:26,670
doing sort of semantic or statistical

00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:28,380
query parsing to determine phrases and

00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,880
to incur expansion through things like

00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:31,980
the semantic knowledge graph but in

00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,960
general if you're talking about click

00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:37,380
signals and how you leverage those it's

00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:39,030
really important to add some nuance in

00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:41,550
terms of your understanding of what

00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:42,870
those signals actually mean relative to

00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:47,640
all of the other behaviors and actions

00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:49,800
and I know Doug has studied a lot and

00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,750
Todd and build a lot with with click

00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,920
models as well I know Doug if you've you

00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:56,100
want to add

00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:58,730
more there yeah click bottles are great

00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:00,780
because they overcome physician bias so

00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:04,530
they're it's really one of their goals

00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:06,780
is if you're if they know that there's a

00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:08,790
sort of modeling of whether or not users

00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:10,530
are examining results and if they're

00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:12,410
examining how what proportion of them

00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:15,450
are potentially clicking them and

00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:17,910
examining is not just was the thing

00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:19,560
rendered on the page is did this seem to

00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:21,840
is this seeming to gather someone's

00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:24,060
attention because many things can be on

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,680
my screen and I have many times missed

00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:30,900
the button someone is yelling at me to

00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:34,230
click right and so that that can help a

00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:37,040
lot I think thinking about Orson's

00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:40,170
question to there's also this other bias

00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,960
which is presentation bias and this is

00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:44,700
where you can get to it like a vicious

00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:46,920
negative feedback loop with sort of

00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,810
machine learning based search where you

00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,760
know basically what you said right

00:18:48,810 --> 00:18:52,290
people click on what they see they

00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,600
continue to interact with those results

00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:57,600
because that's what's who had shown to

00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:59,100
them and our models learn that that's

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,320
those are the best results because those

00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:03,600
are clicked on and this cycle just

00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,060
perpetuates and this great result on the

00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,690
thousandth page is never seen or

00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:12,600
interacted with I think there's a lot of

00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:14,940
really interesting ways to measure and

00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:18,380
get at that and I actually think the

00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:21,600
biggest silver bullet any search team

00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:23,820
has or can conferring to bear is

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,860
measurement and I know what open source

00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,870
connections the most mature search teams

00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:31,500
that we work with they actually spend

00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:33,650
about I would say 50% to 60% of their

00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:37,380
resources actually on measurement and

00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:39,780
maybe the rest on solutioning and it's

00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:42,000
probably because they can have such

00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:45,810
confidence and measurement that they can

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,390
then turn those that fantastic

00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:50,250
foundation of training data into an

00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:54,150
amazing machine learning based solutions

00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:55,800
to search and what they what the best

00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,630
teams I've seen do the most mature teams

00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:00,720
they don't just have one way of

00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:02,300
gathering say we use the term implicit

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,950
judgments that osc2

00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:06,720
distinguish between the explicit

00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:10,320
judgments that you get into

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:14,240
they searched like truck-based relevance

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:18,059
challenges they don't just get like one

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,070
view of a click model and how its how

00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:22,169
certain accuracy of different the

00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:25,559
relevance different search results they

00:20:22,169 --> 00:20:29,159
look at many sources of truth so you

00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:32,400
might have a sense of what's relevant

00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:34,500
for keyword based on another training

00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,280
set or knowledge graph out there you

00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:43,559
might have your a be testing as another

00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:45,120
way of doing that you another you might

00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:47,429
have some people will differentiate

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,950
between you do level of human relevance

00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:51,419
testing or human SERP evaluation where

00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:53,070
they're actually evaluating search

00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:56,220
results page to say is this good or is

00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:58,590
this bad in a lab setting and then

00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:01,830
finally I'm really interested in the

00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:03,390
field of active learning for this so for

00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:06,570
those who don't know active learning is

00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:08,159
basically the modeling basically imagine

00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:09,659
your machine learning algorithms could

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,120
have a research question about their

00:21:09,659 --> 00:21:14,730
training data so I have all of these

00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:17,340
documents and all of these queries and I

00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:19,620
have these you know we have all these

00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:23,130
examples where when someone searches for

00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:26,340
a movie there's a strong title match but

00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:28,679
I have no examples of a weak title match

00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:32,730
but a strong body match in this specific

00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:35,669
context so maybe if I you know insert

00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:38,190
into my search results in the third

00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:40,590
result or something something of that

00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:42,150
nature that would be an area I could get

00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,070
a tremendous amount of gain on in my

00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:45,840
training data with instead of just

00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:47,640
randomly drawing something or throwing

00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,330
it in there or trying to guess at Lasha

00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,070
throw in there

00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:52,289
I should really see where my training

00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:54,539
data is weak and where I can get more

00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:57,480
sort of signal on what's relevant what's

00:21:54,539 --> 00:22:01,049
rel not relevant as another way to serve

00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:02,640
combat that it's sort of basically work

00:22:01,049 --> 00:22:07,830
on the biases in the data itself

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:10,440
directly yeah if if I could piggyback on

00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:12,630
that a little bit the you sort of

00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,360
introduced the notion of diversity in

00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:17,039
search results a little bit I think that

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:19,200
you know I've spent a lot of time

00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,490
working on with various customers and

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,890
problems on the Samana

00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:24,900
take search and really trying to

00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:26,730
interpret the intent of users in terms

00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,190
of the words they're using and the

00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:32,820
context in which they're using them and

00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:34,280
I I get the question oftentimes and this

00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:37,230
refers back to the original question of

00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:39,630
hey so words can have different meanings

00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:41,670
you know like I like to use the word

00:22:39,630 --> 00:22:44,100
driver for example you know depending

00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:46,679
upon the context a driver could be you

00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:49,650
know a person who drives a car an uber

00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:52,890
driver a truck driver it could be a kind

00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:54,240
of golf club it could be you know

00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:55,770
something that you need to install on

00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,140
your computer for your printer to work

00:22:55,770 --> 00:23:00,630
and so if you look at sort of the word

00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:03,720
driver within the context of you know

00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:05,010
C++ or embedded it takes on a very

00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,309
different meaning than if you look at

00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:12,210
the ever in the context of you know golf

00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:15,510
or in the context of you know shipping

00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:17,940
for example and so what's often the case

00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:20,490
is if you go just run a keyword search

00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:23,250
without having this semantic or sort of

00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:24,690
knowledge graph based understanding you

00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:27,570
end up with a set of search results

00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:29,700
where result number one is a VM CDL

00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:31,440
driver for a trucking company and result

00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:34,320
number two is a golf club and result

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,970
number three is an uber driver and the

00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,470
problem is that most people when they

00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:39,030
type in driver they have a specific

00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:40,980
meaning that they're thinking at the

00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:42,840
time when you show results like that

00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:44,280
they think you're an idiot

00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,429
they look at the search results they're

00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:49,559
all over the place and they they think

00:23:47,429 --> 00:23:52,230
your search engine absolutely has no

00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:53,910
clue what it's doing and the reality is

00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:56,760
because you're doing a keyword match

00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:57,900
those results all match the text but

00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,070
it's much more important to match the

00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,860
meaning so the question is how do you

00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:04,290
display that to an end user and and

00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:05,970
oftentimes if you think of you know

00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:07,740
field collapsing or grouping kind of

00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:11,790
capabilities you can actually if you can

00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:14,250
hone in on those disambiguated meanings

00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:16,770
and actually kind of group the results

00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:19,290
based upon those and show the end user

00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:21,390
either one hey we've chosen a specific

00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:23,250
meaning and here's here it is and if you

00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:25,410
want other meanings click here and we'll

00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:27,480
show them to you or even in the search

00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:29,970
results just show you know sort of a

00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,200
couple of buckets or groups with the

00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:33,270
different meanings so the user can

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,230
clearly see what you're doing there and

00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:35,640
then

00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:38,040
realize that there's multiple meanings

00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,870
and they can either filter their search

00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:42,570
results to get get at one or they can

00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:45,900
just click on one of them and dive in I

00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:47,070
think that you know that also gets to

00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:50,610
what you're saying about being able to

00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:52,320
take to be able to take other results

00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:54,900
maybe further down in the list like

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,240
result number 1000 and bring it up so

00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:58,799
that it actually gets some visibility

00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,510
when you've got multiple meanings often

00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,770
one of those meanings will be shoved way

00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:04,919
down the list and so if you can still

00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:06,720
find the best result that takes on that

00:25:04,919 --> 00:25:09,030
interpretation and show it I think

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,390
there's a lot of ways to both teach your

00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:13,770
customers what you have available while

00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:16,110
showing that your engine actually is

00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:18,330
intelligent and understanding them and I

00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:20,850
think that that's another way to kind of

00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:22,910
end up boosting things that otherwise

00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:26,490
might remain hidden

00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:27,990
fantastic Thanks actually how do you

00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:29,970
mention diversity there and I know

00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:32,340
there's a panel later this week

00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:35,010
I think Doug you're part of all on

00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,419
diversity esse olds which we thought was

00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:37,919
such an important subject we should get

00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:40,410
lots of people talking about it so

00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:45,450
looking forward to that so we've we've

00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:48,780
got a another question from Mia when

00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:51,000
when do you feel that neural search I

00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:53,160
power search were whatever we want to

00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,080
call it versus traditional keyword

00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,750
search it's most useful and in which use

00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:00,690
cases in particular do they solve who

00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:02,340
would like to pick up that one right

00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:06,660
thank you go ahead you want to go first

00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:09,900
sir so I kind of mentioned a leader to

00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:11,970
this earlier but if you think root three

00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:15,000
essentially three different major ways

00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:17,250
of interpreting a keyword that was typed

00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,290
in you know one being just traditional

00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:21,240
keyword search let me max match the text

00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:24,780
one being more of a knowledge graph

00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:29,160
based approach where you you take the

00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:32,970
text you have some pre-existing domain

00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:34,679
graph you know an ontology knowledge

00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:36,450
graph where you can go look that thing

00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:38,250
up and understand what it relates to and

00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:40,980
how it relates to your domain and then

00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:45,059
the third being this this neural search

00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:48,050
or you know an embedding language model

00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:56,090
approach you know

00:26:48,050 --> 00:27:00,300
say I have a query like let's say

00:26:56,090 --> 00:27:04,230
fast-food restaurants near Berlin

00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:06,990
buzzwords or near Berlin let's say you

00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:08,520
know traditional keyword search is

00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:10,500
probably not going to do great with that

00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,970
because it's going to try to look up

00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:13,050
each of those individual words it's only

00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:15,630
going to match documents to have the

00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:17,460
word near in them and and it's not it's

00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,720
not really understanding the logical

00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:23,820
connection between the things in the

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:26,220
query a neural search approach is going

00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:27,270
to understand what NIR means is going to

00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:28,770
potentially understand what the

00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:31,410
restaurant is and it's going to

00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:33,750
understand Berlin but it's not

00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:35,760
necessarily you know and it might be

00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,720
able to solve a surface level question

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:39,150
like that but it may not necessarily

00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,710
completely draw that inference if the

00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:44,480
query gets much more complex than that

00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:48,870
where you've got you know something like

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:51,360
you know hamburger restaurants near my

00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:52,800
hotel at Berlin buzzwords there's no way

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,600
that the engine is going to naturally

00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:57,140
understand the relationship between

00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,490
those things from from a language model

00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:01,560
so if you had a knowledge graph that

00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:02,940
could actually pull in those pieces of

00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:05,820
information and actually traverse the

00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:08,730
graph you can draw a lot more relational

00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:09,810
type inferences much simpler than you

00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:11,340
would with a neural model which would

00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:13,260
have to be trained in multiple there's

00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:15,780
deep and really be able to do that and

00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:18,120
so I would say that relational type

00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:20,790
queries really need more of a knowledge

00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:22,590
graph based approach more general

00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:24,090
language queries so question-answer

00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:26,090
systems or something that needs to

00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:28,950
interpret and understand the the

00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:31,080
semantic meaning of language or even

00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:33,690
domain-specific language those are going

00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:36,570
to do better with a neural approach and

00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:38,880
then of course people just type in

00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:40,650
random keywords or even you know lists

00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:44,070
of things that are very specific and

00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:46,400
their keys or IDs or things that are

00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:50,760
really really far down the long tail

00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:52,770
neither or boolean operators or any of

00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,590
that kind of stuff neither the knowledge

00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:57,510
graph based approach nor the neural

00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:59,730
approach are really going to tackle

00:28:57,510 --> 00:29:01,420
those very well and so I tend to think

00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:03,760
that those are three different

00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:05,920
ways of solving problems where you know

00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,810
traditional keyword search is really

00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:10,300
good with the long tail and does okay

00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:12,120
with the rest knowledge graph is really

00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:14,430
good with relational queries and

00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:16,630
understanding domain-specific

00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:17,530
relationships and then the neural

00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:19,750
approach is really good with just

00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:24,520
general language understanding and if

00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:26,140
trained appropriately through transfer

00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,700
learning or what have you also able to

00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,960
dig into the semantics of domain but I

00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:32,170
think you really need to combine them

00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,450
even like Google when they released the

00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:35,950
the the Bert's and they're released bert

00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:37,630
into their search results i think they

00:29:35,950 --> 00:29:39,880
correct me if I'm wrong Doug but I think

00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:41,890
that it's only being used is it 20% of

00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:44,380
queries actually leverage it it's

00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:46,510
whatever query is over certain keywords

00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:49,150
they said they said this is the largest

00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:50,980
impact and they meant you said 10% of

00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:53,920
our crews were impact but it was their

00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:56,410
longest queries and so it was question

00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,460
answering kind of queries yeah I've got

00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:06,180
that news article here than me

00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:08,260
politically doc what do you think that I

00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:12,610
think it's I think it's interesting

00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:15,090
because I have so many there's so many

00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:17,500
dimensions to take this kind of question

00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:20,860
one of the things you notice off the bat

00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:22,570
when you look at any sort of trek

00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,460
competition when it's getting started a

00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:25,510
trek or one of these I our common

00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:28,300
interface information with readable

00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:31,240
competitions it's fascinating to me how

00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:33,310
so many people will just start with try

00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:36,070
be m25 see how it works and it does

00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:39,430
pretty well and it's so interesting to

00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:42,880
me how it's sort of like broadly above

00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:45,580
average but not particularly amazing and

00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,960
not particularly terrible and then

00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:49,510
people try a bunch of things and they'll

00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:54,010
struggle to beat be m25 and then finally

00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:57,190
for a given specific task they'll find

00:30:54,010 --> 00:31:02,500
some model that is very tailored to that

00:30:57,190 --> 00:31:05,050
task and it's very specific to that task

00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,940
but it's not as generalizable or

00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:10,300
something and as being like being pretty

00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:12,250
bad I think that's really interesting so

00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:15,309
people I think transformer models are

00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:17,279
interesting because they seem to have

00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:23,559
a niche in terms of being a bit more

00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:26,769
generalizable but at the same time the

00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:29,490
other thing I noticed is a lot of times

00:31:26,769 --> 00:31:32,320
when you there was a really funny thing

00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:33,879
on and this has been true my whole

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,009
career there's a really funny thing on

00:31:33,879 --> 00:31:38,470
Hacker News which was like this word

00:31:36,009 --> 00:31:41,649
does not exist calm and it was all

00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:46,990
randomly generated the dictionary

00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:48,789
definitions and I remember 15 years ago

00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:50,769
people would generate research papers

00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:52,840
with Markov models it's like you know

00:31:50,769 --> 00:31:54,460
this will generate your term paper for

00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,350
you just type in the subject and we'll

00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:58,330
use a Markov model to generate some

00:31:56,350 --> 00:32:00,070
gibberish and occasionally you would get

00:31:58,330 --> 00:32:03,490
some interesting sounding sentences out

00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:04,539
of it and I'm pretty sure the the

00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:06,549
quality of the model

00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:09,249
I'm sure the quality of the models has

00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:11,860
improved since then but we do a lot of

00:32:09,249 --> 00:32:13,990
cherry-picking of these things so when

00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:16,659
you look at something like this word

00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:18,429
does not exist calm you might see that

00:32:16,659 --> 00:32:22,059
if you I don't know what the I haven't

00:32:18,429 --> 00:32:25,029
done a measurement 30% 50% maybe 70% of

00:32:22,059 --> 00:32:26,559
the terms are interesting but the rest

00:32:25,029 --> 00:32:28,119
of them that are just like oh that was

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:31,299
weird let me just hit refresh so I get

00:32:28,119 --> 00:32:33,730
something else that's interesting it's

00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:37,899
hard to know why and it's hard to debug

00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:40,269
why and I find like when you do search

00:32:37,899 --> 00:32:42,999
relevance work or any kind of even

00:32:40,269 --> 00:32:45,129
machine learning based work you often

00:32:42,999 --> 00:32:48,519
want to know why things aren't working

00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:51,309
and when you have a deeply complex model

00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:53,649
that understanding that like ok we have

00:32:51,309 --> 00:32:55,840
this class you might you know this

00:32:53,649 --> 00:32:57,100
happens every time we work with the

00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,600
client this happens it's like we have

00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:00,009
this class of query that's extremely

00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,139
challenging we don't understand why it's

00:33:00,009 --> 00:33:05,440
not working how do we treat this kind of

00:33:02,139 --> 00:33:09,759
query and if they all they had was like

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:13,269
a Bert based approach and they might say

00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:14,649
oh trying to debug that would just you

00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:16,749
know be a nightmare because people are

00:33:14,649 --> 00:33:20,080
have a hard time sort of getting under

00:33:16,749 --> 00:33:22,779
the hoods how these things work and so I

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:26,080
think I think we're gonna be in this

00:33:22,779 --> 00:33:28,690
place where there's gonna be an ensemble

00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:32,590
of techniques and just like the

00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:34,210
diverse set of there's a diverse set of

00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:36,910
information needs there's going to be a

00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:40,470
diverse set of treatments for those the

00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:42,790
information needs on the other hand

00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:45,700
where I'm not sure and this is where the

00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:47,860
future is hard to define is you know we

00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,660
talk about a question because there's

00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:53,710
lots of languages being appropriate for

00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:55,630
a transformer model and this this might

00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:58,420
segue into a privacy discussion that

00:33:55,630 --> 00:34:01,810
Trey has a lot of thoughts on but what

00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:03,550
if instead of just the question and we

00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:05,620
move beyond keyword search and we think

00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:09,310
about the whole everything we know about

00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:13,120
the user their location their history

00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:15,730
and we think about that as the input to

00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:20,230
a deep learning model that I'm not sure

00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:22,410
why a kind of complex you know deep

00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:25,090
learning model wouldn't be appropriate

00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:29,200
and then my final thought on the topic

00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:32,230
is one reason that a keyword searches

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:35,680
it's still prevalent and most popular is

00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:38,320
the technology is so commoditized it's

00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:41,590
fast its super reliable we can scale it

00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:43,600
to petabytes of data we can build on top

00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:44,980
of these farce indexes all kinds of

00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:47,470
sophisticated things like knowledge

00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:51,610
graphs that get really close to solving

00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:53,260
the problem Jimmy Lin had who is a

00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:56,560
academic from the University of Waterloo

00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:59,320
had a great paper it was you know sort

00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,600
of I'm taking apart the neural hype and

00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:04,240
saying house and she's a classic query

00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:06,130
expansion gets pretty close to two Burt

00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,380
based approaches he's since written an

00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:13,030
article that says you know neural hype

00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:16,030
maybe is is real at the same time if I

00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:20,640
can have 90% of the value and still work

00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:23,560
on my boring solar elasticsearch cluster

00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:26,110
why would I read and reinvent my soul

00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:28,600
search system to be able to do sort of

00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:32,350
an neural search based approach so

00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:34,300
that's like many complex thoughts but

00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:37,300
yeah the future is uncertain we will see

00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:40,150
yeah any of that that leads into another

00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:42,010
question I must apologize to a couple of

00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,740
people whose questions I missed on slack

00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:45,230
and I've caught

00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:48,010
now but actually what you just said that

00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:54,530
Doug you mentioned a couple of things

00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:56,900
the yen's or James asks how to deal with

00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:59,180
the need of explanatory transparency on

00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,740
machine learning PowerSearch for example

00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:02,420
when the seller wants to understand the

00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:05,599
ranking position of her products in

00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:10,160
e-commerce so here we got is this stuff

00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:11,780
explainable yeah what do you think

00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,210
go ahead sure do you want to go first

00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:15,410
sure yeah um real quick to close that

00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:17,570
thread out I did look at the article

00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:20,570
you're right it was ten percent so just

00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:23,780
to put the transformer models in context

00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:26,660
Google invested tons in this and rolled

00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:29,630
it out is the the biggest innovation in

00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:30,950
their their platform in years and only

00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:33,589
10 percent of Google queries are

00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:36,859
actually using these these language

00:36:33,589 --> 00:36:37,790
transformer models and even of those it

00:36:36,859 --> 00:36:39,680
doesn't help all of them it actually

00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:43,310
hurt some queries like I know personally

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:44,810
I've gone to Google and especially for

00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:46,400
long tail searches like I was mentioning

00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:48,680
I'll type things in and just be

00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,180
incredibly frustrated that I can't just

00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:51,800
find the keyword I'm looking for because

00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:53,750
I know it exists and I just want to find

00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:57,140
Doc's with that keyword but the model is

00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:58,670
just reinterpreting what I'm saying so

00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,960
there's a long way to go I do think that

00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:02,660
10-person is probably going to go up

00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:05,570
significantly over time but I think it

00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:07,099
just reinforces that it's an area that

00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:09,609
helps solve a certain set of problems

00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:15,050
but it's not the panacea for everything

00:37:09,609 --> 00:37:17,510
and I I do think that coming back to

00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:19,609
this notion of explainable mae-eye or

00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:22,970
explainable algorithms here in search

00:37:19,609 --> 00:37:24,470
that there's a lot you know deep

00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:27,859
learning is amazing and we're seeing

00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:30,109
leaps and bounds you know more

00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:32,030
improvements and tons of innovation

00:37:30,109 --> 00:37:34,670
there over the last couple of years and

00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:36,740
then we've seen in a while but the

00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:39,349
models are in general hard to interpret

00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:43,520
hard to explain which is a big problem

00:37:39,349 --> 00:37:45,830
in search and so I think that we're

00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,270
gonna see even if you just go back to

00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:50,210
what I was describing earlier about sort

00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:53,630
of knowledge graphs versus these deep

00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:56,359
learning models I very much believe that

00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:59,809
it's possible to translate

00:37:56,359 --> 00:38:01,519
between keywords and vectors that

00:37:59,809 --> 00:38:04,069
represent those keywords semantically

00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:06,589
and knowledge graphs which represent

00:38:04,069 --> 00:38:08,210
those keywords and and their intent in

00:38:06,589 --> 00:38:10,039
terms of graph relationships there

00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:12,170
they're not all three separate things

00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:14,779
they're just three different ways to

00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:18,349
model information and to the degree that

00:38:14,779 --> 00:38:21,710
we can actually generate all three of

00:38:18,349 --> 00:38:24,619
them automatically it very much seems

00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:27,049
reasonable to me to be able to be able

00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:28,339
to take keywords auto-generate knowledge

00:38:27,049 --> 00:38:30,220
graphs this is something I've worked on

00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:32,499
before with the semantic knowledge graph

00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:35,119
to auto-generate

00:38:32,499 --> 00:38:36,710
vectors that represent the semantic

00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:38,180
meaning what was typed in this is what

00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:40,069
Bert and the other transform of models

00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:41,630
are doing right now and if you can auto

00:38:40,069 --> 00:38:44,089
generate all three of those you can also

00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:46,519
take the documents that connect them and

00:38:44,089 --> 00:38:48,890
use them to interpret one in the context

00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:52,339
of the other so I haven't seen a ton of

00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:55,640
research or even by practical examples

00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:59,450
of this yet but I much expect this

00:38:55,640 --> 00:39:02,839
notion of explainable models to probably

00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:04,430
become easier over time because if you

00:39:02,839 --> 00:39:05,930
can explain one in the context of

00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:08,569
another and one of them is explainable

00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:10,940
at least partially not not a perfect

00:39:08,569 --> 00:39:12,259
match but you can approximate it it's

00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,999
almost like you're building a classifier

00:39:12,259 --> 00:39:16,460
for the deep learning model to tell you

00:39:13,999 --> 00:39:18,619
what kinds of problems that solved is

00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:21,109
the classification I very much think

00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:22,749
that's a I don't call it an easily

00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:25,989
solvable problem but a solvable problem

00:39:22,749 --> 00:39:29,319
and that will allow us to potentially

00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:31,759
use the deep learning models as the

00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:33,650
really complicated model that

00:39:31,759 --> 00:39:35,569
understands everything and then to be

00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:37,160
able to generalize it into much simpler

00:39:35,569 --> 00:39:38,359
models that can be readily deployed and

00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,799
much more easily control of and

00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:44,029
explained so I think that's probably

00:39:39,799 --> 00:39:45,829
what we're going as a field all right

00:39:44,029 --> 00:39:48,230
thanks great so talk what do you think

00:39:45,829 --> 00:39:52,279
how we get it feel to explain to people

00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:57,619
why these models why these high-powered

00:39:52,279 --> 00:39:59,569
models have yeah I think I think so

00:39:57,619 --> 00:40:01,009
there's I think there's a lot of layers

00:39:59,569 --> 00:40:03,970
to this I think one of the most

00:40:01,009 --> 00:40:08,839
important things a search engine can do

00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:09,660
is to reflect back what it thinks your

00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:14,400
intention is

00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:15,780
or or the things it could be more than

00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,809
one thing I think Trey used a good

00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:22,349
example with driver of here are the many

00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:24,030
senses of this I talked about sort of

00:40:22,349 --> 00:40:25,500
just searching for the neverending story

00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:27,180
that seems like a straightforward query

00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,880
but there are many things you could do

00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:33,089
with neverending story watch it watch

00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:37,680
clips just get a nerve you learn about

00:40:33,089 --> 00:40:39,599
it and I often think that sometimes when

00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:42,750
people want explainable ranking that's

00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:45,839
that sometimes what is coming out of

00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:50,640
that and I actually think this is an

00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:53,789
area that is possibly areas around

00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:55,980
intent detection and I see it that

00:40:53,789 --> 00:41:00,240
itself is a huge topic it's not just

00:40:55,980 --> 00:41:03,599
easily put into a bucket but what senses

00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:07,500
of a term people mean is an AI search

00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:09,569
problem that helps to that might be

00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:11,339
deeply complicated to solve and I may

00:41:09,569 --> 00:41:13,799
you can see a situation where I may not

00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:15,240
be able to tell you why I think you mean

00:41:13,799 --> 00:41:18,480
this kind of driver because you're a

00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:19,859
developer but I can at least show you

00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,740
that I think you mean software driver

00:41:19,859 --> 00:41:25,289
and you might infer that's because I'm a

00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:28,740
developer and then it's not a terrible

00:41:25,289 --> 00:41:30,230
thing in that situation to be you're

00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:32,819
completely transparent with the user

00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:34,920
it's better than doing that and and

00:41:32,819 --> 00:41:39,000
being clear that's what you think they

00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:40,680
mean and letting them refine then then

00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:45,359
doing that and then just being infused

00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:47,490
and then I think sometimes within that

00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:52,470
and I think this is probably what Yin's

00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:54,420
is getting at is this idea of well okay

00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:58,529
that's that's perfectly fine we have

00:41:54,420 --> 00:42:00,690
people that their products and people

00:41:58,529 --> 00:42:02,730
have this with SEO and Google I mean

00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:05,099
it'd be great if Google told B why my

00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:06,539
blog article showed up high for certain

00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:10,260
things and not high for other things

00:42:06,539 --> 00:42:12,990
they won't quite do that but for

00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:15,890
businesses we run if many of the

00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:19,400
businesses we run our marketplaces and

00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:22,079
we are often satisfying suppliers and

00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,789
sometimes suppliers our customers in

00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,910
their own right

00:42:23,789 --> 00:42:28,740
job search this is a huge deal and

00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:32,609
people will come in and if they know too

00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:35,270
much about their how things work they

00:42:32,609 --> 00:42:37,410
might actually try to game the system

00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:41,400
that's a huge problem in a lot of search

00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:43,260
systems some blackhat SEO on the other

00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:45,990
hand there's a there is value in

00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:48,450
demonstrating people you know here are

00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:52,200
the things that you can do right so you

00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:53,940
rank high in our search results and to

00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,700
give them a lot of transparency sort of

00:42:53,940 --> 00:43:00,029
in a white hat SEO place because I do

00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:01,859
think that sometimes the secret sauce in

00:43:00,029 --> 00:43:05,369
a search engine is not necessarily the

00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:07,260
technology but the human human and

00:43:05,369 --> 00:43:09,180
organizational dynamics around the

00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:11,190
search engine we're all working really

00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:14,309
hard to make our content rank high in

00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:16,380
Google and Google gut it does give us

00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:19,529
information on what we can do to rank

00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:23,910
high in Google and they do punish us

00:43:19,529 --> 00:43:26,940
when we try to abuse the system so what

00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:28,650
can we do I mean we can probably set up

00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:30,690
an established set of rules and

00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:32,339
standards and then instead of

00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:34,980
necessarily explaining how the model

00:43:32,339 --> 00:43:36,990
works we could say here's how in this

00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:43,079
context here's how you're doing against

00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:44,880
these rules and standards and Tre and I

00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:47,520
both have some experience in job search

00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:49,500
but job search is front and center where

00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,480
you're like is your job posting high

00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:56,819
quality did you list these kinds of

00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:59,279
salary requirements did you are you you

00:43:56,819 --> 00:44:01,049
know listing the skills in a clean way

00:43:59,279 --> 00:44:04,230
that is gonna make things more

00:44:01,049 --> 00:44:05,910
discoverable sure you probably had some

00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:07,920
thoughts on on that I know from your

00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:09,710
career builders game yeah yeah you used

00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:13,770
to run search over Careerbuilder yeah we

00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:15,150
spam or you know job posters wanting to

00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:16,950
game the system so they show up at the

00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:19,349
top of the results was constantly a

00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:23,520
problem so you know we we built some

00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:27,750
custom similarities for for Lusine that

00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:30,809
you know essentially you know if you

00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:33,150
think of the m25 or you know even just

00:44:30,809 --> 00:44:34,890
classical tf-idf where you know as the

00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:36,600
number of times the term increases in

00:44:34,890 --> 00:44:38,550
the document this

00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:41,310
or increases even when diem25 at still

00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:43,590
increases just slowly I can't get into

00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:45,690
the specifics but we definitely you know

00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:47,940
if you crossed a certain threshold your

00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:52,520
illness would actually decrease I mean

00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:54,840
sort of a spam think of it like a spam

00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:56,760
penalize err built into the ranking

00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:59,100
formula because it was necessary because

00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:01,110
you know depending upon which domain and

00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:02,820
context you know if I've got a sales job

00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:04,590
and there's you know millions of sales

00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:06,420
jobs and I would be on the first page

00:45:04,590 --> 00:45:08,280
you just put sales in your document you

00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:09,390
know five thousand times and you're

00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,150
going to be at the top of the first page

00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:15,090
and so you know that though things like

00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:17,280
that are easy to come combat but there's

00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:20,400
also keyword stuffing where you you just

00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,900
want eyeballs it's the the some

00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,520
recruiters it's it's butts and seats

00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:25,050
they just they just need as many people

00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,330
to apply as possible it doesn't matter

00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:29,430
about the specialization so yeah there's

00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:30,990
a lot of ways there we're you know

00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:32,430
machine learning classifiers can't can

00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:35,820
really help in some of the situations as

00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:37,620
well okay so sometimes you want to

00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:40,170
explain things and sometimes explaining

00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:42,390
things may be a bad idea depending on

00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:46,860
the audience yep so we've got another

00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:49,320
question here from Tomas we have is

00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:51,750
implicit feedback data enough to train a

00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:53,070
semantic search model and if not what

00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:54,690
else can be helpful if you want to

00:45:53,070 --> 00:46:00,540
exceed the performance of the text-based

00:45:54,690 --> 00:46:02,160
search engine I think I think yes but a

00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:04,410
I'd be interested because you I know you

00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,840
are a passion of yours is building

00:46:04,410 --> 00:46:09,240
knowledge graphs automatically yeah he's

00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:10,770
very semantic search related yeah yeah

00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,510
so so I have this debate with people all

00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:14,700
the time about what semantic search

00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:17,310
means you know semantics is just this

00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:19,290
meaning so any kind of search where

00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:21,000
you're better understanding the meaning

00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:22,830
or the intent the users really semantic

00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:24,810
search historically there's been

00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:27,200
knowledge graphs is a way to solve that

00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:32,010
more recently the Transformers and

00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:34,440
didn't inspector stuff but if you peel

00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:36,630
it back there's lots of different

00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:38,850
specific problems I think of them as

00:46:36,630 --> 00:46:41,160
building blocks that go into making a

00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:44,100
semantic search system for example you

00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:46,050
need to understand specific phrases so

00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:47,820
that you're not parsing every key word

00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:49,420
out as an individual piece of text but

00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:52,720
you're understanding when words

00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:56,230
or phrases and so let's take that one

00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:58,540
problem how am I tied identify phrases

00:46:56,230 --> 00:47:01,630
well I could take all of my texts and I

00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:03,220
could mine my text and try to use but

00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:05,290
first this is the improbable phrases or

00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:07,569
any number of techniques to identify

00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:09,579
phrases from my text but I'm gonna have

00:47:07,569 --> 00:47:10,839
a lot of noise there the other way I

00:47:09,579 --> 00:47:13,540
could do is I could look at my query

00:47:10,839 --> 00:47:15,640
logs so if somebody comes in they are

00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:18,609
consistently typing software engineer

00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:20,799
over and over as a phrase then I can

00:47:18,609 --> 00:47:22,420
from mine and my query logs and realize

00:47:20,799 --> 00:47:23,920
that that is a domain-specific phrase

00:47:22,420 --> 00:47:26,470
that I need to learn the meaning of and

00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:30,520
I can add it to a list and that list can

00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:31,690
be then be used so that anytime somebody

00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:34,630
comes into the future they type in that

00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:36,670
phrase I can identify this a phrase the

00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:38,440
implicit nature of that if you're

00:47:36,670 --> 00:47:40,150
talking about you know user signals and

00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:42,250
what the users are doing is certainly

00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:43,359
enough to solve that problem it also saw

00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,890
with documents or you could solve it

00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:46,839
with both and then look at the

00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:48,670
intersection of what is both in your

00:47:46,839 --> 00:47:50,500
content and also your users are

00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:52,720
searching for and then you get a really

00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:55,599
nice clean list that matches both the

00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:59,410
supply and the demand that's one problem

00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:01,000
take another problem misspellings so if

00:47:59,410 --> 00:48:02,410
I want identify misspellings and search

00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,630
I can look at my documents which are

00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:06,339
full of lots of words and if I recommend

00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:10,540
spelling Corrections for my documents

00:48:06,339 --> 00:48:11,980
they might look a little crazy but just

00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:13,540
with a lot of noise I could do the same

00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:17,369
thing I can by my query logs

00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:20,290
anytime somebody typed in ma nger

00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:21,940
and then you know ten seconds or five

00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:24,760
seconds or two seconds later typed in in

00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:26,319
a in a ger so correcting manger to

00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:28,299
manager because they misspelled tit I

00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:29,530
can use that and build a machine

00:48:28,299 --> 00:48:31,480
learning model that can automatically

00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:34,599
learn spelling Corrections from commonly

00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:37,299
misspelled terms from that implicit data

00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:39,480
form for my user signals and that tends

00:48:37,299 --> 00:48:42,640
to generate some of the best

00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:45,010
misspellings correct spelling correction

00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:47,140
list for given domain assuming you have

00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:48,400
enough signals and I can further go down

00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:51,540
that list you can look at you know

00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:54,010
automatic query rewrites you can look at

00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:55,569
synonym expansion identifying synonyms

00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:57,400
you like you could sort of go through

00:48:55,569 --> 00:48:59,740
each of these I'll call them NLP

00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:01,720
problems there they're search in LP

00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:02,730
problems you go through each of them one

00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:04,560
by one

00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:06,450
most of the time you can solve them

00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:09,180
either with your content or with your

00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:11,850
sick user signals and optimally with

00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:13,920
both and so the short answer to the

00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:16,609
question I think it's yes you can

00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:20,070
absolutely leverage implicit judgments

00:49:16,609 --> 00:49:22,140
to automatically generate these building

00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:24,390
blocks that are necessary to build out a

00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:26,790
semantic search system the higher you

00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:28,440
set your thresholds in terms of number

00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:30,600
of users running the searches and

00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:33,180
what-have-you the higher quality goes to

00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:35,460
the point where if you go really really

00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:37,650
high then you have almost no noise but

00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:39,720
you're missing a lot of inputs so where

00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:41,670
I think the the human element happens to

00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:43,340
come in there is if you don't have

00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:45,840
enough signals you're gonna have to

00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:47,430
augment it with with your understanding

00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:50,520
if you don't have enough content you

00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:52,290
know the same kind of thing but you know

00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:54,960
I absolutely believe you can build a

00:49:52,290 --> 00:49:57,540
semantic search system without a lot of

00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,130
manual input assuming you've got enough

00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:00,900
traffic and assuming that you've got

00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:02,460
enough data if you don't have enough

00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,320
data and/or you don't have enough

00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:11,220
traffic then you don't have a lot of

00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:13,230
options yeah I think I think I think a

00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:14,640
lot of people once I think there's like

00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:16,619
this sweet spot where there's a

00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:21,210
combination of sort of an unsupervised

00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:22,920
data source like Wikipedia or you know

00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:26,910
maybe that's what starters start a point

00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:29,040
for your own corpus and semantics that

00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:30,660
might whatever semantic search assets

00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,820
that turns into whether it's a knowledge

00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:35,430
graph or like some vector based model

00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:36,600
like Berger word avec that can be off to

00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:39,720
be a good starter point for a lot of

00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:41,520
people but the the real magic happens

00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:44,390
when you can combine that with your own

00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:48,720
query logs and behavioral signals and

00:50:44,390 --> 00:50:50,930
you can draw connections between this

00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:54,270
phrase we saw an interaction between

00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:56,760
this phrase or concept which I might

00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:58,710
recognize from like Wikimedia but in

00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:01,440
this context that's connected to this

00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:03,420
kind of document which may be in some

00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,820
kind of vector space it clusters over

00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:08,220
here which is a little bit different

00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:10,290
than Wikimedia so you learn these like

00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:13,440
almost geometric relationships between

00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:15,630
the phrases in your queries and your

00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,460
specific purpose which may be a little

00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:17,960
bit different

00:51:16,460 --> 00:51:20,060
then might what might be in like a

00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:24,710
wikipedia or some other starter server

00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:26,930
set that's almost like thinking about it

00:51:24,710 --> 00:51:29,300
maybe from how you might start with a

00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:32,570
simple word defect or glove or or

00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:34,070
something like that I also think about

00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:35,810
semantic search in terms of the

00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:38,000
hierarchy if I'm thinking about this

00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:40,640
purely from a text-based point of view I

00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:44,150
like to think about this as as a

00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:45,740
hierarchy and you people always start

00:51:44,150 --> 00:51:47,900
with keywords we have keywords right I

00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:50,630
think the next level what can keywords

00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:54,230
is phrase detection to phrase detection

00:51:50,630 --> 00:51:57,320
being sort of basic collocations like I

00:51:54,230 --> 00:52:00,890
can detect that I could do compounding D

00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:03,530
compounding I can detect common phrases

00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:06,890
I can see that a I powered search is a

00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:08,780
phrase without necessarily tying it to

00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:10,609
any conceptual relationships I just know

00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:15,170
there is a thing called a I powered

00:52:10,609 --> 00:52:16,880
search and then I think you move up from

00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:18,470
that and people will start to think in

00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,510
terms of taxonomy Zoar manage

00:52:18,470 --> 00:52:25,390
vocabularies which tend to be in my mind

00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:29,330
hierarchical and where that has a lot of

00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:30,560
you can you can learn these things and

00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:32,000
it's funny because you know what do you

00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:33,830
call machine learning what do you call a

00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,770
I you know AI is what you call machine

00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:39,050
learning and PowerPoint right a lot of

00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:41,080
these things are just statistics and you

00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:45,589
can find statistical patterns both

00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:49,099
inquiries and and your own corpus that

00:52:45,589 --> 00:52:51,140
that point at these things when you move

00:52:49,099 --> 00:52:53,030
up to management Cabul areas or taxonomy

00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:56,000
x' and you're thinking about things

00:52:53,030 --> 00:52:58,720
hierarchically there are algorithms that

00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,920
could look at this - I gave a talk

00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:03,080
leucine revolution many years ago I

00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:05,420
think it's called it's a mouthful I

00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:07,550
think it's called taxonomical magical

00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:09,710
semantical search or something but it

00:53:07,550 --> 00:53:11,810
was about this concept of sort of

00:53:09,710 --> 00:53:15,320
automatically deriving hierarchical

00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:18,710
taxonomy as out of a corpus and grier

00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:20,839
logs and those are straightforward

00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:22,550
tricks just more or less based on

00:53:20,839 --> 00:53:25,540
statistical significance and set math

00:53:22,550 --> 00:53:30,380
right you can do a lot with simple math

00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:32,990
and what's nice about even there is that

00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:36,590
before you get into any complicated sort

00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:39,530
of relational things between concepts a

00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:42,500
lot of how people search tends to be in

00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:44,690
this hierarchical fashion I think it's

00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:47,090
really interesting that if you go to a

00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:49,190
medical search engine and none of us are

00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:51,770
doctors and what are we going to search

00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:53,840
for to see if their search is any good

00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:55,070
we're probably gonna tech cancer we're

00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:58,310
gonna type I don't know

00:53:55,070 --> 00:54:00,800
Tylenol that's probably not what an

00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:03,890
experienced user of that system searches

00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:05,810
and so what happens is we often strike

00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:09,020
out with very broad queries that tend to

00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:11,540
say that this high level of semantical I

00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:14,120
guess you would say broadness a lot of

00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:15,530
head queries are this way and we're

00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:17,450
gonna you know we talk to started

00:54:15,530 --> 00:54:20,090
talking about diversity and I'm gonna do

00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:21,410
the diversity panel later this week that

00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:24,650
I hope everyone comes to this is going

00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:26,630
to be awesome but when you do that

00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:28,910
initial strikeout query something that's

00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:31,730
hierarchical can say okay here all the

00:54:28,910 --> 00:54:33,740
senses of what that intention might

00:54:31,730 --> 00:54:35,390
relate to and there are many ways of

00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:37,400
thinking about a hierarchy of intentions

00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:41,840
maybe different actions maybe it's

00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:43,490
different concepts but cancer oh we have

00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:45,710
all this stuff on you know all these

00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:47,690
different kinds of cancers and you might

00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:49,730
start to register in your mind you're

00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:51,800
learning the vocabulary that the system

00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:53,900
understands as you're searching these

00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:56,660
broad terms and then you refine people

00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:58,340
often refine more narrowly into more

00:54:56,660 --> 00:55:00,440
refined narrower and narrower concepts

00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:02,570
and as you get narrower and narrower it

00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:04,610
becomes less of a let me show you all

00:55:02,570 --> 00:55:06,800
that the possible intentions that you

00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:08,660
might have and more about truly like

00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:12,080
relevance ranking where it's like let me

00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:14,120
try to get you close as possible to what

00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:16,610
you're actually saying has that you've

00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:20,360
seemed to really strongly knowing what

00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:22,970
you want and then I think the next layer

00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:24,680
in the hierarchy is the knowledge graphs

00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:27,460
that you know trace sort of alluded to

00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:31,010
before where you get into relational

00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:34,280
inferences between different concepts

00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:35,900
and all of these things I think the best

00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:38,990
way to do them is a combination of

00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:41,510
implicit data and I would say or

00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:43,790
implicit data from your query logs and I

00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:47,600
would say probably two sources of

00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:49,730
of unsupervised text corpus data which

00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:52,100
is something outside this your search

00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:54,140
system because that might represent more

00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:57,560
what the naive searcher is doing and

00:55:54,140 --> 00:56:00,560
something related to your corpus because

00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:01,880
that's going to get at what your at

00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:03,560
least what the people who produce your

00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:05,330
content think your search system is

00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:09,200
about it's sort of the intersection of

00:56:05,330 --> 00:56:11,810
the three things are often helping most

00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:15,970
helpful or getting at at that most

00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:18,470
common sense yeah I would say the

00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:21,560
depending on the domain and how

00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:23,090
specialized it is the referencing

00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:25,150
something like you know the Wikipedia

00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:28,370
corpus or you know any sort of external

00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:32,390
knowledge based can either be incredibly

00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:34,160
useful or incredibly non useful under

00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:35,660
good point it yeah because the the words

00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:38,450
can take on entirely different meanings

00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:41,000
to depending upon the specialization so

00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:42,860
if if you you know and I would even tie

00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,930
this back to the transformer models in

00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:46,660
some ways but when I think of the

00:56:44,930 --> 00:56:50,000
vectors that come out of those models

00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:53,120
they're essentially modeling two kinds

00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:56,840
of things they're modeling the ability

00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:58,970
to understand language generally and

00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:00,680
then they're modeling the an

00:56:58,970 --> 00:57:03,410
understanding of the relationships

00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:05,480
between the text and the items that are

00:57:03,410 --> 00:57:08,570
in the domain that the model was trained

00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:10,310
on and so you take out of the box and

00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:12,260
throw it in your search engine and it's

00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:14,090
gonna do a really good job at in

00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:18,310
understanding questions understanding

00:57:14,090 --> 00:57:20,870
people places things general kinds of

00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:24,110
linguistic relationships between things

00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:27,350
let's call them but if you're dealing

00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:30,350
with a you know you know if you're

00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:31,910
dealing with bio you know biomed if

00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:35,240
you're dealing with you know careers if

00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:38,720
you're dealing with medical I get any

00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:40,760
very specific domain if if the bird

00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:42,050
model was trained on a general corpus

00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:44,240
it's not going to do well at all in

00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:45,650
terms of those things unless you do some

00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:48,710
transfer learning on content from the

00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:51,340
domains so I think that general rule

00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:53,810
applies regardless of what kind of

00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:56,000
technique you're using if you're

00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:57,590
building a web search engine then

00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,210
Wikipedia is going to be awesome

00:57:57,590 --> 00:58:02,300
if you're building a very specific

00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:05,090
finance vertical website it's gonna

00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:07,700
probably be very misleading I think we

00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:10,100
saw that just what quick comment on that

00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:13,250
we saw that my colleague max Irwin built

00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:16,040
a search engine using open source

00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:18,470
connections blog and I forget what it

00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:19,940
was that he searched for maybe you know

00:58:18,470 --> 00:58:22,910
maybe it was solar I don't know if this

00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:25,490
is it but you typed in solar and there

00:58:22,910 --> 00:58:29,140
is definitely a bias towards light and

00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:32,600
light based things because Solar Sol are

00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:35,660
you know seem to be slightly tie to

00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:39,140
solar panels and you know Solar is a

00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:41,120
fairly unique term in our domain that

00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:43,910
means nothing that the in the general

00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:45,560
sense oh I thought that was there's all

00:58:43,910 --> 00:58:47,000
kinds of stories like that that every

00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:49,640
time it's funny yet we have the same

00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,900
exact stories ten years ago when we were

00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:52,910
playing with latent semantic indexing

00:58:50,900 --> 00:58:55,400
sort of naively trained on a general

00:58:52,910 --> 00:58:57,850
purpose - so it's it's gotten better but

00:58:55,400 --> 00:59:00,920
it's sort of the same lessons

00:58:57,850 --> 00:59:02,300
Frank's good thanks so I just wanted to

00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:04,520
move on to another question here and

00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:05,600
there may be a short answer to this one

00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:08,600
there may be a lot of answers so a

00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:10,970
teacher asks no matter of search is

00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:12,710
powered by a I machine learning or

00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:14,960
normal search isn't it true that the

00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:16,400
data the source data that decides the

00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,590
quality of your search so if the data's

00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,720
not clean no matter what you invest in

00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:23,660
you may never get your desired results

00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:29,420
or do you think a high powered search

00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:31,070
could could outsmart this do you want

00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:33,890
take that dog would you want me to well

00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:36,800
yeah if by data we mean training data

00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:40,160
that's that's absolutely true I mean

00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:44,420
it's very much garbage in garbage out if

00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:49,640
we're supervised problems if we mean the

00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:52,460
corpus itself well maybe I mean I I

00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:54,590
think about basically the semantic

00:59:52,460 --> 01:00:00,310
search conversation we were just having

00:59:54,590 --> 01:00:04,940
and let's say I'm searching I'm

01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:10,700
searching music by mood now you could

01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:11,520
say is the are the songs bad because you

01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:13,530
know Spotify

01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:16,650
whoever didn't label them all by mood

01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:19,670
and that is a bad data problem or is it

01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:23,550
that we have to find the vector space

01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:27,600
that maps between the query of the mood

01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:31,890
queries and the in the audio and there

01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:36,000
is some way to learn that a sad song

01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:37,860
look that a sad song if we if someone

01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:43,290
searches for sad and they click on

01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:44,940
certain songs then we can you know sort

01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:48,690
of get an association between that

01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:50,340
concept of sad and a certain kind of

01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:54,810
song that there seems to be some

01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:57,390
commonality and then we have we solved a

01:00:54,810 --> 01:01:00,440
data quality problem I mean you could

01:00:57,390 --> 01:01:03,930
extend that to like really terrible data

01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:05,220
that someone's put I mean another place

01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:06,930
where people have data equality

01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:09,630
challenges might the enterprise search

01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:11,730
because enterprise search is kind of

01:01:09,630 --> 01:01:14,730
always unloved by everyone who wants to

01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:16,650
use it it's it's a place where people

01:01:14,730 --> 01:01:19,530
will just write content they're not even

01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:21,240
caring about it being searchable and

01:01:19,530 --> 01:01:23,820
it's the same kind of thing where it's

01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:27,120
like when someone searches for TPS

01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:28,620
report okay what kinds of things are

01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:31,140
they interacting with and can we learn

01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:34,740
almost a relationship between a set of

01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:36,570
queries and what a TPS report or a

01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:41,280
report might even mean

01:01:36,570 --> 01:01:43,440
so yeah yeah completely agree the I

01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:46,230
think of search in a lot of ways is

01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:48,240
supply and demand right the the demand

01:01:46,230 --> 01:01:50,240
is the queries coming in from end users

01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:53,400
and the supply is the documents you have

01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:55,770
it's entirely possible to build models

01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:58,530
that interpret the users query based

01:01:55,770 --> 01:01:59,820
upon what they meant and then when you

01:01:58,530 --> 01:02:01,410
go to actually execute the search you

01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:03,900
get no results so you get very few

01:02:01,410 --> 01:02:07,350
results so the this is still important

01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:10,320
that your content itself is I would use

01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:12,630
the word clean I would just say it's

01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:14,040
there and you can access it and you know

01:02:12,630 --> 01:02:19,140
that your model can map into it in some

01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:21,360
way but yeah if you can't train the

01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:23,940
model to understand your users intent at

01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:25,410
all then you end up with the I'm just

01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:26,820
going to throw some keywords at a search

01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:28,500
engine and hope the bag of words in

01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:31,530
diem25 gives me what I'm looking for

01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:34,770
which is not an invalid approach it's

01:02:31,530 --> 01:02:36,840
just a bit data at this point oh yeah

01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:39,030
like optimally your models are clean and

01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:39,510
your data is clean and then everybody's

01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:41,280
happy

01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:46,410
but sometimes you have to take what you

01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:50,850
can get thank you thank you so moving on

01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:54,300
we have a question from Filipe how do

01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:56,850
you feel ai powers a high-powered search

01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:58,860
could impact personalized search duties

01:02:56,850 --> 01:03:03,840
do you see search get even closer to

01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:07,580
real-time recommendations you want to

01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:10,260
take that tray first I'll take it so I

01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:12,570
think of so the goal of the search

01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:17,280
engines to you know I guess academically

01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:20,040
to MA you know help the user with their

01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:21,480
information need right I think of it as

01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:23,250
you know we need to understand the users

01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:25,500
intent and then we need to you know

01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:29,430
return results that match that intent

01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:31,080
and so I think of user intent in three

01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:32,820
dimensions the the content understanding

01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:36,300
the user understanding of domain

01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:38,850
understanding on the user understanding

01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:42,000
you know somebody comes to my website

01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:43,980
let's say I'm like Best Buy for example

01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:47,970
somebody comes to my website and they

01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:49,500
search for a you know they search for a

01:03:47,970 --> 01:03:51,300
refrigerator and then they start

01:03:49,500 --> 01:03:52,980
clicking on results and they click on

01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:54,020
three different refrigerators that are

01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:56,580
all stainless steel

01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:58,410
maybe they click on five you know four

01:03:56,580 --> 01:04:00,780
of them are by samsung the other ones by

01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:02,640
some other brand and then they come back

01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:05,660
you know an hour later and they search

01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:09,240
the website for microwave should I a

01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:11,160
return them a generic microwave or B

01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:15,180
return them a stainless steel microwave

01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:16,560
made by Samsung maybe all of the results

01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:18,120
are exactly the same it's just how you

01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:20,850
rank them the ones you show at the top

01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:22,740
of the list I would argue in most cases

01:04:20,850 --> 01:04:25,530
as long as you're showing the same

01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:27,210
results moving the ones at the top of

01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:29,940
the list that we believe the users most

01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:31,170
likely to be interested in probably

01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:34,230
makes the most sense if you're trying to

01:04:31,170 --> 01:04:35,760
you know land a sale now there's nuances

01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:38,000
of that you don't want them to then go

01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,000
search for

01:04:38,770 --> 01:04:45,190
i phone and then you know get a samsung

01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:46,540
you know i samsung phone coming up

01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:48,280
instead because we've learned that they

01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:49,510
prefer the brand samsung you know like

01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:52,900
so there's things like that you have to

01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:54,790
be very careful about but the it when

01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:55,660
you say AI PowerSearch vs. personalized

01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:58,599
search i would actually say that

01:04:55,660 --> 01:05:00,160
personalized search is a key part of a I

01:04:58,599 --> 01:05:02,440
powered search so in the book there

01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:03,609
there's a whole you know chapter in

01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:05,290
section we talk about collaborative

01:05:03,609 --> 01:05:07,570
filtering and real-time recommendations

01:05:05,290 --> 01:05:09,190
and and personalized search that that's

01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:11,200
that's a key aspect of what we're

01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:13,810
tackling in the book and and really

01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:16,420
focusing on of course how you do it but

01:05:13,810 --> 01:05:18,400
more so how do you do it in such a way

01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:20,560
that you don't mess up the other search

01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:22,450
results like the the phone example I

01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:23,920
gave you where you know we don't want to

01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:27,520
return a Samsung phone for an iPhone

01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:29,109
search because out of all of the areas

01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:32,770
of a I powered search I would say that

01:05:29,109 --> 01:05:36,550
personalization is the one where you're

01:05:32,770 --> 01:05:38,790
the most likely to really mess up and if

01:05:36,550 --> 01:05:40,990
your users angry because you're

01:05:38,790 --> 01:05:42,369
personalizing the results to them but

01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:43,990
they may not want that and especially

01:05:42,369 --> 01:05:46,510
given the context it may actually make

01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:48,640
the results worse and so so yeah it's

01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:51,880
it's I think you should do it in a very

01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:53,170
nuanced way that can help the user see

01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:54,609
at the top of the list the things that

01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:57,040
they are definitely the most interested

01:05:54,609 --> 01:05:59,680
in while not overstepping to essentially

01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:03,790
become recommendations that override

01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:06,250
with users actually telling you yeah I I

01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:08,920
couldn't agree more I think it's it's a

01:06:06,250 --> 01:06:11,500
tricky area and I think especially as we

01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:13,540
get into this world of being conscious

01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:16,619
about privacy which I know Trey is an

01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:19,839
area you're passionate about but I think

01:06:16,619 --> 01:06:22,810
yeah I think I think a lot about the I

01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:24,460
think a lot about it's nice when I see a

01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:26,320
recommendation system and it's very

01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:29,710
transparently a recommendation system

01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:32,849
and it's it's this we have we have based

01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:35,500
on your browsing history or similar to

01:06:32,849 --> 01:06:37,119
this specific item or items like this

01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:39,730
that we think you specifically would

01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:41,710
like then it's like okay I'm logged in

01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:44,410
to this website it has my history I know

01:06:41,710 --> 01:06:46,900
it it what it knows about me and I have

01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:50,800
a sense for what this piece of the UI is

01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:52,510
is based on when I use search that's a

01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:55,300
different proposition you

01:06:52,510 --> 01:06:58,150
is what I it's like when I walk into I

01:06:55,300 --> 01:07:00,970
mean every people use this metaphor a

01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:05,170
lot but when you walk into a store and

01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:09,100
you see the clerk and you say I kind of

01:07:05,170 --> 01:07:12,550
want to know what you're you know show

01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:14,830
me your washing machines or or what

01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:17,770
maybe a better example to be fashioned

01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:20,350
like I want to buy a sports jacket now

01:07:17,770 --> 01:07:22,359
it's super important that they take you

01:07:20,350 --> 01:07:23,560
to the sports jacket aisle and they show

01:07:22,359 --> 01:07:26,950
you the I'm showing you this because

01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:29,170
their sports jackets sort of a little

01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:31,900
you know the gravy on top as if the

01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:34,630
salesperson might somehow remember you

01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:37,960
and and you have a relationship with

01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:42,369
this person and they are able to sort of

01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:45,369
maybe make some suggestions but you

01:07:42,369 --> 01:07:48,130
wonder if a that should be called out

01:07:45,369 --> 01:07:49,840
explicitly in the search somehow or B

01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:53,140
that should almost be it like off to the

01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:54,700
side as like a sidebar UI as like you

01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:57,070
know as we were saying search your eyes

01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:59,710
are evolving pretty rapidly right now

01:07:57,070 --> 01:08:02,890
it's not just a 10 hotlinks it could be

01:07:59,710 --> 01:08:04,480
like here's 10 hot links for or here's

01:08:02,890 --> 01:08:08,130
four hot links or whatever here's a grid

01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:10,450
of sports jackets over to the side

01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:14,170
sports jackets based on your browsing

01:08:10,450 --> 01:08:17,620
history and I think a lot about if we're

01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:19,799
reflecting back to the user that's sort

01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:22,569
of an interpretation of their intent and

01:08:19,799 --> 01:08:24,850
making that conversation very

01:08:22,569 --> 01:08:27,180
transparent about here's what I put in

01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:31,420
and I am I getting out what I want and

01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:32,739
are they showing me are they explaining

01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:34,960
why they're showing me what they're

01:08:32,739 --> 01:08:38,400
showing me and if they start doing

01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:41,500
something crazy then I'm gonna become

01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:44,290
sort of increasingly distrustful of the

01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:46,450
of the system not only from a relevance

01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:50,980
perspective but also just from a trust

01:08:46,450 --> 01:08:55,509
perspective Thanks

01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:57,310
I love a question here that I think doc

01:08:55,509 --> 01:09:02,410
maybe you would have made one for you

01:08:57,310 --> 01:09:04,540
but John asked John Reith asks where

01:09:02,410 --> 01:09:05,530
should a team starts in trying to get a

01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:07,180
high-powered

01:09:05,530 --> 01:09:13,300
what is the best point of entry and the

01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:16,390
greatest value for the efforts where

01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:18,450
should a team start yeah I think that's

01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:22,990
a great obviously by your book

01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:25,000
yeah by all the books you know I think

01:09:22,990 --> 01:09:27,670
the for me I think one of the the

01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:29,260
biggest things there's a lot of things

01:09:27,670 --> 01:09:32,350
there's a lot of places you could start

01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:35,290
I think one of the biggest things you

01:09:32,350 --> 01:09:39,580
should be doing is thinking about the

01:09:35,290 --> 01:09:42,000
pipeline between our users your users

01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:45,160
interactions with search results and

01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:48,100
translating that into sort of a ground

01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:50,920
through set that's a great place to

01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:54,910
start because you know that is going to

01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:56,530
be the that is going to be the source

01:09:54,910 --> 01:09:57,790
sort of the foundation of anything you

01:09:56,530 --> 01:10:01,180
do a search you're gonna be able to

01:09:57,790 --> 01:10:05,200
evaluate offline whatever crazy ideas

01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:08,200
you have I think you're organism and if

01:10:05,200 --> 01:10:10,240
you do that you can also another area

01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:11,830
that I see people start that's not super

01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:14,770
heavyweight and not super heavyweight

01:10:11,830 --> 01:10:18,370
analytics is with really simple intent

01:10:14,770 --> 01:10:21,130
detection and detection like I said can

01:10:18,370 --> 01:10:23,740
be a broad broad category but simple

01:10:21,130 --> 01:10:26,280
things like I know you want things in

01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:29,050
this category because I see that people

01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:31,870
often click this facet where when

01:10:29,050 --> 01:10:33,160
prompted to do this thing they take this

01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:36,670
action so I'm just gonna take that

01:10:33,160 --> 01:10:40,060
action for you like that's like a really

01:10:36,670 --> 01:10:42,850
simple training set for a pretty I mean

01:10:40,060 --> 01:10:44,350
that's a pretty well solved NLP problem

01:10:42,850 --> 01:10:49,960
for a long time we don't need

01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:52,930
transformers even for that and I think

01:10:49,960 --> 01:10:55,180
those are like those are almost like 2

01:10:52,930 --> 01:10:56,680
bits if you started with those two

01:10:55,180 --> 01:11:00,520
things then you'd have sort of the

01:10:56,680 --> 01:11:01,630
foundation for with the with the sort of

01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:04,630
the judgments and everything you'd have

01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:06,730
the foundation for doing learning to

01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:07,810
rank basically and then with the other

01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:10,540
side you're starting to get the

01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:13,030
foundation for doing more complex things

01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:15,280
understanding queries and sort of the

01:11:13,030 --> 01:11:19,200
sort of than semantic search side of

01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:22,180
things almost and

01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:25,900
that what you want that that's a great

01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:30,400
place to get started the hardest thing

01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:32,110
that you'll you'll find is when you get

01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:33,730
to this place of thinking about machine

01:11:32,110 --> 01:11:35,800
learning I often think when an executive

01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:37,810
thinks about machine learning or you

01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:40,330
know someone in a high-level role what

01:11:37,810 --> 01:11:41,890
they really are thinking about is I want

01:11:40,330 --> 01:11:45,010
to be extremely data-driven

01:11:41,890 --> 01:11:47,380
in our company's thinking and machine

01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:51,970
learning is sort of like by a definition

01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:54,280
data-driven but I think as you get

01:11:51,970 --> 01:11:56,890
started and start having successes you

01:11:54,280 --> 01:11:58,870
can actually start to steer some of the

01:11:56,890 --> 01:12:00,100
things that get in the way of machine

01:11:58,870 --> 01:12:02,530
learning based search which is the

01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:03,730
culture of the organization with some of

01:12:02,530 --> 01:12:05,530
these things and this has been true of

01:12:03,730 --> 01:12:07,380
search relevance not just is she

01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:09,640
learning you know a high-powered search

01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:11,020
you've you kind of have to get the

01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:14,020
organization in this mindset of being

01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:15,160
very experimentally driven because

01:12:14,020 --> 01:12:16,540
you're going to find that you're going

01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:17,590
to try some things you're gonna work

01:12:16,540 --> 01:12:20,260
your you try some things you're not

01:12:17,590 --> 01:12:24,130
going to work and it's got to be okay to

01:12:20,260 --> 01:12:26,920
have the foundation for her trying and

01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:28,660
experimenting and and failing and then

01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:30,520
learning from your failures and then

01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:32,260
moving on the next thing you want to do

01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:34,570
that quickly and not spend six months

01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:36,340
you know building something and then

01:12:34,570 --> 01:12:40,060
getting into production realizing it you

01:12:36,340 --> 01:12:42,070
know it failed at AP test yeah makes

01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:45,730
sense and it obviously say to the you

01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:48,430
know where should you start we obviously

01:12:45,730 --> 01:12:50,380
you know as they said by the book and

01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:52,720
for my marketing had on for a second I

01:12:50,380 --> 01:12:55,990
think actually Manning that's a couple

01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:58,060
of free ebook codes for the book so

01:12:55,990 --> 01:13:00,730
maybe afterwards we can go through all

01:12:58,060 --> 01:13:02,920
the questions and the slack channel and

01:13:00,730 --> 01:13:05,050
you know give a couple of those out to

01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:08,110
people so there's an incentive to post

01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:11,080
some more good questions everybody but I

01:13:08,110 --> 01:13:13,420
do think the other piece of it is with

01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:16,000
any technology decision you you do have

01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:17,470
a build purses by decision so you know

01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:18,940
if you've got an internal search team

01:13:17,470 --> 01:13:20,080
that's really good and you've got a

01:13:18,940 --> 01:13:23,440
bunch of data scientists and they're

01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:24,520
ready to go then you know look at the

01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:26,230
book look at the techniques they're

01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:28,480
develop your own techniques and hit the

01:13:26,230 --> 01:13:30,610
ground running a lot of organizations

01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:32,409
there's a small search team they don't

01:13:30,610 --> 01:13:34,419
have the

01:13:32,409 --> 01:13:37,300
the internal expertise and it's it's

01:13:34,419 --> 01:13:39,070
hard to come by so you know I would say

01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:40,869
reach out to somebody you know like an

01:13:39,070 --> 01:13:42,909
open source connections or like a search

01:13:40,869 --> 01:13:45,369
kernel or like you know whoever and they

01:13:42,909 --> 01:13:47,019
can probably help you build you know the

01:13:45,369 --> 01:13:49,570
third option is you know there's lots of

01:13:47,019 --> 01:13:51,010
vendors out there building enterprise

01:13:49,570 --> 01:13:54,099
software that does a lot of these things

01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:55,719
already you know I I just came from

01:13:54,099 --> 01:13:57,309
lucid works and you know they're their

01:13:55,719 --> 01:14:00,010
fusion product does it you know there's

01:13:57,309 --> 01:14:01,059
other competitors as well so you kind of

01:14:00,010 --> 01:14:02,829
have to figure out what's best for your

01:14:01,059 --> 01:14:05,110
business if you just want to put your

01:14:02,829 --> 01:14:06,729
toe in the water and get started you

01:14:05,110 --> 01:14:08,289
know we can definitely help with that

01:14:06,729 --> 01:14:10,389
that the book I think we'll walk you

01:14:08,289 --> 01:14:13,780
through that there's lots of resources

01:14:10,389 --> 01:14:15,689
out there but uh but yeah it's um it's a

01:14:13,780 --> 01:14:18,579
lot of fun and a lot of investment but I

01:14:15,689 --> 01:14:20,739
usually in the end you come out much

01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:22,059
better off by automating this stuff and

01:14:20,739 --> 01:14:25,179
making your systems more intelligent

01:14:22,059 --> 01:14:27,039
then by you know manually tuning and

01:14:25,179 --> 01:14:33,550
building large teams of manual tuners

01:14:27,039 --> 01:14:36,130
for years so in my experience I will

01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:38,409
have actually just an additional comment

01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:41,139
that I think when you have started your

01:14:38,409 --> 01:14:42,639
journey talk about it talk about it I

01:14:41,139 --> 01:14:44,139
suppose it's you know even if you're

01:14:42,639 --> 01:14:44,800
starting the very beginning document

01:14:44,139 --> 01:14:46,269
your mistakes

01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:48,099
tell the rest of us how you're getting

01:14:46,269 --> 01:14:50,169
on and come back to an event like this

01:14:48,099 --> 01:14:51,309
perhaps and tell us all your successes

01:14:50,169 --> 01:14:52,959
and failures because I mean that's a

01:14:51,309 --> 01:14:55,119
hugely important thing that people need

01:14:52,959 --> 01:14:57,760
to share their experiences so we can all

01:14:55,119 --> 01:14:58,959
learn yeah yeah I'm sure both Doug and I

01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,639
would would say that we've learned a lot

01:14:58,959 --> 01:15:03,489
more from other people trying things and

01:15:00,639 --> 01:15:07,119
failing and succeeding then you know

01:15:03,489 --> 01:15:09,880
from our own failures and successes we

01:15:07,119 --> 01:15:11,650
want to learn from you and also the

01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:13,030
people who are best equipped often to

01:15:11,650 --> 01:15:16,179
talk or write about something are the

01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:19,709
people doing it in for the first time

01:15:16,179 --> 01:15:22,630
and because after you've done it were

01:15:19,709 --> 01:15:25,449
twenty years or however long you sort of

01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:27,909
like it's become second nature to you

01:15:25,449 --> 01:15:29,949
and it's like try and do I once I

01:15:27,909 --> 01:15:32,949
recently had to explain some long

01:15:29,949 --> 01:15:34,869
division to my son or something and it's

01:15:32,949 --> 01:15:38,070
like oh I can know how to do this but I

01:15:34,869 --> 01:15:40,059
don't know how to explain it but yeah

01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:42,340
well it's a challenge a lot of us are

01:15:40,059 --> 01:15:45,420
facing at the moment certainly yes you

01:15:42,340 --> 01:15:47,910
know uh next question we have a question

01:15:45,420 --> 01:15:52,770
a young man called Nathan day you may

01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:54,660
have heard of he he says how do you see

01:15:52,770 --> 01:15:56,640
the increased compute required for these

01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:59,820
dense vector operations impacting search

01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:01,410
and an interesting one is it a case that

01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:03,179
small company might be left behind

01:16:01,410 --> 01:16:04,650
because you'll need a certain scale or

01:16:03,179 --> 01:16:09,540
budget before you can actually revise

01:16:04,650 --> 01:16:11,820
the benefits yeah that's a I think

01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:13,770
that's really interesting I think that

01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:16,679
speaks to the you know the compute

01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:19,949
question it's really there's a pretty

01:16:16,679 --> 01:16:21,660
you know if I had maybe a good fun

01:16:19,949 --> 01:16:25,320
interview question that I thought about

01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:27,090
is telling someone to design a

01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:29,489
nearest-neighbor data structure from

01:16:27,090 --> 01:16:31,140
scratch if you want like one of those

01:16:29,489 --> 01:16:34,230
sort of like half a day Google

01:16:31,140 --> 01:16:35,880
whiteboard wake board interview

01:16:34,230 --> 01:16:38,820
questions because it's a really

01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:42,510
interesting question and what what that

01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:44,820
problem is is I can like if we might

01:16:42,510 --> 01:16:47,250
have a billion documents in our index

01:16:44,820 --> 01:16:50,580
each of those billion documents might be

01:16:47,250 --> 01:16:55,320
represented by a 300 dimensional vector

01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:59,489
or something now if I wanted to take a

01:16:55,320 --> 01:17:02,670
query 300 dimensional vector and sort of

01:16:59,489 --> 01:17:07,020
get the Billy the top ten documents out

01:17:02,670 --> 01:17:09,780
of those billion that are closest that's

01:17:07,020 --> 01:17:13,110
going to involve like if I just directly

01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:16,110
computed that that is a direct scan of a

01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:20,010
billion documents to do vector like a

01:17:16,110 --> 01:17:22,380
cosine similarity or something or

01:17:20,010 --> 01:17:25,370
Euclidean distance just to get like the

01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:28,440
the closest things and then return those

01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:32,429
now many of you may have seen many

01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:34,410
people may know that there are sort of

01:17:32,429 --> 01:17:36,480
re-ranking approaches where people will

01:17:34,410 --> 01:17:38,910
first they'll search with like the m25

01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:41,040
and they'll say okay well maybe I have

01:17:38,910 --> 01:17:43,050
some stuff in the ballpark I'm gonna do

01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:45,300
this I'm gonna scan the top thousand

01:17:43,050 --> 01:17:47,219
much like you might do with learning to

01:17:45,300 --> 01:17:48,540
rank model that's very common and I'm

01:17:47,219 --> 01:17:52,380
gonna bring up to the top of the best

01:17:48,540 --> 01:17:54,300
stuff in there now I sort of think we

01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:57,000
have that backwards I sort of feel like

01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:58,229
we might the best solution is probably

01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:01,590
first

01:17:58,229 --> 01:18:03,599
to do something in that vector-based

01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:06,269
world and pull back the candidates

01:18:03,599 --> 01:18:08,729
because like I said ever since I've been

01:18:06,269 --> 01:18:11,219
doing anything that's in this dense

01:18:08,729 --> 01:18:12,900
vector space you can cherry-pick really

01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:14,610
interesting good smart stuff but you can

01:18:12,900 --> 01:18:17,749
also find like complete failures and

01:18:14,610 --> 01:18:20,489
you're not entirely sure why sometimes

01:18:17,749 --> 01:18:23,090
but you you almost like get this good

01:18:20,489 --> 01:18:25,829
first set that's you know maybe

01:18:23,090 --> 01:18:27,749
maximizes the recall of good stuff the

01:18:25,829 --> 01:18:29,610
text based approach wouldn't get because

01:18:27,749 --> 01:18:32,880
text search is too strict and wants

01:18:29,610 --> 01:18:35,309
exact text message even even maybe even

01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:39,599
after we apply our knowledge graphs and

01:18:35,309 --> 01:18:41,519
our taxonomy and stuff and I sort of am

01:18:39,599 --> 01:18:43,349
wondering if we have these switched and

01:18:41,519 --> 01:18:45,360
so what a lot of people have been

01:18:43,349 --> 01:18:48,599
working on for a while and they're you

01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:53,309
know what Spotify has enjoy which is one

01:18:48,599 --> 01:18:55,920
approach there's a hierarchical herckel

01:18:53,309 --> 01:18:58,469
navigable what is it there's a lot of

01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:59,820
graph based models are you know the name

01:18:58,469 --> 01:19:02,729
of the algorithm transitive

01:18:59,820 --> 01:19:06,059
I think it's NSF doing that net medical

01:19:02,729 --> 01:19:08,400
hire in H naviga 18's as well I guess

01:19:06,059 --> 01:19:12,209
that has a very small world graph or so

01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:13,800
each MSW yeah oh yeah well I'll go look

01:19:12,209 --> 01:19:15,659
it up oh yeah yeah yeah yeah and

01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:17,489
basically the idea is you know much in

01:19:15,659 --> 01:19:19,139
the same way that for years we've had

01:19:17,489 --> 01:19:21,209
this inverted index data structure that

01:19:19,139 --> 01:19:24,059
could tokenize a document with the terms

01:19:21,209 --> 01:19:26,429
and basically take a term and point out

01:19:24,059 --> 01:19:29,099
every document that term occurs ax and

01:19:26,429 --> 01:19:32,219
we can do that blazing Li fast and we've

01:19:29,099 --> 01:19:35,429
seen is you know really you know burning

01:19:32,219 --> 01:19:39,630
you know cpos go Brewer whenever leucine

01:19:35,429 --> 01:19:42,030
runs right and and so we don't have

01:19:39,630 --> 01:19:43,829
we're still working on that with with

01:19:42,030 --> 01:19:46,409
sort of the dense vector approaches how

01:19:43,829 --> 01:19:48,539
do we take a 300 dimensional vector it

01:19:46,409 --> 01:19:50,789
sort of put in a data structure so that

01:19:48,539 --> 01:19:54,150
if I take a query 300 dimensional vector

01:19:50,789 --> 01:19:56,840
it will efficiently do kind of look up

01:19:54,150 --> 01:19:59,190
in that space and pull back ten

01:19:56,840 --> 01:20:02,880
documents or under documents whatever

01:19:59,190 --> 01:20:05,039
that are close and then maybe you know

01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:07,409
maybe maybe this isn't how the world

01:20:05,039 --> 01:20:10,499
works but then maybe we think about BM

01:20:07,409 --> 01:20:12,000
25 is like one aspect of a feature or a

01:20:10,499 --> 01:20:13,920
learning to rank model or maybe it's

01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,300
it's something else entirely or maybe

01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:18,750
that's infants some other deep learning

01:20:15,300 --> 01:20:19,860
model for Arirang 'king but I sort of

01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:22,710
think I sort of think search

01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:26,670
technologies are gonna are at this sea

01:20:22,710 --> 01:20:30,780
change in terms vector search that might

01:20:26,670 --> 01:20:34,140
enable that kind of future yeah

01:20:30,780 --> 01:20:36,450
and to piggyback on that just for for

01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:39,830
anyone listening who's not familiar with

01:20:36,450 --> 01:20:43,110
how this thins vector search works

01:20:39,830 --> 01:20:45,180
essentially you you have a field in the

01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:47,190
search engine a vector field that is

01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:49,470
representing some number of dimensions

01:20:47,190 --> 01:20:51,270
it's usually like as a float you maybe

01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:52,650
have like Doug mentioned 300 so I would

01:20:51,270 --> 01:20:56,130
have a field in the search engine with

01:20:52,650 --> 01:21:00,020
300 float values representing each of

01:20:56,130 --> 01:21:02,730
the 300 dimensions and then a query time

01:21:00,020 --> 01:21:05,730
you essentially can take you can take a

01:21:02,730 --> 01:21:08,580
query and map it into another 300

01:21:05,730 --> 01:21:09,930
dimensional vector and essentially what

01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:12,570
you're doing is you're doing a

01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:14,490
similarity between that vector a query

01:21:12,570 --> 01:21:16,980
time of 300 dimensions it represents the

01:21:14,490 --> 01:21:19,160
query and the vector on each document

01:21:16,980 --> 01:21:21,570
are potentially multiple per document

01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:23,340
representing the the meaning there and

01:21:21,570 --> 01:21:24,720
you're doing a similarity so cosine

01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:28,560
similarity is very common which are

01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:30,330
essentially calculating how how similar

01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:33,710
are the vectors that are in the document

01:21:30,330 --> 01:21:36,060
versus the query vector on that process

01:21:33,710 --> 01:21:37,920
like Doug mentioned is very expensive

01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:39,120
because if say you've got 10 million

01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:42,690
documents in your index

01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:44,490
there's no way to you know like with an

01:21:42,690 --> 01:21:47,100
inverted index readers literally looking

01:21:44,490 --> 01:21:49,530
up that postings list that has been

01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:52,650
preached ener ated there's no way with

01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:54,030
the the dense vector similarity to do

01:21:52,650 --> 01:21:57,240
that you have to do essentially a scan

01:21:54,030 --> 01:21:58,740
of all the documents and so the way this

01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:02,400
is usually solved in the search engine

01:21:58,740 --> 01:22:06,210
is by doing a nearest-neighbor

01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:08,790
filter before you do that similarity so

01:22:06,210 --> 01:22:10,290
essentially you know maybe it's clusters

01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:13,770
maybe it could be any number of ways

01:22:10,290 --> 01:22:15,960
that you you generate these these let's

01:22:13,770 --> 01:22:18,510
call them clusters these neighborhoods

01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:22,400
you filter down to the documents or the

01:22:18,510 --> 01:22:25,170
the closest and then you only do the

01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:25,889
similarity of those vectors on a small

01:22:25,170 --> 01:22:27,719
subset

01:22:25,889 --> 01:22:29,670
of your overall documents that's the

01:22:27,719 --> 01:22:30,780
rear ankang step Doug was mentioning so

01:22:29,670 --> 01:22:34,110
that's the typical approach that's

01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:37,380
followed h & SW hierarchical navigable

01:22:34,110 --> 01:22:39,780
small world that's what it is is one

01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:42,780
example that the intends to be near the

01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:48,119
cutting edge where you can actually

01:22:42,780 --> 01:22:50,400
encode those those neighborhoods into

01:22:48,119 --> 01:22:52,440
the index itself that something is being

01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:54,480
worked on in Lucien right now to make

01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:59,130
that filtering and then the rear inking

01:22:54,480 --> 01:23:01,170
just a much more seamless operation one

01:22:59,130 --> 01:23:03,000
of our one of our wonderful colleagues

01:23:01,170 --> 01:23:07,050
in the slack has just posted some

01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:09,780
references to that so thank you so the

01:23:07,050 --> 01:23:11,639
answer is yes it's going to be expensive

01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:12,659
if you're smart you can probably reduce

01:23:11,639 --> 01:23:15,960
the expense

01:23:12,659 --> 01:23:18,270
yeah and I'll just post quickly in the

01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:20,280
slack this the issue you see the nine

01:23:18,270 --> 01:23:22,409
thousand four and I d'être you have a

01:23:20,280 --> 01:23:23,159
corresponding solar issue to bring some

01:23:22,409 --> 01:23:26,040
yeah

01:23:23,159 --> 01:23:27,630
some scoring to some you know Spacek

01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:31,619
vector similarity of solar function

01:23:27,630 --> 01:23:33,270
queries to there's a lot of stuff being

01:23:31,619 --> 01:23:37,290
worked on the space there's a you know

01:23:33,270 --> 01:23:39,679
elastic open distro as there a n n

01:23:37,290 --> 01:23:43,980
algorithm approximate nearest neighbors

01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:47,699
elastic has there x-pac edition under

01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:48,780
basic license that is a more just doing

01:23:47,699 --> 01:23:51,600
a cosign some learning more the

01:23:48,780 --> 01:23:53,550
rear-ending side of things there are

01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:59,369
also things outside of the Lucene world

01:23:53,550 --> 01:24:00,989
like Vespa I know I think hands out is

01:23:59,369 --> 01:24:03,780
how you say his name is working on a

01:24:00,989 --> 01:24:06,869
search engine koujina ji na which is

01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:08,699
supposed to be neural first there this

01:24:06,869 --> 01:24:11,369
is one of the reasons I'm sort of

01:24:08,699 --> 01:24:13,710
fascinated we're at a pretty important

01:24:11,369 --> 01:24:16,920
inflection point search engines and I

01:24:13,710 --> 01:24:18,659
think we may have a broadening might get

01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:20,940
a flowering of new search engines which

01:24:18,659 --> 01:24:24,449
i think is is exciting and actually

01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:28,619
really promising yeah I was going to say

01:24:24,449 --> 01:24:31,409
two things one on I saw in the the slide

01:24:28,619 --> 01:24:35,130
channel I think a shim that was asking

01:24:31,409 --> 01:24:37,710
about the vector capabilities coming to

01:24:35,130 --> 01:24:39,510
Toulouse seen sort of what they mean so

01:24:37,710 --> 01:24:42,539
though I think those originally

01:24:39,510 --> 01:24:44,369
were came from a lot the elasticsearch

01:24:42,539 --> 01:24:46,739
implementation one thing I will say you

01:24:44,369 --> 01:24:51,829
know they don't start like a flame war

01:24:46,739 --> 01:24:55,920
here but the actually fundamentally I

01:24:51,829 --> 01:24:57,539
don't like the notion that a document

01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:01,349
like a field in a document just

01:24:57,539 --> 01:25:03,929
represents one vector of meaning need

01:25:01,349 --> 01:25:06,900
I'm working on a patch for solar I'm a

01:25:03,929 --> 01:25:08,159
just with work transitions and stuff

01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:11,099
haven't worked on it much in the last

01:25:08,159 --> 01:25:14,550
month or so but hopefully I'll get back

01:25:11,099 --> 01:25:16,289
to it at some point but the the approach

01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:18,989
I'm taking is think of it more as a

01:25:16,289 --> 01:25:20,820
multi value vector field so you know

01:25:18,989 --> 01:25:23,400
when I'm representing a document as a

01:25:20,820 --> 01:25:25,110
vector I'm essentially taking all of the

01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:27,929
content in that document and generating

01:25:25,110 --> 01:25:31,409
one vector of numbers that represents

01:25:27,929 --> 01:25:33,059
the document but the reality is instead

01:25:31,409 --> 01:25:34,739
of thinking of it as you know a document

01:25:33,059 --> 01:25:37,769
vector you can think of it I just like

01:25:34,739 --> 01:25:40,320
the generic term a thought vector and to

01:25:37,769 --> 01:25:41,969
me a thought vector could be a vector

01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:43,800
that represents the entire document it

01:25:41,969 --> 01:25:47,309
could be one that represents you know a

01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:49,409
paragraph or you know even a sentence or

01:25:47,309 --> 01:25:51,150
individual words so if you think that

01:25:49,409 --> 01:25:54,119
each word could be represented as a

01:25:51,150 --> 01:25:56,010
vector maybe phrase reach paragraph if

01:25:54,119 --> 01:25:58,949
you could have a multi value vector

01:25:56,010 --> 01:26:01,500
field then that would allow you to when

01:25:58,949 --> 01:26:03,630
you match from a query to documents not

01:26:01,500 --> 01:26:06,119
have to match the entire document and

01:26:03,630 --> 01:26:08,190
sort of its averaged meaning but to be

01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:09,539
able to actually match specific parts of

01:26:08,190 --> 01:26:13,500
documents that might matter more than

01:26:09,539 --> 01:26:15,539
others and so the the implementation I'm

01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:18,809
working on on the solar side right now

01:26:15,539 --> 01:26:21,510
is essentially allowing multiple value

01:26:18,809 --> 01:26:24,510
among multi valued vector field which I

01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:25,710
think gives a lot more opportunities in

01:26:24,510 --> 01:26:31,469
terms of the way that you can actually

01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:33,599
represent the content so I hopefully

01:26:31,469 --> 01:26:35,429
whatever is being built into we've seen

01:26:33,599 --> 01:26:37,380
I'm sure it will start with you know one

01:26:35,429 --> 01:26:40,380
vector per document like the elastic

01:26:37,380 --> 01:26:41,699
implementation but I hope that as things

01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:43,110
are being built out we can mentally

01:26:41,699 --> 01:26:44,760
think of a model where they could

01:26:43,110 --> 01:26:47,150
actually be multi valued fields and

01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:51,030
that's that's not super hard at the

01:26:47,150 --> 01:26:53,130
vector being represented and and scored

01:26:51,030 --> 01:26:55,170
for the the rear ankle piece as

01:26:53,130 --> 01:26:58,170
I've mentioned but when you start into

01:26:55,170 --> 01:27:00,770
things like embedding like like H and SW

01:26:58,170 --> 01:27:04,290
embedding in the core index structure

01:27:00,770 --> 01:27:06,270
the way a vector is represented I think

01:27:04,290 --> 01:27:08,370
it gets a lot harder if we don't think

01:27:06,270 --> 01:27:10,860
about upfront being able to support

01:27:08,370 --> 01:27:13,170
multiple values or multiple vectors I

01:27:10,860 --> 01:27:16,680
should say in the field and if we get

01:27:13,170 --> 01:27:19,170
sort of in a rigid model of thinking

01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:20,970
that there's one vector per field within

01:27:19,170 --> 01:27:23,190
a document I think that significantly

01:27:20,970 --> 01:27:25,230
limits some of the things that as an

01:27:23,190 --> 01:27:26,670
industry we need to be able to do in

01:27:25,230 --> 01:27:28,170
this space in the coming years so just

01:27:26,670 --> 01:27:29,910
throw that out there I'm not sure

01:27:28,170 --> 01:27:31,860
that'll start hopefully some other

01:27:29,910 --> 01:27:34,190
conversations but I think that's a

01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:36,480
really well that makes me think of

01:27:34,190 --> 01:27:38,760
almost makes me think of highlighting

01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:41,880
like we could have highlighting snippet

01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:44,490
ranking where we have a vector around a

01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:46,560
paragraph and yeah like this pair okay

01:27:44,490 --> 01:27:50,010
here's a score for maybe there's a score

01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:53,120
for a document but there's also a score

01:27:50,010 --> 01:27:56,730
for the paragraph of the document and

01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:58,110
I'm now I'm imagining I don't know if

01:27:56,730 --> 01:27:59,340
David smiley still working on

01:27:58,110 --> 01:28:02,570
highlighters but his head might be

01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:05,640
exploding thinking about how we gonna do

01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:07,140
vector based highlighting but we'll have

01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:08,760
to figure out how to rank snippets with

01:28:07,140 --> 01:28:10,740
vectors potentially there's a lot of

01:28:08,760 --> 01:28:14,490
really interesting applications and and

01:28:10,740 --> 01:28:16,230
we without having multiple values per

01:28:14,490 --> 01:28:17,790
field within the documents we cut off a

01:28:16,230 --> 01:28:21,510
lot of them so just want to throw that

01:28:17,790 --> 01:28:23,490
out there okay sounds very cool and I

01:28:21,510 --> 01:28:30,090
can see going off inventing stuff so

01:28:23,490 --> 01:28:31,680
yeah yes so I'm gonna just give you one

01:28:30,090 --> 01:28:33,450
more question then is that there's

01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:36,800
something we've got I know you want to

01:28:33,450 --> 01:28:40,020
talk about as well but Daniel Daniel

01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:42,300
asks when building personalized search

01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:44,760
how do we assure the implicit user

01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:46,260
context doesn't interfere too much or

01:28:44,760 --> 01:28:52,410
too little with the intent of the search

01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:54,410
that are specified in the query this

01:28:52,410 --> 01:28:58,770
goes back to the personalized search

01:28:54,410 --> 01:29:01,500
discussion from earlier probably Doug

01:28:58,770 --> 01:29:03,840
you want to take that one yeah the the

01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:05,820
how do you do it maybe that's that's

01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:07,620
more that's more interesting in a way

01:29:05,820 --> 01:29:09,390
because

01:29:07,620 --> 01:29:11,520
if you have a lot of implicit

01:29:09,390 --> 01:29:14,940
information about the query or about the

01:29:11,520 --> 01:29:18,030
the user or the query that that might

01:29:14,940 --> 01:29:19,890
actually I almost think about that

01:29:18,030 --> 01:29:24,600
instead of changing how we might

01:29:19,890 --> 01:29:26,550
interpret the query itself or how we

01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:28,830
might rank documents itself it changes

01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:32,880
how our understanding of their intention

01:29:28,830 --> 01:29:35,580
and you know if we just had the query

01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:38,700
and let's say the query is especially if

01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:41,190
the queries a broad query we might show

01:29:38,700 --> 01:29:43,200
a diverse set of search results and

01:29:41,190 --> 01:29:45,960
similar to what we talked about with

01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:50,010
driver before if all of a sudden its

01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:54,180
driver plus I know it's Doug Turnbull

01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:57,510
Doug is a software developer and you

01:29:54,180 --> 01:30:00,239
know once wrote C code blah blah then it

01:29:57,510 --> 01:30:02,610
might return Linux drivers or something

01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:04,830
I may even know that I once read a Linux

01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:09,510
driver book you know hopefully not ten

01:30:04,830 --> 01:30:11,880
years ago or something and I I sort of

01:30:09,510 --> 01:30:13,950
feel like it's it's in that it's in that

01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:16,140
realm of like tweaking our confidence

01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:19,500
and intentions where we make these

01:30:16,140 --> 01:30:22,830
decisions and there are cases actually

01:30:19,500 --> 01:30:26,760
where more context like that driver

01:30:22,830 --> 01:30:29,100
example might really be strongly

01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:30,660
influenced the M you know our

01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:34,140
interpretation of the NB or the query

01:30:30,660 --> 01:30:38,480
but then when we have very very specific

01:30:34,140 --> 01:30:44,700
queries where it's like Linux driver

01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:47,670
book O'Reilly it becomes really

01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:49,680
challenging to you sort of have to scope

01:30:47,670 --> 01:30:52,770
any interpretation of the intention to

01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:56,540
that to that query and there's a lot

01:30:52,770 --> 01:30:58,980
less ambiguity so in some ways

01:30:56,540 --> 01:31:00,480
personalization how much value is there

01:30:58,980 --> 01:31:02,670
in personalization in that place maybe

01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:05,670
there's a little bit but you definitely

01:31:02,670 --> 01:31:07,110
get in the spectrum of like I might do a

01:31:05,670 --> 01:31:09,540
little bit of tiebreaking with

01:31:07,110 --> 01:31:11,219
personalization but I have a really

01:31:09,540 --> 01:31:15,210
strong understanding of what this user

01:31:11,219 --> 01:31:18,150
means and it's almost fun it's it's

01:31:15,210 --> 01:31:20,430
probably not going to be even worth

01:31:18,150 --> 01:31:20,850
trying some oddball interpretation of

01:31:20,430 --> 01:31:24,630
what

01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:25,980
so yeah personalization is almost like

01:31:24,630 --> 01:31:27,900
you're baking a cake and adding some

01:31:25,980 --> 01:31:30,990
vanilla extract you know you want to be

01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:32,700
very light with you know were you yeah

01:31:30,990 --> 01:31:36,450
you add if you put too much you ruin the

01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:38,190
whole thing okay okay I wanted to just

01:31:36,450 --> 01:31:41,150
take a little diversion because it's a

01:31:38,190 --> 01:31:44,880
subject close to your house which is

01:31:41,150 --> 01:31:47,070
when we know that Google and other large

01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:49,260
tech companies now collect a huge amount

01:31:47,070 --> 01:31:50,280
of information about us and and to make

01:31:49,260 --> 01:31:52,500
you know it makes our lives more

01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:54,780
convenient and it has in personalization

01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:57,270
but there's been a backlash against this

01:31:54,780 --> 01:31:58,680
and not everyone's happy with the amount

01:31:57,270 --> 01:32:00,330
of information that's collected and

01:31:58,680 --> 01:32:04,140
these a lot of this information goes to

01:32:00,330 --> 01:32:06,420
power could go to power a high-powered

01:32:04,140 --> 01:32:08,280
search so how do we address this

01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:11,120
conflict now how do we build a a I

01:32:08,280 --> 01:32:13,490
powered search and still respect privacy

01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:16,920
yeah don't you mind if I take that one

01:32:13,490 --> 01:32:21,900
yeah go go for them so yeah it's it's a

01:32:16,920 --> 01:32:25,950
it's a hard challenge so you know on the

01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:27,270
one hand we've got content and you can

01:32:25,950 --> 01:32:29,460
search on content but we've talked a lot

01:32:27,270 --> 01:32:30,510
about user signals your user behaviors

01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:32,790
what they're doing what they're clicking

01:32:30,510 --> 01:32:34,410
on building models based upon that both

01:32:32,790 --> 01:32:38,910
in the aggregate and even to some degree

01:32:34,410 --> 01:32:42,060
on the personalization front and not

01:32:38,910 --> 01:32:44,580
doing that not not interpreting user

01:32:42,060 --> 01:32:46,860
behavior significantly handicaps your

01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:48,210
ability to provide you know an

01:32:46,860 --> 01:32:49,940
understanding of their intent and

01:32:48,210 --> 01:32:53,220
ultimately the best search results that

01:32:49,940 --> 01:32:55,200
being said most people don't like their

01:32:53,220 --> 01:32:58,110
information being collected they want it

01:32:55,200 --> 01:33:00,270
to be protected what have you so I've

01:32:58,110 --> 01:33:03,270
actually been an advisor for several

01:33:00,270 --> 01:33:05,760
years to a company called presearch it's

01:33:03,270 --> 01:33:09,570
sort of in the blockchain space it's a

01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:12,810
decentralized web search engine so the

01:33:09,570 --> 01:33:15,840
idea essentially is you've got Google

01:33:12,810 --> 01:33:19,020
and and I do and Bing and those search

01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:21,330
engines and DuckDuckGo what we're trying

01:33:19,020 --> 01:33:23,310
to do is build a decentralized search

01:33:21,330 --> 01:33:24,720
platform where people can run nodes and

01:33:23,310 --> 01:33:28,830
and there's no sort of there's no

01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:30,900
centralized control of the platform one

01:33:28,830 --> 01:33:34,320
of the key tenants and in my view is if

01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:34,620
a you know nobody's going to be able to

01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:36,780
go out

01:33:34,620 --> 01:33:38,580
hire enough smart search engineers and

01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:41,820
data scientists to ever be able to

01:33:38,580 --> 01:33:43,470
compete with Google but what you can do

01:33:41,820 --> 01:33:45,810
is you can try to open source and

01:33:43,470 --> 01:33:48,480
democratize the ability to build out

01:33:45,810 --> 01:33:50,220
search for the world and so I think of

01:33:48,480 --> 01:33:52,170
it as you know it's still early phases a

01:33:50,220 --> 01:33:54,540
lot of the technologies in early phases

01:33:52,170 --> 01:33:56,520
being built still but the idea is that

01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:58,850
eventually you have a platform where

01:33:56,520 --> 01:34:01,050
people can be rewarded and incentivized

01:33:58,850 --> 01:34:02,700
there's a whole token economy and what

01:34:01,050 --> 01:34:03,990
have you I won't get into but it can be

01:34:02,700 --> 01:34:06,000
rewarded and incentivize for their

01:34:03,990 --> 01:34:07,650
contributions to the platform so people

01:34:06,000 --> 01:34:09,810
who contribute code or new algorithms

01:34:07,650 --> 01:34:12,770
the platform essentially becomes a place

01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:16,500
to test how well those perform and

01:34:12,770 --> 01:34:18,180
ultimately to be able to you know have

01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:26,280
people be rewarded for the contributions

01:34:18,180 --> 01:34:31,560
so in you guys so here's ok I'll just

01:34:26,280 --> 01:34:32,910
keep talking I see so the so that's the

01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:34,980
idea so I've been working with them and

01:34:32,910 --> 01:34:38,910
one of the key tenants is this notion of

01:34:34,980 --> 01:34:42,270
privacy and so how do you how do you

01:34:38,910 --> 01:34:46,170
have a world where you know you can both

01:34:42,270 --> 01:34:48,810
collect user information and be able to

01:34:46,170 --> 01:34:50,310
personalize search results without that

01:34:48,810 --> 01:34:52,170
information being collected by it you

01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:53,610
know a single central authority and so

01:34:52,170 --> 01:34:55,350
one of the ways that that I'm thinking

01:34:53,610 --> 01:34:57,090
about it and we're you know still

01:34:55,350 --> 01:34:58,860
working through this is you know imagine

01:34:57,090 --> 01:35:01,050
if you went to let's just take Google

01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:03,990
imagine if you went to Google and your

01:35:01,050 --> 01:35:05,790
searches weren't logged by Google but

01:35:03,990 --> 01:35:07,800
they were actually kept in your cookies

01:35:05,790 --> 01:35:09,390
or you know somehow locally they were

01:35:07,800 --> 01:35:10,890
encrypted using your own keys and they

01:35:09,390 --> 01:35:13,470
could be used to help personalize the

01:35:10,890 --> 01:35:15,840
search but without you know any you know

01:35:13,470 --> 01:35:17,970
centralized party or other party you

01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:20,400
know having access to them so there's

01:35:17,970 --> 01:35:21,810
very much transient information and even

01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:23,460
your IP address and all those kinds of

01:35:21,810 --> 01:35:26,100
things are restricted so some of those

01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:28,590
things were actually trying to solve on

01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:30,240
pre search and I'm you know gonna be

01:35:28,590 --> 01:35:31,890
able to spend a lot more time working

01:35:30,240 --> 01:35:34,620
with them you know in the very near

01:35:31,890 --> 01:35:35,760
future but yeah it's a really hard

01:35:34,620 --> 01:35:37,440
problem because I you know some people

01:35:35,760 --> 01:35:40,140
like DuckDuckGo you know they take the

01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:42,030
perspective of hey we're not going to

01:35:40,140 --> 01:35:45,150
log your searches and that's just how we

01:35:42,030 --> 01:35:47,250
work and how we operate and great that's

01:35:45,150 --> 01:35:48,479
great for privacy but you do handicap

01:35:47,250 --> 01:35:51,570
yourselves in terms of your

01:35:48,479 --> 01:35:53,699
to improve and so I I really am very

01:35:51,570 --> 01:35:56,099
much thinking along the lines of how do

01:35:53,699 --> 01:35:58,289
we keep the benefits of personalization

01:35:56,099 --> 01:36:01,110
while removing the risks and downside

01:35:58,289 --> 01:36:03,030
it's of some company or even government

01:36:01,110 --> 01:36:04,469
having access to those things on an

01:36:03,030 --> 01:36:07,110
ongoing basis so that I do really

01:36:04,469 --> 01:36:08,760
control my data and can do whatever I

01:36:07,110 --> 01:36:13,619
want with it and including not

01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:15,840
collecting it at all yeah I almost I

01:36:13,619 --> 01:36:17,729
almost wonder about you know Trey I

01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:19,289
think you put a lot more thought into

01:36:17,729 --> 01:36:20,969
this I have but I almost wonder if in

01:36:19,289 --> 01:36:25,409
the spirit of like end-to-end encryption

01:36:20,969 --> 01:36:30,630
is there a way that I truly can own my

01:36:25,409 --> 01:36:31,979
data where I'm not an encryption person

01:36:30,630 --> 01:36:34,499
we need to get an encryption person on

01:36:31,979 --> 01:36:36,059
here but where my where the search

01:36:34,499 --> 01:36:38,820
training data going to build whatever

01:36:36,059 --> 01:36:42,179
machine learning model can somehow be

01:36:38,820 --> 01:36:44,489
turned off by me at you know by clicking

01:36:42,179 --> 01:36:46,590
a button and I can have some full

01:36:44,489 --> 01:36:49,739
confidence and trust that that has

01:36:46,590 --> 01:36:51,300
actually happened because I think as

01:36:49,739 --> 01:36:54,690
organizations we're in a tricky position

01:36:51,300 --> 01:36:57,780
because we do need a lot of implicit

01:36:54,690 --> 01:37:01,349
information from our users and frankly

01:36:57,780 --> 01:37:04,739
as much as we want to be privacy

01:37:01,349 --> 01:37:09,170
obsessed I think almost everyone who's

01:37:04,739 --> 01:37:11,550
not you know extremists about this is

01:37:09,170 --> 01:37:15,389
wants the convenience of things being

01:37:11,550 --> 01:37:18,630
personalized for them so it's you know

01:37:15,389 --> 01:37:20,489
if I go on to some if I go to Netflix I

01:37:18,630 --> 01:37:22,110
know what it's doing I know what it's

01:37:20,489 --> 01:37:25,229
what I think I know what it's doing

01:37:22,110 --> 01:37:28,820
which is part of the problem what I

01:37:25,229 --> 01:37:35,789
think when I think there is especially

01:37:28,820 --> 01:37:37,380
where it gets really tricky is I wonder

01:37:35,789 --> 01:37:39,840
to what extent we have an ethical

01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:42,989
obligation even when users don't ask for

01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:46,800
it and even when users are can are sort

01:37:42,989 --> 01:37:49,709
of convenience tie us not asking them to

01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:50,880
put front and center like maybe I mean

01:37:49,709 --> 01:37:52,610
I'm not I don't necessarily want to call

01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:55,969
out Google that they are like the

01:37:52,610 --> 01:37:58,439
billion dollar gorilla in the room

01:37:55,969 --> 01:38:00,979
I'm almost imagining I wish there was a

01:37:58,439 --> 01:38:02,160
checkbox under Google that was like

01:38:00,979 --> 01:38:03,570
forget

01:38:02,160 --> 01:38:07,320
you know I mean I know I can go to a

01:38:03,570 --> 01:38:09,120
kognito mo to get this but eh I know and

01:38:07,320 --> 01:38:11,700
I know I can dig into the settings and

01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:13,230
probably do this and maybe trust that

01:38:11,700 --> 01:38:16,770
Google is gonna do that do you like do

01:38:13,230 --> 01:38:19,230
the right thing but literally a show me

01:38:16,770 --> 01:38:21,660
everything you know about me that is

01:38:19,230 --> 01:38:25,920
going into the search delete everything

01:38:21,660 --> 01:38:27,480
you know about me forever or you know I

01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:29,430
could just turn it on and off and be

01:38:27,480 --> 01:38:31,770
able to sort of have some fine control

01:38:29,430 --> 01:38:34,080
over that and I know that sounds

01:38:31,770 --> 01:38:35,760
annoying and I know that like I'm not a

01:38:34,080 --> 01:38:37,320
UI designer and I shouldn't come here

01:38:35,760 --> 01:38:39,540
search UI so it was probably a better

01:38:37,320 --> 01:38:41,460
way to do this but I sort of wonder if

01:38:39,540 --> 01:38:44,160
we have an ethical obligation as search

01:38:41,460 --> 01:38:48,690
teams to be thinking about that level of

01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:50,070
transparency and I feel like I'm saying

01:38:48,690 --> 01:38:52,230
this in everyone you know you might your

01:38:50,070 --> 01:38:54,300
head you might think I'm crazy but I

01:38:52,230 --> 01:38:56,850
sort of feel like as this these issues

01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:58,950
are evolving I think a couple years from

01:38:56,850 --> 01:39:00,450
now this is gonna be even more front and

01:38:58,950 --> 01:39:05,370
center and people are going to be even

01:39:00,450 --> 01:39:06,930
more aware of all the things like I just

01:39:05,370 --> 01:39:08,580
think about all the things all the

01:39:06,930 --> 01:39:11,870
things that Google might know about me

01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:14,910
whether it's Google Docs I've written or

01:39:11,870 --> 01:39:17,910
email or all the Google Analytics every

01:39:14,910 --> 01:39:20,130
site I've owned or all that information

01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:23,880
like how can I know and where is it

01:39:20,130 --> 01:39:27,180
going and as much as I want us to have

01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:29,040
this you know uninterpretable AiAi

01:39:27,180 --> 01:39:30,060
powered search future I sort of think it

01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:31,950
needs to be balanced this

01:39:30,060 --> 01:39:33,510
interpretability question must need to

01:39:31,950 --> 01:39:34,830
be balanced by like that okay what is

01:39:33,510 --> 01:39:37,470
going into the search and how can I

01:39:34,830 --> 01:39:39,270
control that yeah completely agreed I

01:39:37,470 --> 01:39:41,550
mean it just this past week Google was

01:39:39,270 --> 01:39:43,020
all in the news for tracking users in

01:39:41,550 --> 01:39:44,910
incognito mode I don't know all the

01:39:43,020 --> 01:39:46,410
details so I saw that that's right

01:39:44,910 --> 01:39:48,840
probably blown out of proportion I

01:39:46,410 --> 01:39:51,570
haven't really dug into it but I mean

01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:52,770
even when you go into incognito mode you

01:39:51,570 --> 01:39:54,360
know when you go to Google they still

01:39:52,770 --> 01:39:56,010
collect your IP address they still

01:39:54,360 --> 01:39:57,510
collect your search terms the only thing

01:39:56,010 --> 01:40:00,000
you're doing is not persisting your

01:39:57,510 --> 01:40:02,130
cookies and so you know it's essentially

01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:04,020
up to us and this isn't thinking at

01:40:02,130 --> 01:40:06,810
Google but you know anybody any search

01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:09,060
engine this essentially you know you're

01:40:06,810 --> 01:40:10,260
giving them all the information about

01:40:09,060 --> 01:40:13,140
yourself and your queries and you're

01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:15,360
trusting them to you know keep it in

01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:16,139
confidence and you know not do anything

01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:17,699
malicious with

01:40:16,139 --> 01:40:20,280
but the reality is you don't have any

01:40:17,699 --> 01:40:23,400
control over that and so I you know I do

01:40:20,280 --> 01:40:25,619
think there's there some ethical

01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:29,100
obligation on our part as people working

01:40:25,619 --> 01:40:31,409
on search to not take advantage of our

01:40:29,100 --> 01:40:33,179
customers and our end users and to

01:40:31,409 --> 01:40:37,639
respect privacy and all those kinds of

01:40:33,179 --> 01:40:40,860
things so but the reality is today it's

01:40:37,639 --> 01:40:42,570
the user information and signals are

01:40:40,860 --> 01:40:44,969
very important to delivering a good

01:40:42,570 --> 01:40:51,980
search experience and it is way too hard

01:40:44,969 --> 01:40:54,030
to collect them in a way that is easy

01:40:51,980 --> 01:40:55,590
and a hundred percent and not going to

01:40:54,030 --> 01:40:58,369
be abused it's just way too hard to do

01:40:55,590 --> 01:41:03,719
that and so most companies don't have

01:40:58,369 --> 01:41:06,409
commercial reasons to add those

01:41:03,719 --> 01:41:08,909
protections in and less mandated by law

01:41:06,409 --> 01:41:10,110
but I that doesn't mean we shouldn't be

01:41:08,909 --> 01:41:12,179
thinking about it and trying to solve

01:41:10,110 --> 01:41:13,650
the problem regardless of how hard it is

01:41:12,179 --> 01:41:15,119
you know maybe we can come up with some

01:41:13,650 --> 01:41:18,020
solutions that make it easier for

01:41:15,119 --> 01:41:20,580
everybody it's related to another

01:41:18,020 --> 01:41:24,840
ethical problem I think that a I powered

01:41:20,580 --> 01:41:26,520
search or search in general basis and I

01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:30,330
think grant talked about this a lot in

01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:32,369
the keynote earlier today where we can

01:41:30,330 --> 01:41:36,300
so easily get into our own echo chambers

01:41:32,369 --> 01:41:38,250
and this is if we think about

01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:41,040
information retrieval broad more broadly

01:41:38,250 --> 01:41:44,070
than search and we think about things

01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:47,010
like social media news feeds mm-hmm and

01:41:44,070 --> 01:41:48,949
we think about things like you know even

01:41:47,010 --> 01:41:53,040
search results I'm sure are this way

01:41:48,949 --> 01:41:55,139
where I am so often I I was you know

01:41:53,040 --> 01:41:58,830
I've been waking up I've been having

01:41:55,139 --> 01:42:01,920
trouble sleeping in recently and instead

01:41:58,830 --> 01:42:05,429
of googling the the objective what

01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:07,949
impact does summer have on sleep or

01:42:05,429 --> 01:42:10,830
something like that it was I wanted to

01:42:07,949 --> 01:42:13,350
confirm my hypothesis I wanted someone

01:42:10,830 --> 01:42:15,270
to write that early you know and I'm you

01:42:13,350 --> 01:42:16,770
know this is probably true but early

01:42:15,270 --> 01:42:18,480
morning light is definitely the cause of

01:42:16,770 --> 01:42:20,310
why I was having sleep problems or

01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:21,570
something like that and it's a lot of

01:42:20,310 --> 01:42:24,750
people's searches are really about

01:42:21,570 --> 01:42:26,389
confirming hypotheses mm-hmm and I think

01:42:24,750 --> 01:42:29,640
the sort of the personalization of

01:42:26,389 --> 01:42:31,500
search and all that sort of it really

01:42:29,640 --> 01:42:34,230
forces that echo-chamber that that were

01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:36,240
we're all in and especially when things

01:42:34,230 --> 01:42:38,910
to I think grant said this really well

01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:41,340
when things are very a session and

01:42:38,910 --> 01:42:43,880
conversion based we lose that broader

01:42:41,340 --> 01:42:48,390
perspective of the information need of

01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:51,450
of you know Doug just needs to be a

01:42:48,390 --> 01:42:54,360
well-informed sleeper or something like

01:42:51,450 --> 01:42:55,800
that or Doug just needs a call as dr.

01:42:54,360 --> 01:42:59,340
mine my doctor's phone number should

01:42:55,800 --> 01:43:02,250
just pop up or something like that so

01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:04,560
said our industry sort of faces these

01:43:02,250 --> 01:43:06,030
and I do feel that if we're in this

01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:08,400
industry world benefiting financially

01:43:06,030 --> 01:43:10,710
from having these skills I think we need

01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:15,210
to think about an advocate through the

01:43:10,710 --> 01:43:17,970
piece needs to our employers agree

01:43:15,210 --> 01:43:19,410
yeah really important and also if you

01:43:17,970 --> 01:43:35,550
can ask Google to delete delete that

01:43:19,410 --> 01:43:37,980
query of your yeah what we've got we've

01:43:35,550 --> 01:43:40,970
got another question here from Daniel

01:43:37,980 --> 01:43:44,670
we're running out of time for this one

01:43:40,970 --> 01:43:46,620
Daniel says searches a lot about

01:43:44,670 --> 01:43:49,080
educating the user with all this magic

01:43:46,620 --> 01:43:57,320
happening or factors how much how might

01:43:49,080 --> 01:44:01,140
serve still fulfill this promise yeah so

01:43:57,320 --> 01:44:03,360
don't mentioned earlier let's take an

01:44:01,140 --> 01:44:06,630
e-commerce example like when somebody

01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:08,220
comes Doug mentioned the walking into a

01:44:06,630 --> 01:44:09,720
department store and asking for a you

01:44:08,220 --> 01:44:11,910
know a sports jacket or what-have-you

01:44:09,720 --> 01:44:14,220
earlier um there's lots of different

01:44:11,910 --> 01:44:15,470
kinds of intents that people have when

01:44:14,220 --> 01:44:17,580
they come to run searches right so

01:44:15,470 --> 01:44:20,520
sometimes there's more of a browse

01:44:17,580 --> 01:44:22,020
intent where somebody's just looking to

01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:23,810
see what you have available but not

01:44:22,020 --> 01:44:27,600
looking for anything in particular

01:44:23,810 --> 01:44:30,240
sometimes somebody might so so in that

01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:32,370
case they might type in sports jacket in

01:44:30,240 --> 01:44:35,190
other cases they might type in like a

01:44:32,370 --> 01:44:37,370
UPC or your products you or even like

01:44:35,190 --> 01:44:40,200
the specific name or ID of the product

01:44:37,370 --> 01:44:43,590
that's that's more of an intent for them

01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:45,450
to buy meaning they they either buy or

01:44:43,590 --> 01:44:47,400
they know specifically what they're

01:44:45,450 --> 01:44:50,040
looking for they don't want you to be

01:44:47,400 --> 01:44:51,540
smart and do anything you know they

01:44:50,040 --> 01:44:54,030
don't need neural search they really

01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:55,380
need you to match an ID or a name and

01:44:54,030 --> 01:44:58,860
bring them back the one thing they're

01:44:55,380 --> 01:45:00,780
looking for you know in that case

01:44:58,860 --> 01:45:01,920
they're probably looking to purchase or

01:45:00,780 --> 01:45:03,780
they're you know maybe checking the

01:45:01,920 --> 01:45:06,540
price or something but it's a very clear

01:45:03,780 --> 01:45:08,840
intent of I don't need to educate them

01:45:06,540 --> 01:45:11,640
right now on other related products

01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:12,900
necessarily what I need to do is show

01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:17,340
them this product and help them make a

01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:19,380
decision about this product and in the

01:45:17,340 --> 01:45:21,030
former case there's a huge incentive to

01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:24,420
need to just generally educate them

01:45:21,030 --> 01:45:26,100
about you know the topic in the latter

01:45:24,420 --> 01:45:28,080
case it's more about trying to close the

01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:31,050
sale and there's everything in between

01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:34,290
you know the user might type in support

01:45:31,050 --> 01:45:36,450
or you know like in a they might be

01:45:34,290 --> 01:45:38,970
looking for like if it's in enterprise

01:45:36,450 --> 01:45:41,360
search use case they might type in PTO

01:45:38,970 --> 01:45:44,100
policy or something like that and so

01:45:41,360 --> 01:45:45,660
sometimes and I would even go one step

01:45:44,100 --> 01:45:47,610
further you know say it's a telecom

01:45:45,660 --> 01:45:50,130
company like your mobile phone company

01:45:47,610 --> 01:45:51,360
and somebody types in pay bill in that

01:45:50,130 --> 01:45:52,740
case they're not looking for information

01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:54,540
at all they're looking to actually take

01:45:52,740 --> 01:45:55,920
an action and so that's where things

01:45:54,540 --> 01:46:00,270
like chatbots start to get integrated

01:45:55,920 --> 01:46:03,390
and so I think that the the notion of a

01:46:00,270 --> 01:46:05,580
search engine as something that just

01:46:03,390 --> 01:46:08,820
like brings me back a list of 10 blue

01:46:05,580 --> 01:46:12,210
links is very dated at this point I I

01:46:08,820 --> 01:46:13,800
see the idea of search giving you access

01:46:12,210 --> 01:46:15,180
to information sometimes you want

01:46:13,800 --> 01:46:17,940
documents sometimes you want to bring

01:46:15,180 --> 01:46:20,010
back a specific answer maybe a snippet

01:46:17,940 --> 01:46:22,740
pulled out of a document sometimes you

01:46:20,010 --> 01:46:24,360
want to redirect somebody to a chatbot

01:46:22,740 --> 01:46:28,170
or to a customer support and so I think

01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:31,050
search is really becoming the the center

01:46:28,170 --> 01:46:33,900
the central point or focus of how we

01:46:31,050 --> 01:46:36,030
interact with digital information and I

01:46:33,900 --> 01:46:37,920
personally I see things like search

01:46:36,030 --> 01:46:42,500
engines recommendation engines chat BOTS

01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:44,700
like I see this whole spectrum actually

01:46:42,500 --> 01:46:46,560
converging over the coming years as

01:46:44,700 --> 01:46:49,620
opposed to those things being separate

01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:51,360
systems I see hopefully from an end user

01:46:49,620 --> 01:46:53,280
standpoint it's a seamless experience

01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:54,990
and not naughty they're not even

01:46:53,280 --> 01:46:57,120
thinking of it as search they're just

01:46:54,990 --> 01:46:59,220
thinking of it as let me find

01:46:57,120 --> 01:47:02,970
didn't do the things I need to do and so

01:46:59,220 --> 01:47:04,440
you know go vector searches is a key

01:47:02,970 --> 01:47:06,870
building block like all the other things

01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:08,580
but I think that well at the end of the

01:47:06,870 --> 01:47:11,070
day information retrieval is about

01:47:08,580 --> 01:47:12,870
understanding the users intent

01:47:11,070 --> 01:47:14,730
delivering on their information need and

01:47:12,870 --> 01:47:16,650
information needs I think over the last

01:47:14,730 --> 01:47:18,210
few years have just evolved to be much

01:47:16,650 --> 01:47:23,610
more than ten blue links they've evolved

01:47:18,210 --> 01:47:25,080
to be helped me learn find and act upon

01:47:23,610 --> 01:47:27,180
whatever it is I'm trying to do right

01:47:25,080 --> 01:47:29,430
now and so that's that's kind of where

01:47:27,180 --> 01:47:31,020
my thoughts are Doug yeah it's really

01:47:29,430 --> 01:47:34,080
hard to like answer that question

01:47:31,020 --> 01:47:37,440
without a specific application in mind

01:47:34,080 --> 01:47:41,070
like if you were a chatbot how you would

01:47:37,440 --> 01:47:43,890
say that you understood what the user

01:47:41,070 --> 01:47:46,590
needed and built trust with them you

01:47:43,890 --> 01:47:50,160
might ask them oh is this what you mean

01:47:46,590 --> 01:47:51,630
do you want to cancel your airplane

01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:55,860
reservation something all of us may have

01:47:51,630 --> 01:47:58,670
been through recently and or if you're a

01:47:55,860 --> 01:48:03,390
question answering system literally like

01:47:58,670 --> 01:48:04,770
Google Google will do this if it's this

01:48:03,390 --> 01:48:08,370
is really interesting and I think this

01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:09,870
is like a interesting baby step to

01:48:08,370 --> 01:48:12,120
question answering where you see they'll

01:48:09,870 --> 01:48:14,640
like quick answers you get question

01:48:12,120 --> 01:48:16,860
answering you get quick answers and if

01:48:14,640 --> 01:48:18,000
you type a question and you like scan

01:48:16,860 --> 01:48:19,500
through the quick answers like oh I

01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:20,160
recognize this question this is really

01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:22,980
what I mean

01:48:20,160 --> 01:48:26,160
that's built a link between your query

01:48:22,980 --> 01:48:27,360
and that and so in the future when

01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:28,740
enough people search for that and they

01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:32,310
sort of clarify that's what they mean

01:48:28,740 --> 01:48:35,730
then we a question answering and we will

01:48:32,310 --> 01:48:38,100
know with some confidence that oh this

01:48:35,730 --> 01:48:40,910
is actually the answer to the question

01:48:38,100 --> 01:48:43,410
we've been able to measure that and

01:48:40,910 --> 01:48:45,990
every - every one of these sort of UI

01:48:43,410 --> 01:48:48,330
footprints is different important if

01:48:45,990 --> 01:48:50,190
you're an e-commerce often it's very

01:48:48,330 --> 01:48:52,470
much about comparing contrasting and

01:48:50,190 --> 01:48:54,150
what are the factors that matter when

01:48:52,470 --> 01:48:56,430
you search for television versus when

01:48:54,150 --> 01:48:59,160
you search for shoes and can you show

01:48:56,430 --> 01:49:00,330
that in the UI and can you know maybe

01:48:59,160 --> 01:49:01,860
there's a little bit of personalization

01:49:00,330 --> 01:49:03,510
to know this user is going to care a

01:49:01,860 --> 01:49:07,200
little bit more about this factor so I'm

01:49:03,510 --> 01:49:09,480
going to show that in the UI I almost

01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:10,650
think it's independent of the underlying

01:49:09,480 --> 01:49:13,020
solution

01:49:10,650 --> 01:49:16,290
to some extent at the end of the day

01:49:13,020 --> 01:49:17,760
it's sort of we it's it's the

01:49:16,290 --> 01:49:19,830
intersection of sort of the product

01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:23,219
expertise the engineering data science

01:49:19,830 --> 01:49:25,890
and the and that in the UX of like user

01:49:23,219 --> 01:49:29,310
asks a question and can we reflect back

01:49:25,890 --> 01:49:30,480
to them the real understanding of what

01:49:29,310 --> 01:49:35,179
they need and sort of the information

01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:37,980
they need to take a further action okay

01:49:35,179 --> 01:49:41,610
well I'm going to bring us to a close

01:49:37,980 --> 01:49:43,560
there firstly I'd like to thank to the

01:49:41,610 --> 01:49:45,780

Turnbull for answering introduced

01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:54,060
questions that apparently I hear there's

01:49:52,409 --> 01:49:58,530
a rumor of some kind of book so when

01:49:54,060 --> 01:50:01,500
that does appear we're writing the AI

01:49:58,530 --> 01:50:04,199
that it will rate the book yes happy a

01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:05,940
quick read wouldn't I'd also like to

hope we got to I think we got to almost

01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:12,600
all of them which is great we did have a

01:50:10,260 --> 01:50:14,310
list of pre-prepared questions just in

01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:15,449
case we didn't get enough on the channel

01:50:14,310 --> 01:50:17,429
but we didn't really need to dip into

01:50:15,449 --> 01:50:19,920
that much at all so thank you very much

01:50:17,429 --> 01:50:22,409

list but I think we got to most of them

01:50:29,810 --> 01:50:33,900
just a couple of extra other bits of

01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:35,699
housekeeping we're still looking for

01:50:33,900 --> 01:50:37,140
