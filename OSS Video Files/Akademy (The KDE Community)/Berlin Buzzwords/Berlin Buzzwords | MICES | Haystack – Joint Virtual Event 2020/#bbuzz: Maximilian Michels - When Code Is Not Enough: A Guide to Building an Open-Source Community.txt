The community is the heart of every open-source project. Without a proper functioning community, the project is bound to have a heart attack, which could be the end: Think of unsatisfied users, project forks, maintainer burnouts, or very annoying arguments.

Building a community can be a daunting task but it doesn't have to be. All it takes is a critical mass of people who have a long-term interest in growing the community. Be it companies or individuals.

As it turns out, this group can systematically foster the community by building a framework for community interaction: writing down guidelines, helping users, onboarding new contributors, etc. The next step is to break out of the daily business through organizing conferences, meetups, or regular face-to-face meetings. Ultimately, the community is held together by relationships which are best strengthened via face time.

In the past years, I've seen two different communities grow: Apache Flink and Apache Beam. Both have found a way to grow their community. I'd like to present and analyze the paths they chose to build the strong communities they have today.

	00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:14,980
so hello everyone and welcome my name is

00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:17,140
Max and thanks for tuning in to the

00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:20,710
session and yeah thank you for the nice

00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:23,529
introduction let me start off by saying

00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:26,490
this is a bit of a different talk most

00:00:23,529 --> 00:00:29,109
talks here at buzzwords focus on

00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:32,800
building or using open source

00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:37,710
technologies but I want to take a step

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:40,150
back today and look beyond the code so

00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,790
what makes an open source project open

00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:45,670
source while strictly speaking it's the

00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:48,190
freely available code but there's more

00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:50,729
to open source than its code and in

00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:52,930
order for a project to be successful a

00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:55,720
successful open source project it needs

00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:58,089
to develop a community because the

00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:01,479
community is like the backbone of the

00:00:58,089 --> 00:01:04,390
project it establishes the framework for

00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:06,420
the collaboration for innovation for

00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:10,780
growth and ultimately also

00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,789
sustainability so for example in a

00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,310
healthy and diverse community the

00:01:12,789 --> 00:01:17,680
constant flow of ideas is likely to

00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:20,710
produce a better outcome than a project

00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:26,469
that is proprietary proprietary or one

00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:29,049
which has a disorganized community but

00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:31,780
not all communities are the same so

00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:34,899
let's take a look today what makes a

00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:37,840
good community let's take a look at some

00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:41,560
some of the structure of a community how

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:44,200
to build it and also let's spend a

00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:48,600
little bit of time to see what are the

00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:54,960
common pitfalls and some examples of

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:59,109
successfully build communities all right

00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:04,179
but first of all let's talk about open

00:01:59,109 --> 00:02:05,770
source what is open source anyway it is

00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:07,920
pretty much taken for granted these days

00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:12,760
to have you know a bunch of open source

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:15,520
code available free to use but in early

00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:18,250
times the soft development starting in

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:20,200
let's say the 50s that was about the

00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,230
time when people started writing really

00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,300
code

00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:25,879
there used to be normal to distribute

00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:29,030
the source code alongside with the

00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:31,730
binary because often times there was no

00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:33,590
standard or there was no standard

00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,360
computer architecture at the time so

00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:38,180
people had to adjust the source code in

00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,769
order for the program to run the

00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,049
software to run on their computer or a

00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:45,680
mainframe or whatever it was called at a

00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:47,420
time and most people who develop

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,709
software of course were like researchers

00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:52,760
at universities or it companies and

00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:55,040
software was actually bundled with

00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,079
hardware a lot of times so software

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,319
would would also be supported by a

00:02:57,079 --> 00:03:03,890
one-time payment for the hardware again

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:06,260
that changed later because as we see

00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:08,930
today because in the 60s software became

00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:10,790
increasingly more complex we had like a

00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:13,010
lot of programming language operating

00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:15,829
systems and people really started using

00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:19,849
software and they started to charge

00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:22,760
money and in 74 software became

00:03:19,849 --> 00:03:24,049
copyrightable in the United States but

00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,150
actually I didn't have a big impact

00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:27,680
because many companies already had

00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:33,230
stopped to distribute source code to

00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:35,810
increase their revenue in 1983 Richard

00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:38,329
Stallman created the GNU project because

00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:40,549
well he was frustrated with non portable

00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:43,310
proprietary computer system so you

00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:45,639
wanted something portable and yeah he

00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:51,079
created this free software foundation in

00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:52,760
85 1985 um so it is funny that the Free

00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:54,470
Software Foundation actually did doesn't

00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,030
like the term open source they wanted a

00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:58,419
different term they wanted they still

00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:01,130
use the term free software instead

00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:04,040
because they say open source is a

00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:05,650
development methodology free software is

00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:10,069
a social movement

00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:11,780
well I mean it's debatable and there's

00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:14,379
definitely some source of truth in it

00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:18,530
but the internet and increasing user

00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:23,720
softly led to a lot of commercial use

00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:28,250
and basically open source one as a

00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:30,680
concept but yeah as more and more

00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:34,450
companies adopted it they were also

00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:40,090
great communities founded and in nine

00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:42,060
18 1998 sorry there was the the open

00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:47,170
source initiative was founded and we had

00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:49,630
the first very popular source project

00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:51,820
besides Linux the Netscape Browser and

00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:53,560
in 99 also the Apache Software

00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:57,970
Foundation was founded so there's

00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:59,680
clearly evidence of success in open

00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:02,560
source and a lot of successful

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,240
communities and other foundations being

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,200
founded like the Linux and and Python

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:11,770
Software Foundation before we dive into

00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:14,680
communities in more detail let's let me

00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:16,180
talk a few words about myself again I'm

00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:17,950
max I'm a software engineer in

00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,770
consultants foreign sauce technologies

00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:26,440
and I started using open source software

00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:29,860
around 20 years ago I think I built my

00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:32,470
own network router with Linux and early

00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:36,150
2000 I became like a Firefox and

00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:38,920
Thunderbird user I'm quite early and

00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:42,910
I've used Linux also from my desktop for

00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:44,110
more than 10 years if you if I wear the

00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:48,970
conference today you would see I'm using

00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:52,660
MacBook but still I used Linux and open

00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:54,250
source of course every day so it was

00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:57,610
actually a little bit later in my

00:05:54,250 --> 00:06:00,670
studies that I understood to look better

00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:02,530
what open sauce was because I was really

00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:04,060
interested in distributed systems at the

00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:07,900
time and I was working at a Research

00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:11,470
Institute and we had a really fun

00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:14,770
database distribute database and it was

00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:16,900
also a source and so at first time I was

00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:19,300
really like working in more intensively

00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,750
and on an open source project instead of

00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:26,860
just using open source and reporting box

00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:28,900
but I found that there were no really

00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,490
there was no community I mean a sense I

00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,350
was a community because there bunch of a

00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:35,440
bunch of people at the Institute were

00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:37,660
working on the software but we never

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,750
really received any patches from the

00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:43,150
outside we had actually some people who

00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:44,950
tried it out and we're not working at

00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:47,889
university and they were using the issue

00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:49,539
tracker but we

00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:50,979
actually ignored the issues because they

00:06:49,539 --> 00:06:54,909
were kind of getting in our way of

00:06:50,979 --> 00:06:57,460
getting our work done and I think this

00:06:54,909 --> 00:07:00,669
is definitely a problem that people have

00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:04,240
you know also in big project but I also

00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:05,740
started wondering how does open source

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,629
work like how can you how can you

00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:10,029
actually build a community so after

00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:12,340
graduating I had the opportunity to join

00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:14,830
a company called data artisans which the

00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:18,389
company here in building star called Bev

00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:21,159
Erika but anyways this company built a

00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:23,740
community for an open-source project

00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:27,189
called Apache flank and it actually

00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:29,740
started with like close to 0 users at

00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:32,860
least outside of the academic context

00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:35,860
and yeah I just found out at the time

00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:38,289
that I really loved distributed systems

00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:41,319
coding problem-solving but I also cared

00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:43,900
about open source and yeah and reason is

00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:46,240
simple for that because the community is

00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:48,939
really the heart of any open source

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,699
project and without the heart is no know

00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:53,710
life in an open source project so I'm a

00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:56,680
bit bit biased towards Apache which

00:07:53,710 --> 00:08:02,099
which you probably will notice but I'll

00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:07,810
also take a look at other forms of

00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:10,300
ownership in an open source project so

00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:12,520
now this was actually the slide that I

00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,379
wanted to show but it's just an image so

00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:21,719
that's not really any text on my slides

00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:21,719
so I'm going to skip this a disclaimer

00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:28,210
before we start there is no easy recipe

00:08:25,149 --> 00:08:29,469
for open source communities this

00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:32,440
probably shouldn't come as a big

00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:34,269
surprise building a human community is

00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:37,209
something that doesn't happen overnight

00:08:34,269 --> 00:08:39,459
and it takes a continuous effort to

00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:43,449
nourish a community now we will look at

00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:47,649
some of the key aspects for that so bear

00:08:43,449 --> 00:08:50,170
with me but you need to invest long term

00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:56,260
in a community to see the benefits and

00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:59,250
to see it grow so let's look at why do

00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:01,529
you actually want to build a community

00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:06,209
so before we look

00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:07,949
how let's start with why so a very good

00:09:06,209 --> 00:09:12,149
reason for studying community is to

00:09:07,949 --> 00:09:15,180
attract attention to your to yourself to

00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:17,970
your company and that's a rather selfish

00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:21,149
reason right but believe it or not it's

00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:22,559
one of the reasons people work in open

00:09:21,149 --> 00:09:25,199
source and and that's completely fine

00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:27,930
some people try to get as many stars as

00:09:25,199 --> 00:09:30,149
possible and github and some companies

00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:34,199
of course uses to attract attention to

00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:36,089
the company or a product which are a

00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:39,660
service that they build using the open

00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:42,720
source product or they're looking for to

00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:45,149
promote the ecosystem or it's just that

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,689
they want to sell subscriptions but of

00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:51,269
course it's not a no-brainer but it's a

00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:54,170
good reason to start a suburban source

00:09:51,269 --> 00:09:57,029
project and build a community

00:09:54,170 --> 00:10:00,199
another reason building a community is

00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:02,610
useful for company is recruiting because

00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:04,980
companies who are good at with open

00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,750
source they usually are favored by

00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:10,829
developers and they can acquire

00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:12,600
engineers more easily now a really

00:10:10,829 --> 00:10:15,629
important aspect of course is innovation

00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:19,199
and ideas if you have a strong community

00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:21,600
you basically have like a super machine

00:10:19,199 --> 00:10:25,079
for exchanging ideas and driving

00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,389
innovation and the feedback loop you get

00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:30,389
in an open source project is it's

00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:34,379
typically much faster than in closed

00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:39,980
communities so you can make races more

00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:42,389
often and just move faster also if you

00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:45,120
if you work in the community you might

00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:47,779
be able to save costs because you share

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,370
maintenance testing and innovation and

00:10:47,779 --> 00:10:53,009
you just have to do your small part

00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:54,750
ideally right but still if there's no

00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:56,360
community you will have to build it and

00:10:54,750 --> 00:11:00,089
it's gonna be work

00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:04,110
another reason is you for building a new

00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:05,579
community is forking because you realize

00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,139
you're you're unsatisfied with an

00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:10,980
existing community and you want to

00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:13,649
forget fork it now that's usually not a

00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,570
good idea but there are some exceptions

00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:18,449
like if you look at

00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:21,060
the Jenkins community which was forked

00:11:18,449 --> 00:11:22,620
from from Hudson that worked all right

00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:27,690
and there was a good reason for doing

00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:29,670
that and the last reason I have for why

00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:33,079
you should build a community is open

00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:36,959
source is fun right exchanging ideas

00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:39,269
making new connections just sharing

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:43,199
resources it's a it's a modern mindset

00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:47,100
that that we share things and because

00:11:43,199 --> 00:11:50,880
not sharing is kind of the past in my

00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:53,279
opinion so instead of just you know

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,139
building a community from scratch

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:57,329
maybe there's already community that

00:11:55,139 --> 00:12:00,120
would fit your needs and in this case

00:11:57,329 --> 00:12:06,470
you could join an existing one and focus

00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:06,470
on what is important there for you so

00:12:07,069 --> 00:12:15,240
with that out of the way let's take a

00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:18,600
look at what makes a community so

00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:22,680
basically have like four topics let's

00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:27,269
say number one is code number two is

00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:32,279
people and number three is processes and

00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:37,970
lastly what do I have last its ownership

00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:40,850
which is probably almost important point

00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:43,639
so let's start with code

00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:47,190
why is code important for a community

00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:49,199
well if you want to build a community

00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:51,180
you have to build around a meaningful

00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:53,970
piece of software it's an it's a

00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:56,459
software community right so if you don't

00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:58,439
provide value to people basically

00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:03,120
nobody's gonna care about your project

00:12:58,439 --> 00:13:04,380
if there's already existing solution you

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,230
know and you're trying you're doing the

00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:09,839
same thing that already exists you know

00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:13,019
there's usually little incentive for

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,970
people to join your community also code

00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:19,949
itself attracts a certain kind of

00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:22,829
community think about let's say about

00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:25,500
the complexity about ease-of-use about

00:13:22,829 --> 00:13:27,959
what programming language you use all

00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,310
that has an influence on the type of

00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:32,850
community

00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:35,040
compare for example a lisp project and a

00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:38,209
JavaScript project it's very different

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:42,959
kind of people who work on that and

00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:45,350
databases and web frameworks again huge

00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:47,790
difference so you should ask yourself

00:13:45,350 --> 00:13:49,620
how do you know how could you know the

00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:52,050
people or the type of people that could

00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:56,360
contribute and of course is there a

00:13:52,050 --> 00:14:01,519
demand for a community around your code

00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:10,800
so we had code now let's look at people

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:15,209
and I put I put this molecule picture

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:21,319
there or is it our universe picture and

00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:24,480
because a community consists of layers

00:14:21,319 --> 00:14:27,569
which I of course moving all the time

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,610
but if most most people when they when

00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:32,850
you think about people in the source

00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:35,579
community they say well they are users

00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:38,819
they are developers and their

00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:42,029
contributors and that's a very simple

00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:43,319
model again like users what users are

00:14:42,029 --> 00:14:45,319
for developers developers and

00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:49,980
contributors are kind of doing both and

00:14:45,319 --> 00:14:50,850
but they're not really developers yeah I

00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,490
mean it

00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:55,290
in reality it's much more complex of

00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:57,600
course because the software developers

00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:59,790
if you think about it they're rarely

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,329
employed by the project I think there

00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:04,920
are you know they are definitely project

00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:07,100
where that's the case but it's also

00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:12,149
question if that's good usually

00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:13,679
developers work in companies and there

00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:19,139
you have across the source funding

00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:21,120
problem and people who work on your

00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:22,649
poster house but on your open source

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,259
project in the community they have

00:15:22,649 --> 00:15:28,290
different goals and and you should

00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:29,790
acknowledge that so don't expect that

00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:32,160
everyone can spend the same amount of

00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:33,860
time in the community and but you know

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,600
still give them a chance to contribute

00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:38,160
if you have a component that's really

00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,740
important don't you know rely on a

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,020
single person single maintainer building

00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,810
some redundancy otherwise

00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:49,170
if there's maintainer burnout which does

00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:53,720
happen frequently you yeah you have a

00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:57,270
problem basically in your community and

00:15:53,720 --> 00:16:00,120
recognize that your community can span

00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:02,550
outside the codomain this is a very old

00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:05,820
model that we are all coders in the

00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:08,880
community nowadays you know there are so

00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:10,410
many tasks which are important in open

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:15,830
source prominent community that don't

00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:19,410
require coding and then also think about

00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:21,720
the people behind you know developers or

00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:23,760
people actors actively contributing who

00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,100
are the decision-makers every project

00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:29,010
has you know these people that you know

00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:31,170
back back the project and if you can

00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:35,370
find a way to reach out those to these

00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:38,040
people then and acknowledge that they're

00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,900
there it can be very helpful for your

00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:45,920
community

00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:48,930
also think about writers bloggers

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:51,510
evangelists and generally people into

00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:55,740
the ethic enthusiastic about your code

00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:58,710
or your community if you make it easy

00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:01,050
for those people to reach out and you

00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:03,660
you probably have the better stories and

00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:07,440
you can share more about what your

00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:10,020
project is doing so ideally you want to

00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:11,250
have all kinds of roles present you want

00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:15,290
to have coders you want to have

00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:18,089
architects you want to have organizers

00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:21,330
supporters people ask questions and

00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:24,209
people answer questions so you need

00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:26,370
those diverse roles so the question is

00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:29,660
how you know how do I get those people

00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:33,000
and how do I get such a rich community

00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:35,130
well every community needs a group of

00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,290
people who can take responsibility for

00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:41,130
the project and I call that the critical

00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:45,330
mass which is probably best described

00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:47,400
you know as this inner thoughts you know

00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:51,330
in the Indies in this image here on the

00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:54,030
slide and it's the critical mass is like

00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:56,169
diverse group of people with different

00:17:54,030 --> 00:18:00,070
background different interests

00:17:56,169 --> 00:18:04,899
and also varying experience and these

00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:07,419
people basically they may make sure that

00:18:04,899 --> 00:18:09,220
the project runs and in the beginning

00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,850
that could mean just starting off the

00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,489
project

00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:15,210
so donating the code lines it licensing

00:18:12,489 --> 00:18:17,879
it appropriately trading by Lars

00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:21,580
creating a code of conduct and

00:18:17,879 --> 00:18:23,080
contribution guidelines but also in the

00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:27,239
day-to-day business they're really

00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:29,769
important because they can like drive

00:18:27,239 --> 00:18:32,859
discussions on the mailing list it can

00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:37,720
answer questions on the main lists or on

00:18:32,859 --> 00:18:39,609
on other platforms and basically they

00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,100
ensure that the project stays relevant

00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:45,850
with regards to technology which is

00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:47,950
really important for a project then of

00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:51,639
course getting rid of technical debt is

00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:55,480
an important point and ensuring that the

00:18:51,639 --> 00:18:57,580
project infrastructure works there are

00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,179
also other tasks like media mediating

00:18:57,580 --> 00:19:02,830
conflicts recognizing contributions to

00:19:01,179 --> 00:19:05,950
the projects that are really important

00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:09,190
in for example in some of the projects I

00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:13,539
worked we have we we we always try to

00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:16,749
encourage new contributors to contribute

00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:20,190
more and we gave them feedback we also

00:19:16,749 --> 00:19:23,200
like celebrated let's say 1,000 PRS or

00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:27,159
innovate and anniversary anniversaries

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:32,230
of the project but you also need a core

00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:34,659
group of people who go beyond just the

00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:37,539
day-to-day work you need also people to

00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:40,840
organize meetups and conferences writing

00:19:37,539 --> 00:19:42,789
articles and books and also you know

00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:46,239
promote the project on social media and

00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:52,720
being excited about it so how do you

00:19:46,239 --> 00:19:56,950
find the critical mass well I have a

00:19:52,720 --> 00:20:00,700
good quote here by young Lena who is the

00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:02,859
CouchDB PMC or share chair sorry so

00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:06,399
supreme swimmer but he's the chair and

00:20:02,859 --> 00:20:08,019
he says on his blog I try to be involved

00:20:06,399 --> 00:20:09,970
with every threat on the main list

00:20:08,019 --> 00:20:11,830
showing exemplary behavior

00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:14,200
being nice to people taking the issue

00:20:11,830 --> 00:20:16,240
seriously trying to be helpful

00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,029
overall after a while people stuck

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,100
around not only to ask questions but to

00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:24,190
help with answering as well and to my

00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:26,799
complete delight they mimic my style so

00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:28,899
I think the critical mass is like the

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:32,259
role model of the community it all

00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:34,649
starts with maybe just a few people but

00:20:32,259 --> 00:20:39,070
it grows over time as you show these

00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:41,139
exemplary behavior and you motivate

00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:46,769
other people to be active in your

00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:51,340
community so the third point is

00:20:46,769 --> 00:20:58,210
processes processes are super important

00:20:51,340 --> 00:21:01,990
in a project because em if you if it's

00:20:58,210 --> 00:21:04,690
not clear to somebody who joins what the

00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:06,909
processes are then you know it it takes

00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:11,350
a lot of time to to learn about that and

00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:12,789
it also creates it creates some huge

00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:14,710
barrier between the people who are

00:21:12,789 --> 00:21:19,210
already part of the community and the

00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:20,769
people who are trying to join so

00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:25,779
basically you need to document all of

00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:28,269
this and and you and you could start

00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:31,049
with workflows like how do you

00:21:28,269 --> 00:21:35,350
contribute to the project what are the

00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:39,429
parts of your project that need support

00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:42,100
how are changes reviewed how do we

00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:44,529
document if we make changes how do we

00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:47,590
test them and how do we release software

00:21:44,529 --> 00:21:50,440
that all needs to be written down and be

00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:54,429
very clear then also communication needs

00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:56,080
to be clear what tools do we use where

00:21:54,429 --> 00:21:58,960
is what is the source of truth is it's

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:01,210
like or is the main ones or do we use

00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:05,230
mailing lists do we have a code of

00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:10,769
conduct for everyone to be on the same

00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:14,590
page and then also how how do we earn

00:22:10,769 --> 00:22:17,169
merit so in a lot of communities you get

00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:21,129
basically more permissions to work on

00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:22,629
code based on merit and the problem with

00:22:21,129 --> 00:22:23,570
this is that the merit needs to be

00:22:22,629 --> 00:22:25,370
recognized by

00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:29,450
someone who's already in the inner

00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:33,320
circle and yeah connected to that is the

00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:35,960
decision-making how do we decide based

00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:40,760
on constants majority and who has the

00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:42,650
final say and of course their legal

00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:47,420
legal processes that also need to be

00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:49,820
watched out for and compliance yeah all

00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:55,240
these should be formalized and written

00:22:49,820 --> 00:23:00,020
down as much as possible

00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:04,370
speaking about compliance let's let's

00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:08,720
take a look at the last ingredient of a

00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:11,210
community which is ownership now

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:15,890
ownership is often associated with the

00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:18,050
license of the code so we have licenses

00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:21,040
like public domain

00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:25,250
we have missive licenses like the Apache

00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:27,680
License BSD license ma MIT license but

00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:32,180
we also have like copyleft license GPL

00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:35,780
and others and we have proprietary

00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:37,400
license licenses are kind of important

00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:39,740
for the community as well because they

00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,420
said like the legal framework and they

00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:44,870
influenced the type of community which

00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:47,900
can grow around a piece of software that

00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:50,390
is licensed so for example if the apache

00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:53,330
license doesn't require you to conjure

00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:56,060
read back which may seem like a

00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:58,010
disadvantage for your community but it's

00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:00,410
also a great way to grow the adoption of

00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:04,910
your project and that could that

00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:07,730
eventually could help your community but

00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:11,240
ownership also applies not only to code

00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:15,500
but also to infrastructure repositories

00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:17,840
manglers chat servers and the name of

00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:24,940
the project actually which is often

00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:29,840
trademarked and ultimately ownership is

00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:31,550
is like the like the the most important

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,320
thing for a decision-making governance

00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:36,770
because if somebody owns the project

00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:39,740
then he or she can just take it away and

00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:45,890
and that's that can be a problem in the

00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:51,530
most in most project we have two kind of

00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:55,070
two different models one is the model of

00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:57,410
the panel event dictator which was

00:24:55,070 --> 00:25:00,140
coined by guido van rossum and also

00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:02,960
lived in the linux project by Leamas

00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:05,240
towards and it has some advantages

00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:07,100
because you can you have really tight

00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:11,170
control over the project and you

00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:14,510
basically can control it if you own it

00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:17,960
but it's also a bottleneck and limits

00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:20,990
limos limos solve this problem by for

00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,730
example writing get which got the Condor

00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:25,790
kernel development to scale again with

00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:27,650
him as as the vanilla bean dictator but

00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:29,870
that's not really feasible for a lot of

00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:31,850
project since that we have foundations

00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:34,550
we have the patchy software foundation

00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:36,740
of the Python Foundation Linux

00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:39,290
Foundation Eclipse and of course the

00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:42,140
Free Software Foundation so in my eyes

00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:45,440
the Apache and the free software

00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:50,180
foundation probably the most independent

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:51,860
and open ones because they accept while

00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:54,620
they do accept donations from the

00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:58,640
outside the only way to influence the

00:25:54,620 --> 00:26:01,040
project is by gaining merit in them so

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,140
merit Meighan means that you get through

00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:05,000
your contributions through doing

00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:11,780
something meaningful you get a committer

00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:13,550
ship or some rights in the project in

00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,910
the linux and pythons of rotation

00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:19,360
actually also have the merit based model

00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:21,260
but you can also donate money and you

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:25,690
automatically get a saying in the

00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:25,690
project decision which is again a

00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,560
different way to define the ownership

00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,810
and that has an influence on the

00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:35,720
community so in the end it doesn't

00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:38,120
matter but you have to decide what is

00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:44,000
best for your what governance model is

00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:45,950
best for your community so yeah there

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,230
you have it I mean a good community is

00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:50,060
one which solve all the problem or at

00:26:48,230 --> 00:27:02,500
least address

00:26:50,060 --> 00:27:06,170
system in in some way so let's look at

00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:10,480
some of the points that could be tricky

00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:10,480
in the process of building a community

00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:19,790
so first of all you should take orcas or

00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:21,260
seriously if you just dump your code

00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:24,190
somewhere and you think you're the

00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:26,930
community is built going to build itself

00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:29,930
it's not going to work it's been proven

00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:34,490
and so you need to think about that in

00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:36,230
advance you know it and approach this in

00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:42,470
a structured way then you should

00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:44,270
communicate openly and be patient lack

00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:49,430
of funding and monetization can be a

00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:52,340
real problem because yeah you should

00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:54,470
make sure that your project can be

00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:56,840
financed somehow and people can make a

00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:58,970
living with it this is often very tricky

00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:03,520
and I don't have a definite answer for

00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:03,520
that but at least think about that and

00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:09,980
another thing that can happen is that

00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:13,490
your users are unsatisfied and that

00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:19,160
things break and you should have a plan

00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:21,590
how to endure a dress this concern and I

00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:24,200
already mentioned that earlier if you

00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:26,810
have people too few people walking on

00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:31,070
stuff maintain a burnout is is very real

00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:34,460
so reach out in advance so or try to

00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:37,490
find somebody else and introduce him or

00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:40,880
her so you can have some redundancy

00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:42,260
built in and in every project they're

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,360
going to be arguments and heated

00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:47,060
discussions that's pretty normal but

00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:51,350
make sure that you you know speak

00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:56,270
civilized and you know moderate these

00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:59,180
discussions in the end project can die

00:28:56,270 --> 00:29:01,250
and reputation can suffer actually if

00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:04,179
you put your name somewhere or

00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:08,350
associated with the

00:29:04,179 --> 00:29:10,999
and yeah

00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:14,029
since open-source communities can do

00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:16,720
harm perhaps you talk on building a

00:29:14,029 --> 00:29:16,720
community first

00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:25,340
so before we conclude I want to take a

00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:29,690
look at two project one is Apache

00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:32,330
filling and the other one Apache bean so

00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:36,230
flink is it's a stream technology me

00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:38,749
processing technology it was it was a

00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:41,840
research project and then a company came

00:29:38,749 --> 00:29:48,019
and wanted to build a community around

00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:52,730
it to ultimately also drive the adoption

00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:55,659
of link and I think Flint did a lot of

00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:58,460
things right because they embraced

00:29:55,659 --> 00:30:00,230
open-source from the beginning so it

00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:02,659
meant while I was working at the company

00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:05,539
that built fully that we we didn't

00:30:02,659 --> 00:30:07,789
discuss anything internally anymore we

00:30:05,539 --> 00:30:09,769
shared everything on the mailing list we

00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:12,679
discussed lemmings we shared design

00:30:09,769 --> 00:30:15,590
documents and we also store ghen eyes

00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:20,450
meetups around the world from the very

00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:25,639
beginning of when after we founded the

00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:27,379
company we also started a conference or

00:30:25,639 --> 00:30:29,239
out fling around Flint code fling

00:30:27,379 --> 00:30:34,039
forward which is still running every day

00:30:29,239 --> 00:30:36,230
at every year and here in Berlin and in

00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:39,559
San Francisco and also the community

00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:41,419
expanded to China in 2016 now the

00:30:39,559 --> 00:30:44,960
company was actually born in bought in

00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:47,090
2019 by a company called Alibaba but

00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,950
what is amazing about this is that this

00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:51,649
corporation went on for many years

00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:55,179
before and still continues and that I

00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:58,460
think is a huge success of an open

00:30:55,179 --> 00:31:00,230
community that you know functions

00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:04,129
despite you know of course money being

00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:07,149
involved and then there's Apache beem

00:31:04,129 --> 00:31:10,100
beem was originally a Google project and

00:31:07,149 --> 00:31:12,429
it was put on github without any clear

00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:17,120
of missouri's contribution guidelines

00:31:12,429 --> 00:31:23,070
just you know asked piece of code

00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:26,700
but in 2016 patchy beam or the code that

00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:29,580
was Apache beam joined the Apache

00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:31,110
Software Foundation and I think beam did

00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:33,000
a lot of things right because it had

00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:36,470
very clear contribution guidelines so in

00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,730
the beginning we regularly evaluate

00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:41,940
contributors for committed ship and send

00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:45,240
out encouragement emails we have very

00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:47,570
early awarded committer ship for non

00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:51,630
call contributions which at that time

00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:54,809
few projects were doing and still not

00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:59,669
norm I would say and we also organize

00:31:54,809 --> 00:32:02,760
beam summit which is a conference which

00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:09,840
takes place in August this year and we

00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:12,630
also do meetups of course so I'm kind of

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:16,620
running out of time here so let me

00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:21,090
conclude with just five secrets to

00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:22,890
building a strong community of course

00:32:21,090 --> 00:32:26,070
building a community is not an easy task

00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:27,900
and I'm sorry if you if you wanted to

00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:30,960
watch this talk to you know get the

00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:33,240
definite answer and the the clear way to

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:36,960
success that I'm sorry I couldn't share

00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:38,669
it with you but I hope I could describe

00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,620
some of the important aspects of

00:32:38,669 --> 00:32:43,470
building a community

00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:47,820
so to summarize here are five secrets

00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:51,840
and which I already covered so first one

00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:53,910
is communicate openly you know it so

00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,720
called open source for a reason if so

00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:59,309
you should make sure that everything is

00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,440
is openly and transparently in your

00:32:59,309 --> 00:33:04,380
project that's the only way somebody

00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:09,500
who's new to your project can join your

00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:12,059
community then document well this

00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:15,809
actually ties with the communication as

00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:18,510
well so everything that you do should be

00:33:15,809 --> 00:33:23,010
should be documented so people don't

00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:25,710
have to you know dig into like old

00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:27,419
mailing lists discussions to find out

00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:28,390
you know what what was actually cited

00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:31,390
there so

00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:35,200
Yeah right design documents right good

00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:37,990
commit transcriptions always make sure

00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,880
to document and I cannot emphasize this

00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:42,940
enough you need to innovate frequently

00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:45,340
because open source projects you know

00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:47,380
they are also a very competitive market

00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:49,660
their new project starting all the time

00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:54,309
so in order for your communities to

00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:56,799
survive you need to innovate recruiting

00:33:54,309 --> 00:33:59,350
is super important because eventually

00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:00,880
enough to believe people are going to

00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:03,760
leave your community they're going to go

00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:06,130
to a different job they they forget

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,590
about you and if you don't recruit new

00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:14,109
people all the time then your community

00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:17,050
is in danger of dying yeah and and the

00:34:14,109 --> 00:34:19,450
last point is the relationship if you

00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:22,570
foster relationship for example Viera

00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:24,730
meet meetups or conferences you are

00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:27,190
building the foundation for your

00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:29,889
community because ultimately we are all

00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:35,050
humans and everything is about

00:34:29,889 --> 00:34:37,780
relationships so I believe with the

00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:39,220
critical mass that I mentioned or with a

00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:42,609
critical mass you can build a foundation

00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:45,879
for your community and it might be small

00:34:42,609 --> 00:34:48,429
in the beginning but if you show

00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:51,220
exemplary behavior and if you always

00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:56,020
reach out and and be and you're open to

00:34:51,220 --> 00:35:01,540
new members then your community will be

00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:04,210
successful with that I want to conclude

00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:07,080
and I think we have some time for

00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:11,010
questions now thank you

00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:16,570
Thank You max for this activating talk

00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:19,930
about building a community I have one

00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:22,570
question from evolution who is asking

00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:25,720
what examples of open source projects

00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:28,840
that succeeded without backup from

00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:31,900
commercial entities can you give and of

00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:34,180
course and this is the most pylos

00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,980
offical part of the question first we

00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:41,560
would we should have to define success

00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:42,900
and without have to repeat the question

00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:46,630
now is a

00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:48,340
well yeah I get it I think there are a

00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:53,430
lot of examples of successful

00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:56,550
communities for exact project that don't

00:35:53,430 --> 00:36:01,110
you know are not financially very

00:35:56,550 --> 00:36:04,030
successful for example anything like

00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:06,880
this is tool called YouTube download for

00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:08,830
example which really which has an

00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:12,880
amazing community I've been using this

00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:15,010
for some years and you know everybody is

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,390
always you know so helpful there and

00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:18,940
when whenever you know there's a new

00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:21,700
side which is this basically download

00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:24,370
script for few for downloading YouTube

00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:29,500
videos but also like all kinds of

00:36:24,370 --> 00:36:30,670
episodes videos you find on the Internet

00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:33,090
which is really nice if you want to

00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:36,130
archive them just in utility but um

00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:40,620
that's a really good project that is not

00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:45,880
a commercial project also I think

00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:48,850
ultimately you know that a lot of

00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:51,640
project who like say Firefox or

00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:56,530
Thunderbird which where you have really

00:36:51,640 --> 00:37:01,270
have a foundation behind it like also

00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:03,760
with Apache project which it's for

00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:05,320
exhibit the case of book fire Mozilla is

00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:09,840
it's really just doing good for the

00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:12,490
people and not primarily profit oriented

00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:14,710
and the other part of the question was

00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:19,480
what what do you how do you find success

00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:22,150
I think you define it how do you define

00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:25,240
it and and for example yeah low changes

00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:27,550
added what was for example the critical

00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:30,760
mass the size of community that makes

00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:33,040
Ana pursue projects successful like when

00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:35,020
you have five five thousand stars and

00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:41,440
github just stopped being successful or

00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:46,120
how is it counted yeah I don't think

00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:48,550
there is like a magical metric that

00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,970
shows you if a project is successful or

00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:51,310
not

00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:54,370
I think it's successful if people use it

00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:55,720
but I mean even if they're just a

00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:58,960
handful people using it

00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:01,540
those people are having fun and you know

00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:03,880
they share experiences that's that's a

00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:07,000
success for me I mean what is not a

00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:09,670
success to me is I think if you know and

00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,920
they're a lot of project like that who

00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:15,220
we're basically like one person build

00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:18,460
something and a lot of people use it but

00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:22,660
you know the community around it doesn't

00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:25,599
grow and that person just you know works

00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:27,760
his ass or her ass off and nothing

00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:30,550
happened get ocularly it's tackling

00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:34,570
issues where it doesn't work like I want

00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:37,570
or something like that yeah yeah and

00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:40,330
also of course if you know nobody you

00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:45,820
get users if there's just that code on

00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:46,420
github I think that's a failure no more

00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,940
questions

00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:51,450
on my side thank you max whoa thanks for

00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:51,450
