sweet thank you Charlie can you guys

00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:17,419
hear me okay yeah

00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:19,490
can you see me okay yep cool all right

00:00:17,419 --> 00:00:22,610
well that's good for me bad for y'all so

00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:24,769
I wanted to just say thanks to everybody

00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:28,880
coming to this talk I'm kind of very

00:00:24,769 --> 00:00:33,230
very green in the search rope I joined

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:35,540
osc back at the end of 2019 and I've

00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:38,180
just started to dip my toes into NOP

00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:40,879
search so this is the little kind of

00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:43,760
real life story about that so motivation

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,260
for this talk is everywhere I turn

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,909
around when I'm reading blogs and stuff

00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,519
trying to get up to speed everyone's

00:00:46,909 --> 00:00:53,420
talking about dense factors right all

00:00:49,519 --> 00:00:56,260
these fancy schmancy BIRT based encoding

00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:58,580
machines that are really kind of just

00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:03,080
tearing apart benchmarks left and right

00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:05,750
so what I wanted to do was try and apply

00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:08,390
some of that so this is kind of like the

00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,990
background requirements for what I'm

00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:10,369
talking about

00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:13,520
let's talk kind of the things that made

00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:15,350
what I'm doing possible is this kind of

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,990
idea of since transformers right that's

00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,520
not really new that that's a link I

00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,799
dropped a link in slack too if you guys

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,630
want to click along I tried to link out

00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:25,999
all of the resources that I'm using so

00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:27,350
you can follow along I'll touch on data

00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:28,700
a little bit I can't really share an

00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:31,490
example dataset but I'll tell you why in

00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:34,579
a slide so the background really is that

00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:36,229
there's wonderful pre-trained models out

00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:38,600
there designed to get at this idea of

00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:41,840
sentence similarity or or meaning

00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:44,450
inference and elastic has made some big

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:48,530
releases to kind of allow this kind this

00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:52,069
kind of data this new kind of feature to

00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:55,189
come in to elastic recently so the dense

00:01:52,069 --> 00:01:57,710
vector released in 7.0 and then really

00:01:55,189 --> 00:02:00,380
what made it super useful for people is

00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:01,520
that you can actually now they

00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,280
introduced this cosine similarity

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,889
function and so cosine similarity really

00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:09,020
is just an idea that you're gonna find

00:02:06,889 --> 00:02:11,600
out what's most similar in terms of

00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:14,660
angle and distance and angle and a

00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,340
vector space so things that should be

00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,650
kind of on the same mark and the idea is

00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,160
that that would surface ideally like

00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:24,420
like intention door

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:28,140
like like documents and so the the

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:32,310
specific application context here for me

00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:36,080
is the trek news track my background

00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:39,960
before coming to OSC was working in

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,360
pharma biotech and when I found out kind

00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,480
of about this conference Trek as a way

00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,790
to get started in IR I was able to kind

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,010
of talk a bunch of my OSD colleagues

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:53,160
into chaperoning Mia if we did an entry

00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:55,200
into it and so we've decided to go ahead

00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:59,280
and enter Trek the trek news track for

00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,890
2020 this is a cool competition hosted

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,240
every year by the NIS T up in

00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,780
Gaithersburg Maryland right around

00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,550
Washington DC it's free to enter they

00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,080
give you a lot of nice data that's

00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,880
already got some human judgments to go

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,770
along with it but when you do enter you

00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,420
sign some kind of agreements about

00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,070
releasing corpuses and releasing

00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,640
judgments and material because they want

00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:22,650
to keep the competition you know open it

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,870
are just like durable going forward so

00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:27,360
that's why I can't really share all the

00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,800
data that's involved with this before

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,590
but hopefully it gets a flavor for it

00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,870
and you can hook you can apply this kind

00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:36,450
of stuff to any any data that you can

00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,860
parse into sentence tokens and I know

00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:40,620
probably everyone listening is a better

00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,000
data engineer than I am so that probably

00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:44,190
won't be that won't be the sticking

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,750
point for getting NLP embedded into your

00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:51,000
search but the goal here really in terms

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,220
of the specific track which is just kind

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,680
of like um a sub competition at track is

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,120
is given a document so imagine we're

00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,660
reading we're reading The Washington

00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,000
Post side ourselves given a document

00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:06,300
what other links should I read to find

00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,500
out more about that document say oh I

00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,640
want to be able to go a little deeper

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm going to understand the background

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,709
context a little bit that that's really

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,890
the goal of this kind of feature if you

00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:18,090
can imagine what it would look like

00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:21,090
downstream when it's actually deployed

00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:22,919
into their production system so the the

00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:27,090
corpus is made up of roughly 600,000

00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:29,160
articles that when I pulled it into an

00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:31,140
index not the most efficient index ever

00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,960
right we're tuning for relevancy here

00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,600
but

00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,699
it was two gigabytes and then when I

00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,190
added dense vectors it blew up to 13

00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:42,520
gigabytes so I just wanted to kind of

00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:44,319
call that out and in the sense of how

00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,789
big some of these dense vector things

00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,740
can get right dense vectors they're

00:04:45,789 --> 00:04:49,210
dense for a reason they're heavy there's

00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,220
a lot of numbers floating in there so

00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,990
there better be some bang for your buck

00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:55,630
in terms of performance which are

00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:59,160
getting out so like any good experiment

00:04:55,630 --> 00:05:02,080
I wanted to set a reasonable baseline

00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,729
and the baseline I decided to try and go

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,270
against for performances the more like

00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:08,770
this query in elasticsearch this is

00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:11,590
really designed for this kind of

00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,120
specific task almost it doesn't

00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,680
necessarily take into account the

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,410
background something that happened in

00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,729
the past right that would be relevant to

00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,380
an article but we could accomplish that

00:05:18,729 --> 00:05:23,199
with another filter but it does a really

00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:25,810
good job of honing in on articles that

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,699
share a lot of tokens and hopefully

00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:31,210
that's a lot of kind of meaning

00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:34,509
similarity to and like it does really

00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:37,509
good it's based on BM 25 we know how

00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:39,220
good BM 25 is and so why not just lean

00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:42,729
in and see effect if there's can kind of

00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:45,610
how they compare against this so for

00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:47,849
doing so if you're doing embeddings let

00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:51,130
me see I have a select message

00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:53,789
fullscreen okay yep

00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:57,969
oh I think you want to do like this so

00:05:53,789 --> 00:06:00,070
so for embeddings I'm only using the

00:05:57,969 --> 00:06:01,990
title field only let me just bounce over

00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:05,169
and show you guys an example document

00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:08,280
real quick so we can just kind of see

00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:11,320
what what one document will look like so

00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,810
this this is a document in this room

00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:16,150
there's kind of a title field kicker is

00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:17,860
the section contents is the first

00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:21,370
paragraph contents two second paragraph

00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:23,349
contents all all the paragraphs but I'm

00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,530
only doing the title and the idea there

00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:28,330
is that I was just kind of going after

00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:30,460
this the similarity there on one

00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,680
sentence I'm using this distill burp

00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:35,770
model apologies for the early switch

00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,960
this disturber model out of this ukp lab

00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,909
which is a fantastic github repo if you

00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,349
guys want to learn more about this I

00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:44,199
highly recommend starting there they

00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:45,370
have lots of great examples and I want

00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:47,470
to call out that I'm not doing

00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:49,449
fine tuning on this model right I'm just

00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:51,250
getting started with NLP haven't

00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:54,190
exported that would look like definitely

00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:56,500
haven't sat down to label the data in

00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:58,900
terms of this this model the model they

00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,690
trained is actually designed around

00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:05,169
inference similarity between sentences

00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:07,810
so whether they agree or contradict were

00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:09,220
the labels that they built out to to

00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:11,680
train this model so I'd have to do

00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,900
something similar to what they did to

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,330
keep going in that soda I haven't sat

00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,520
down to do it this is just what you get

00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:20,770
right off of the download this is the

00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,240
collab research notebook that I've

00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:25,960
shared with everyone so you guys can see

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,150
it's over here all things told it's like

00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:30,699
15 little blocks and they're all pretty

00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:32,590
short from importing everything to

00:07:30,699 --> 00:07:36,580
fitting the model to pickling things out

00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:39,520
so I can use them back in my index so

00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:41,080
the code is not intimidating like I

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,010
think the concepts and the meaning

00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,919
behind it are still are still

00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:47,229
intimidating for me though so let's talk

00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:50,349
a little bit about performance I wanted

00:07:47,229 --> 00:07:53,169
to kind of jump back into Kabana now so

00:07:50,349 --> 00:07:55,090
we can go through this but we start off

00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:57,280
with kind of just a more like this query

00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:59,800
against title and so if this is the

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,419
document right here this Lake Braddock's

00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,240
which is a high school in Northern

00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:07,150
Virginia Erin Hollins who is a football

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,919
player if we're trying to find documents

00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,870
most similar to these high school

00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:13,960
football contexts let's see more like

00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:16,860
this does a pretty good job for us off

00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:20,620
the bat right this is already getting

00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,849
late late Braddock's Natalie Butler it's

00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:25,330
another high school athlete for like

00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:26,949
Braddock Bronco Mendenhall is actually

00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:30,270
he happens to be a running back so this

00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:32,770
phrase has come out of nowhere before is

00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:34,479
kind of maybe it's a similar descriptor

00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:36,039
for running backs again we're heading

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,110
Lake Braddock right and remember this is

00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:40,089
just kind of here it's a little crazy

00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,550
where we get into Bernie Sanders has

00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:46,209
emerged so as the Donald Trump of the

00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:48,220
left so this is just running on those

00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:50,290
tokens at that point ensure doing a more

00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,089
like this search in a title field

00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,620
probably doesn't matter isn't isn't the

00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:56,560
best doesn't matter is the wrong thing

00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:58,550
to say isn't the best way to go about it

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,740
you'd like to expand it to maybe be the

00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:04,160
all document but just to keep things

00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:07,279
fair that's what I'm doing here so if we

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,990
if we just do the way the way elastic is

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,660
implemented the cosine similarity stuff

00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:13,670
it's really kind of just as a script

00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,290
score so in order to really run it over

00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:18,260
the entire document I'm just dropping

00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:20,000
this match all in and the idea here is

00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:22,820
that I've already gone and kind of hand

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,130
encoded the title from this document and

00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,149
stored it here in the params it's hidden

00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:29,959
because it's huge

00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:32,420
but the idea being that we just used

00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:34,820
that cosine similarity plus 1 because

00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,010
all ranking scores have to be greater

00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:38,570
than 0

00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:40,550
but if we do that we can see the kind of

00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:44,750
the titles we get back and this takes a

00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:47,300
long time right it's running over all of

00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:50,180
those documents and you can see it

00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:52,220
matches itself right which is good that

00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,839
means the embeddings are doing the same

00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:57,260
thing each time they go into the model

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,390
surprise surprise and the next the next

00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:00,410
article trump is openly telling us he's

00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:03,770
above the law

00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:06,860
here's his next move kind of weird to

00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:08,990
see that slip in there Michael Sam is at

00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:12,470
least another football player which is

00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:15,110
reasonable at the Navy Yard there was an

00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:17,050
accident or there was a mass shooting

00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:19,700
actually as what that's about

00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:20,720
unfortunately and then can immigration

00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:23,360
reform and so you see we're getting

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,130
pretty off-topic how to clean outdoor

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,260
furniture right there's a lot of things

00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,370
that don't really make a whole lot of

00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,920
sense in terms of the high school

00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:33,800
football context so what I wanted to do

00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:37,250
next is just kind of run embeddings and

00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:39,200
blend the scores a little bit and so

00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:42,529
this is me kind of just tuning by hand

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,930
nothing crazy and figuring out a blend

00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:47,180
there and so this is this is something

00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:50,209
kind of similar but we're getting back

00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:51,770
towards Lake Braddock and we are giving

00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:55,940
a little more diversity than our first

00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:57,800
just BM 25 base search it's interesting

00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:00,019
because you see some themes kind of come

00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,269
up in here like an individual athlete

00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:05,269
has emerged is one of the sports top

00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:07,310
people that comes up there with Jay

00:11:05,269 --> 00:11:09,890
Beagle he's an NHL player for the

00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:11,960
Washington Capitals this also this also

00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:14,540
comes up with a

00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:16,010
in a gel er Jordan Binnington and this

00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,890
idea of coming out of nowhere and

00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:20,510
emerging you can see is you know they're

00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,950
not exactly the same words but the model

00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:23,960
is already kind of getting the idea that

00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:29,210
those are similar English constructs or

00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:31,760
contexts and so I just wanted to kind of

00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:33,380
wrap up there in terms of talking about

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,290
because there is some potential right

00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:37,790
for using it to capture the idea but

00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,440
there is some stuff that still doesn't

00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:42,320
really make too much sense and just to

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,120
give an idea of how good the more like

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,010
this could be right we're not using any

00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,540
cosine similarity in this last search

00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:51,200
just more like this across the whole

00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:53,510
document like I alluded to thinning you

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,220
see some pretty pretty solid results

00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:58,460
coming back Reed this is a football

00:11:55,220 --> 00:12:00,380
score against their rivals actually the

00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,960
guy were the running back we're looking

00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:04,250
for is in that game

00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:06,050
Centreville which is another school you

00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:08,480
know ramps up Natalie Butler was a big

00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,470
star for like Braddock so she comes up

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,060
again

00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:12,650
and then this is a basketball from the

00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,840
same school so you get kind of into

00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:16,280
these standout stars and at late

00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,510
Braddock and so it's a pretty good

00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:20,600
search if you want to learn more about

00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:22,160
sports at Lake Braddock right and that's

00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:25,010
kind of one of the goals in this thing

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,140
so just to recap MLT query on titles

00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:30,040
okay you know it starts out pretty good

00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:32,480
only tidal embedding is a little wild

00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,910
you get some different themes in there

00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,010
there are really different different

00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:41,290
nouns or subjects right we bounce from

00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:44,450
Trump to Bernie Sanders to NFL players

00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:45,800
but and then blending is actually pretty

00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:48,530
good you know I've seen a couple talks

00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,790
already here the one that stands out was

00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:51,920
the vespa one kind of talking about

00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:53,090
hybrid approaches so that works out

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,680
pretty well and actually brings some

00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:56,480
diversity in there I'm not sure it's

00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:00,020
really the background task I was looking

00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:02,180
for but and then really just kind of

00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:04,970
taking advantage of the BM 25 power and

00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:07,990
doing more like this on a broader piece

00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:11,480
of the document works works the best and

00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:12,680
so that's my talk sorry you think well

00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,590
thanks for listening so I ran a little

00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:18,110
bit over for Doug but if you guys want

00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:19,610
to reach out to me at all please you can

00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,920
get me on Twitter you can send me an

00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:25,550
email and I'm also on the relevancy

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,420
slacks so feel free to reach out if you

00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,430
want

00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,660
talk about title embedding for any kind

00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:32,660
of embeddings because this is something

00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:34,460
that I think is super fascinating it's

00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:36,290
obviously gonna be here for a while in

00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:38,480
search and I think it's probably

00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:39,920
something when we look back and a couple

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,510
of years will say oh yeah well we all

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,790
had to kind of pick that up a little bit

00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:45,680
just like you know data science and

00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:48,350
stuff was over the last five years you

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,000
know so thanks so much for listening and

00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:51,560
I'm ready for any questions you guys

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,160
might have what's that say thank you

00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:58,340
night we've got one question from slack

00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,780
our time is asking isn't background I II

00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,430
tried to get more background in the

00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:03,650
story more about diversifying the

00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:06,850
results than more like this are you

00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:10,910
getting more missing parts of the story

00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:12,500
yeah so that's a great question and the

00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:14,390
way that the topics phrased I think it's

00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,600
kind of you could interpret it just like

00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:19,790
you said which i think is totally fair

00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:22,520
based on what we've seen kind of in the

00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,810
relevancy judgements on the past years

00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:27,110
of Trek and what they've given us to

00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:29,090
kind of look at as a baseline it seems

00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:31,160
like they want something so if it was us

00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:33,260
it was about Aaron it might be about his

00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,540
freshman year at school would be an

00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:38,240
ideal story in their in their mindset so

00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,860
it'd be like imagine a ruling before the

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,990
Supreme Court and they want to kind of

00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,760
watch the progression of a case to how

00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:46,220
it got there

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,710
and having that time since is something

00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:50,090
I didn't cover but that has to be that's

00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:54,530
a big part of what they're defining is

00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:56,240
relevant to so fantastic well we'll see

00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:57,620
how it goes at Trek looking forward

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,880
right right I'll keep you guys up to

00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,500
date and hopefully I'm gonna port all

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,420
this to a blog post too that's a little

00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:06,440
more durable with an example datasets of

00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:08,660
people you don't know tracts been around

00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,130
a very long time and you can go back in

00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,110
time and see some of all of the

00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:14,930
innovations in IR and search you know

00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:16,520
rate you know appearing in trade

00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,990
competitions going back decades so I

00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,300
would encourage you to check it out it's

00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:22,610
very much in the academic side of IR but

00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:26,080
it's is where a lot of a lot of search

00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:26,080
algorithms have cut their teeth rather

00:15:32,209 --> 00:15:34,269
