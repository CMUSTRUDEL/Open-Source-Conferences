Publication date: 2021-06-23
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2021 #bbuzz
Description: 
	Covid-19 put fuel to rising trends and accelerated changes that would have otherwise taken longer to take place. From remote work, artificial intelligence, and faster shifts to the cloud - businesses were forced to adapt in a tumultuous year. These are having lasting implications for the future of work.

What is this new thing being referred to as “Cloud Engineering” and why is that relevant to the future of work? Jobs requesting AI/ML skills are expected to grow 71% over the next 5 years and is considered one of the most disruptive skill areas of tech (ITCareerfinder/Burning Glass). "since the pandemic struck, investment in AI platforms has skyrocketed, shifting from a 'nice-to-have' initiative to a full-blown business imperative.“ - CIO magazine.

How is AI both good and bad for society? What are the conversations happening on the Future of Work and what will this mean?

thank you for having me and i hope some

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,200
days that i'll be enjoying barbecue in

00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,880
person

00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,119
with you guys at this event instead of

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,680
just doing this virtually

00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,640
i am grace francisco i am from san

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,000
francisco

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,000
and i'll tell you the joke about this a

00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,400
little bit later i did start off

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,199
i care quite some time ago when i was a

00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,199
developer

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,039
for lotus approach which is a very

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,000
popular desktop database

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,680
at ibm way back when and this was during

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,880
an era where much of the web was

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,280
actually static

00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,000
and what i did there was to actually

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,719
take

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,079
our windows based approach forms and

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,399
reports and to

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,079
make them dynamically available on the

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,120
web not an easy feat

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,760
back then when everything was static and

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,960
we were just in the early days of having

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,879
these connectors

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,719
to things like db2 so that we could

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,719
render dynamic data

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,879
but those were fun days in the early

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,360
days of the internet uh we're also

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,200
um we would joke about the idea of ever

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,520
buying anything off the internet

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,439
by the way i progressed to my career i

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,680
went through a variety of startups

00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,799
and eventually i landed at microsoft for

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,200
my first

00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,720
job in developer relations we were

00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,479
called evangelists back then we were

00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,040
developer evangelists and i was the

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,799
first

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,159
developer evangelist for microsoft

00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,159
enterprise tool suite

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:29,119
developer tool suite which was called a

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,960
visual studio team system back then

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,560
i went on from microsoft i spent a good

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,079
eight years there learning the ropes of

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,159
developer relations

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,840
and went to lead developer relations at

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,799
a variety of different organizations

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,399
from

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:45,360
small business uh arenas uh fintech

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,720
consumer gaming uh so i've had the honor

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,880
and privilege of working for some really

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,600
remarkable and amazing companies

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,720
but today i am grace francisco from

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,640
cisco

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,840
yes for real um and uh yes that is that

00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,759
it was just meant to be

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,200
grace francisco of cisco from san

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,479
francisco so

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,960
a little bit of a tongue twister but at

00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,799
least it's memorable

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,280
so for those of you who might be

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,840
familiar with the cisco company name

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,040
you're probably thinking this right

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,200
network hardware

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,520
switches routers and i can understand

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,120
that

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,040
that was where we our roots are from

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,239
that's where a lot of our success was

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,800
once upon a time but did you know if i

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,480
can get my slide to go next

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,280
um remote's not cooperating did you know

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,560
that cisco is actually the fifth largest

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,040
software

00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,319
software yes software company we are a

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,680
software company

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,800
and we actually are participating

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,760
participating member of the cloud native

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,319
computing foundation and we have hybrid

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,080
cloud

00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,360
offerings at cisco and my role is to

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,360
head up to devnet

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,319
which is our developer relations program

00:02:53,360 --> 00:03:01,280
at cisco and we have over 500

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,280
000 developers in our community today

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,480
now i love this i actually really truly

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,680
grew up with this thing that some of you

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,959
may have only seen

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,680
in a museum sadly for me i have fond

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,400
memories

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,480
of fighting over this rotary phone with

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,840
my sister because you only really had

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,400
one phone

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,360
in the house and if you had to call

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,599
several numbers

00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,640
in a day you got a real workout with

00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,799
that finger

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,400
of yours and then also you know if you

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,239
were fighting with your sibling that was

00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,799
another set of things you had to deal

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,760
with but today my kids they each have

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,120
their own phones

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,959
and they're not just calling people in

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,959
fact they rarely use it

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,280
to call people right because they're

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:45,360
texting they're watching videos

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,319
they're playing games it does so much

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,080
more than

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,680
call someone um and you know

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,120
there was a challenge only a few years

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,040
ago where father

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,799
challenged his son and his son's friend

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,840
who were i think 16 at the time

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,680
to figure out how to actually dial out

00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,519
on this kind of phone

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,519
needless to say after five minutes they

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,879
weren't able to accomplish this

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,799
challenge

00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,040
and i promise you you don't really want

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,840
to have to do this with the rotary form

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,840
it really is quite a workout with your

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,840
finger

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,479
and yet today technology is not just in

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,600
our phones

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:25,840
it's absolutely everywhere it's in our

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,680
cars it's in our doorbells it's our

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,320
refrigerators and in fact a friend of

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,880
mine

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,000
was giving me a demo of his toast his

00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,160
smart

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,040
very smart toaster oven where you would

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,120
put something in

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,800
and it would identify the thing the

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,000
piece of meat or the egg wherever you

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,680
stuck in that oven

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,120
and it would figure out how to cook it

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,800
for you automatically

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,520
i know many of you are also wearing

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,520
smart watches to track your fitness

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,520
it's simply everywhere

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,240
and yet thank goodness for that right

00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,240
because of last year

00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,520
we were i felt like we were living in an

00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,800
alternate dimension

00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,320
didn't it um and for the beginning of

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,039
that pandemic i still remember i know

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,280
many people

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,880
felt this way that it felt like we were

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,000
like suddenly like

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,440
pausing and stopping in time with the

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,560
beginning of this pandemic everything

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,759
was shutting down

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,000
the streets were eerily quiet the

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,039
airport was a ghost town

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,039
and many of us i will admit um you know

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,840
resorted to binge watching

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,280
just to somehow have some familiarity

00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,000
over relating to

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,320
what was once their society of of you

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,240
know

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,320
connecting and meeting coffee shops and

00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,479
going out to restaurants

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,039
and to you know find some sense of

00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:44,320
meaning in all the craziness that was

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:46,639
20 20. uh that is of course

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,840
binge watching between all the online

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,840
meetings many of us

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,120
i know have been doing all morning all

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,400
day all night long

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,720
or over walking our dogs yes i'm guilty

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,160
and baking all the things when we've

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,479
over stocked on things like

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,479
flour and toilet paper and top ramen

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,680
the world has changed really truly

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,520
forever

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,360
so while we're starting to come up and

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,000
out from this pandemic

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,720
uh it has definitely left an indelible

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,600
mark

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,440
on the world um a little over a year and

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,199
a half ago the pandemic

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,440
part of the pandemic we were thinking

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,120
about you know trade wars and tariffs

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,960
who were talking about the effects of

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,080
macro economic pressures

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,240
and geopolitical challenges and yet now

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,120
looking back in this year and a half of

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,560
a pandemic

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,000
it was felt kind of small compared to

00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,960
what we've been through

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,840
and really truly has touched everything

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,880
that we do

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,240
in every part of the world many

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,560
companies weren't really

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,280
prepared for their rapid really rapid

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,240
shift

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,280
everyone had to move to that was imposed

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,919
by the pandemic

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,759
shutting so much down i'm sure you all

00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,520
remember what it must have felt like or

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,520
when where you were at the very

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,199
beginning of the pandemic for me i was

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,199
actually at the very beginning of a

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,759
massive

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,280
move for my family just by sheer

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,080
coincidence

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,599
and that i will never forget and these

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,120
are memories that are forever burnt in

00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:17,919
your brain

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,599
strangely in tech while things felt like

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,319
we paused for a bit

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,800
recruiting really did not slow in fact

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,720
it was

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,000
super competitive right in the middle of

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,800
pandemic to get

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,599
really great technical talent i suspect

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,319
a lot of that was the incredible demand

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,280
um for people who understood how to work

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,759
in the cloud as

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,599
so many businesses suddenly had to shift

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,639
what they were doing in person

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,479
to a cloud workload um and

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,639
you think about it that it was to help

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,400
ensure that we were now in a touchless

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,080
environment that was accessible by our

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,800
peers and colleagues who we needed to

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,800
collaborate with

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,039
so there are some industries that were

00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,520
just well prepared

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,240
and really well oriented for this really

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,680
weird

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,560
year and a half that we've had with

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,360
pandemic and if i look back on it

00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,759
telehealth telehealth i barely thought

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,400
about

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,039
right i might have used it once in a

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,879
year

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,240
at most where you you know call your

00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,160
doctor they call you back and that

00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,759
canada's telehealth well telehealth

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,400
really came a long way last year it

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,039
included video in many cases and that

00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,440
was the

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,520
default that was the default that many

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,800
of us had to go to so i had many

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,400
telehealth appointments either for

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,360
myself or from my children or my husband

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,200
and gaming gaming thank goodness for

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,640
gaming thank goodness for my old company

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,599
that i use for

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,080
used to work for roblox because there

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,479
helped

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,480
there that this rope this roblox

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,880
community's other gaming platforms

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,600
helped us to have that social fabric

00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,320
that we so

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,720
deeply desire to have in person it gave

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,120
us an

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,839
entertainment entertainment platform to

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,640
connect with our friends and family

00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,920
uh in an entertaining way and to have

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,160
these shared experiences in these

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,640
virtual worlds

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,160
uh interestingly enough at the very

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,519
beginning of the pandemic the thing that

00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,480
was highlighted the most was actually

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,839
the moocs

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,000
so these massive open online

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,360
courses that were offered were slated

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,720
for near death

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,880
at the beginning of the pandemic just

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,120
before it hit and yet that was

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,080
one of the things that skyrocketed out

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,240
of control and

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,640
you know was just scaling back up it was

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,399
resuscitated because of the pandemic

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,279
clearly because there was a deep desire

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:34,320
by many of us who wanted to reskill

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,240
and be able to afford the opportunity of

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,760
the virtual work environment that us

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,800
those of us who are fortunate to be in

00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,440
tech had

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,000
uh at the very beginning and then of

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,880
course

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,680
we all shifted our shopping practices to

00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,839
online

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,720
and digital and amazon obviously was one

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,360
of the

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,080
the biggest companies that profited from

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,320
this

00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,640
uh experience and i know i had multiple

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,680
boxes of amazon deliveries

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,320
every single week if not every day as we

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,360
were

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,440
not going out and not shopping in person

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,200
but they were prepared and so these are

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,200
some of the examples of

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,200
industries and scenarios in which that

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,160
scale up happened immediately and was

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,279
able to

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:19,839
were able to really uh support this rise

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,839
and need during the pandemic

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,079
so now we're in this almost normal

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,560
year where many of us have gone

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,800
vaccinated and numbers are coming down

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,480
but the truth is things will never be

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,519
truly back to normal

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,360
as they were in pre-pandemic days the

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:41,279
future work is going to remain

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,279
hybrid for a variety of reasons

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,839
and in fact you know while we were

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,920
having we were having early signs of

00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,600
hope last year at the end of last year

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,839
many companies were surveying their

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,600
employees to understand their needs and

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,040
desires of coming back

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,920
to a real office workspace and to help

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,360
inform them

00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,600
of that return to real world work but

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,519
the reality is you know some surveys

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,240
have shown that 58

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,800
of workers will want to be working from

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,680
home

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,040
eight or more days each month and that

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,880
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,160
of all meetings will actually include

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,279
participants

00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,760
somewhere joining from home and

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,200
you know it's i'm sure not a surprise

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,600
that 77

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,360
of really large organizations are

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,000
increasing that work flexibility

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,480
especially

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,720
for those who are global companies and

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,959
shrinking some of their office sizes

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,640
recognizing the deep desire for so many

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:42,959
employees to continue with that

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:46,160
flexibility to work from home

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:48,720
and you know one interesting area

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,320
in the middle of the pandemic was uh

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,880
seeing that some software teams

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,920
who are so used to that in-person

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,519
component of

00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,360
code reviews and looking over a

00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,360
colleague's shoulder to help out with

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,920
some coding and reviews

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,800
um it was hard to do in the middle of

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,800
the pandemic

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,560
that's the way that you operated with

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,200
your pull requests and your code reviews

00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,680
and and

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,320
and pairing together on your insights

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,440
for

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,680
you know how to how to build things but

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,279
you know fortunately with all of the

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,000
plug-ins and integrations that are

00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,040
available

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,519
the the messaging tools

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,440
the version control tools across the

00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,399
board that were so

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,959
widely available in sas already it

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,519
really

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,279
required just a little bit of glue in

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,560
between to make sure that there was a

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:38,000
fabric there to

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,800
help create that conversation and keep

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,480
the effect of that conversation through

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,200
the code that's cited through the pull

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,079
request

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,880
that's put in and so interesting uh

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,720
experiences

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,600
cropped up that were actually pretty

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,360
pandemic but i'm sure had a ton of lift

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,880
and adoptions an open source project

00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,120
called code stream

00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,639
actually creates that flow between these

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,839
tools and streamlines it

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,440
so that as you're messaging someone and

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,360
asking for a code review

00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,959
you can organize the code review with

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,600
your teammates and then

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,720
document seamlessly the conversation

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,320
that's happening

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,000
so that you have that preserved

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,160
institutional knowledge

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,040
as you're working through and encoding

00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,519
and

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,480
building your applications so there was

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,519
actually a true

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,200
benefit and shifting all of this

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,800
online because that virtual

00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,000
collaboration really captured and

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,839
documenting

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,839
documented all of these things that

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,519
would otherwise be just between two

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,839
people and you would lose

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,279
that transparency and the color and

00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,880
context of those changes

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,720
but now it's there because it was

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,720
forcibly required

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:45,680
in this new virtual world that we've all

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,680
been operating in

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,880
and cloud engineering has really

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,079
significantly accelerated in fact it was

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,120
front and center

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:57,360
in the middle of uh the pandemic

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,639
and it had was a growing practice prior

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,360
to that but really

00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,480
um having the this discipline instance

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,320
during the pandemic

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:08,320
was was huge in terms of really shifting

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,560
some of the ways that we're actually

00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,000
organized and working together between

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:16,880
application developers and operations

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,760
so to support remote work um this

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,880
dramatic need

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,160
really caused businesses to scramble and

00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,560
you know in that early part of the

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,680
pandemic they were looking to enable

00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,760
their entire team

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,360
to do their work whether it was the ops

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,000
team and the infrastructure that they

00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,560
were managing

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,120
or the app developers needing to work

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,480
together

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,160
and deploy their code so you know

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,240
of course the focus was minimizing as

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,560
much as that on-prem scenario

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,560
and the touching in the environment on

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,240
an on-prem situation

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,560
and really enabling that collaboration

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,839
from a really virtual perspective

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:54,480
so in 2022 idc expects that over 90

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,920
of enterprises worldwide will be relying

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,440
on a mix of on-prem

00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:00,399
dedicated private clouds and multi-cloud

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,199
environments

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,399
uh to meet those infrastructure needs

00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,199
not well beyond

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,199
this pandemic

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,120
so we i introduced the concept of cloud

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,480
engineer but what do i what do i really

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,360
mean by this thing called

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,680
cloud engineering and it shouldn't mean

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,240
devops 2.0 which to some degree was

00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,480
really

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,160
developers throwing things over the wall

00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,800
to ops and ops still having to

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,959
to manage things from there but cloud

00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:28,240
engineering truly in this new net world

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,959
that we've had to work in

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,720
in this virtual collaboration is really

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,279
the application of software develop

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,079
development

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,839
across all of these teams and all of

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,639
these motions from app development all

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,839
the way through

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,839
the infrastructure component

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,839
it also means that we need to

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,440
fundamentally

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:52,320
integrate these teams as one and that

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,800
we need to find the common language to

00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,199
speak

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,360
across what app developers really need

00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,160
and how infrastructure and all people

00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,480
really need

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,199
to work so all of these three areas of

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,920
infrastructure

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,360
sras and aptv really need to be one

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,519
unified system to

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,120
to be optimized and working particularly

00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,320
in this new hybrid environment will

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,320
continue to work in

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,079
so this hybrid multi-cloud app-centric

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,720
infrastructure

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:21,120
it was trending prior to the pandemic

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,519
it's

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,040
certainly on the rise now uh post

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,959
pandemic

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,399
and you know really you know

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,040
understanding that

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,240
you you need to be able to have some

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,399
consistency

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,079
in how you manage in mixed mode where

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,519
you are likely going to have

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,519
uh on-prem as well as cloud

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,839
and being able to go in between those

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,160
two modes in a seamless and secure and

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:49,199
performant way

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,759
a quick stat for you in 2024 50

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,480
of network operations teams will be

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,880
required

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,759
to re-architect their network buying

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,839
stock due to

00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,759
the impact of hybrid networking which

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,720
will significantly increase about 20

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,000
percent

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:06,480
uh and so there's just a huge

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,319
growth and trend around this multi-cloud

00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,640
and app-centric and hybrid world that we

00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,640
live in

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,799
and again going back to that this

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,240
concept of cloud engineering

00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,240
you should really think about cloud

00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,880
engineering as a practice for future

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,640
proofing

00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:25,199
what you do today it often makes sense

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,959
for particularly small startups and

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,559
small projects to start in the cloud is

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,960
the most cost effective

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,559
way to get going because you don't have

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,080
to you know build anything on-prem you

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,720
don't have to think about the ongoing

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,080
cost

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,160
of owning hardware yourself but you know

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,640
as your business picks up and grows and

00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,640
has

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,080
much more complex needs around

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,760
international presence

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,200
you know required to scale having

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,120
geo-specific needs

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,480
you may need to really prepare for that

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:55,039
mixed model of both cloud and on-prem

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,400
or perhaps you did start on-prem from

00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,400
way back one and you need

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,240
the flexibility of being able to do

00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,400
multi-cloud as well

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,919
having that optionality and that

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,640
flexibility to do that is super

00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,840
important

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,520
but as developers and as cloud engineers

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,080
specifically in that practice

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,600
we need to think about that as early as

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,760
possible and for those who are starting

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,360
new projects that means from day one

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,440
of that project because you don't want

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,200
to end up wasting time in the middle of

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,440
peak such as the pandemic

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,360
having to re-architect things to fit

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,640
that scale and need

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,840
and we'll talk a little bit about some

00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,840
scenarios around that

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,760
so we've seen some businesses that were

00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,280
really set up

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,480
for success and the ones that use

00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,080
informative infrastructure as code

00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,080
to deploy the infrastructure had the

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,000
best setup because they could quickly

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,799
pivot between public private

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,200
cloud and on-premise deployments so what

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:53,280
is this infrastructure is code thing

00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,960
it's really using machine readable

00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,120
definition files for managing

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,039
provisioning data centers and cloud

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:02,080
deployments instead of using

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,760
physical hardware configuration this was

00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,679
especially important last year

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,280
when teams needed to reduce high-touch

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,440
environment interactions

00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,840
great open source examples of this are

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,760
terraform and polonie

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,840
so let's look at an example where

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,640
infrastructure as code was used

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,440
to help higher education the oscillation

00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,760
between

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,200
on-site particularly remote and fully

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,000
remote education has created a

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,320
particularly

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,760
challenging scenario for colleges and

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,400
universities and i'd say also high

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,679
schools

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,440
and middle schools and let's say we have

00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,960
this university that needs to go fully

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,799
remote learning

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,799
they have already used automation to

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,559
expand the scale as far as they could

00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,400
with their on-prem resources now they

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,559
need to move some of those workloads

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,000
to public cloud to scale their offerings

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,760
virtually

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,760
you know the university infrastructure

00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,760
as code solution like terraform

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,760
like terraform to automate the

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,559
deployment of their applications

00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,280
both on-prem with intersight kubernetes

00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,440
service

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,120
and in public cloud so they can easily

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,400
customize their automation to shift the

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,960
workloads

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,360
and here i asked a colleague of mine to

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:11,600
do a quick screencast recording for

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,600
kareem to walk you through this example

00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,919
as we move to cloud environment whether

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,840
that's private or public cloud

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:19,280
we are predominantly dealing with api

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,559
driven infrastructure

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,559
which means we can treat our

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,640
infrastructure as code

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,480
what i'm about to show you is how easy

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,280
it is when treating your infrastructure

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,520
as code

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,320
to deploy and configure a kubernetes

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,120
cluster

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,440
in aws using terraform a couple of key

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,799
components before we get started

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,840
first of all versions this terraform

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,640
file essentially defines the providers

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,880
that are needed

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:51,360
for us to deploy that kubernetes cluster

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:54,480
next is our defining our eks

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:57,679
cluster itself and this is where we

00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,960
give our cluster a name we

00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:03,679
go in and look at the different

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,440
worker groups and the desired capacity

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,080
for each in this case we have two worker

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,280
groups

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:13,679
one with three capacity and one with uh

00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,799
two capacity next is our vpc and this is

00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,360
where we define

00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,400
our underlying network for our

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,720
kubernetes

00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,840
cluster in this case we're defining our

00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,600
private subnets

00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,760
our public subnets and what we're going

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,679
to leverage from a networking underlay

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,960
security group is next and this is where

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,120
we're basically saying

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,159
this traffic is allowed to come in on

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,360
port 22

00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,080
on this ip address or this ip range and

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,720
or out

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,080
on these ports right so allowing that

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:42,799
security

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,400
group management for it to be deployed

00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,559
in aws

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,919
and finally defining our actual

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:51,200
kubernetes cluster

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:54,080
what is it going to be called and

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,640
basically putting it all together okay

00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,039
so

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,880
now that we have this we have all the

00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,360
puzzle pieces let's all let's put it

00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,039
together

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,039
so we're going to initialize this to

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,720
make sure that we have all of our

00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,640
libraries in place before we get to

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,480
deploy so we're going to type in

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,480
terraform init

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,120
let's make sure makes sure that we have

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,360
all the dependencies

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,120
uh ready all the providers are ready and

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,159
then let's look at our plan

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,880
so terraform plan this is essentially

00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,320
gonna

00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,080
give us the plan that we're gonna ex

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,919
we're about to execute just gives you an

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,840
idea of what the end points are

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,440
what we've defined essentially in our

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,799
entire different pieces that we've

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,960
covered

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:37,679
and then let's initialize this all right

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,679
let's run this

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:46,880
apply and just like that

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,120
it's going to go out build out my

00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,120
kubernetes cluster based on what i've

00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,880
defined and it's going to take a couple

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:57,360
minutes and we'll come back and see it

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,960
and just like that we have a kubernetes

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,280
cluster which we can leverage

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,880
to essentially containerize our

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,760
application and deploy our application

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,720
in cloud

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,200
let's look at what we have first of all

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,400
let's

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:13,840
have let's update our cubeconfig file

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,840
with the latest instance here

00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,679
and let's go ahead and look at

00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,840
what we've created

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,720
so these are the notes that were created

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,360
and let's look at everything under we're

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,600
leveraging

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:36,960
cubectl here to to talk to the instance

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,600
in aws

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,360
and just like that we will have all of

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,039
the information here is my cluster ip i

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,240
can start accessing that cluster

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,240
i can start containerizing my

00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:50,159
application and deploy my application

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:52,880
in cloud thank you for joining me and

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,480
thanks to kareem on that

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,320
so we talked a little bit about

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,520
infrastructure as code i'd encourage you

00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,720
to explore this

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,559
some more because this is really part of

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,080
the modern world of application

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:07,200
development in a hybrid

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,200
cloud scenario

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,400
so 2011 i'm sure many of you remember

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,720
this catch phrase which was

00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,600
software is eating the world and this is

00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,320
where

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,200
businesses of all kinds became software

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,279
companies

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:27,520
and in fact even banks like back in 2011

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:29,039
the fact that banks were also publishing

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,640
apis and becoming software

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,279
companies was a huge feat an incredible

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,679
shift

00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,640
and change and how we looked at software

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,760
and who offers

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,440
software and who offers apis

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,600
and uh you know this quote from mark

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,520
andreessen is phenomenal which is

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,880
you know amazon i still remember those

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,880
days when amazon was just

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,159
selling books and then they expanded to

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,799
sell other things

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,919
and then they expanded to become a cloud

00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,520
provider

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,440
exposing some of the servers that they

00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,559
were depending on for their own

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,400
retail business and so you know all of

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:05,039
this was happening alongside

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,120
you know comparing borders which was a

00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,919
book company that also was selling books

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,919
online

00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,240
and was you know thrashing the throes of

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,559
bankruptcy as amazon was accelerating

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,320
and reinventing itself so software was

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,559
really truly eating the world in this

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,559
case

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:24,080
and yet now the catchphrase um and the

00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,000
you know even prior to the pandemic is

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,240
really that software

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,200
uh that somewhere eating the world now

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,760
ai

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,200
is eating software that sounds a little

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:37,120
scary so this was a

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,880
uh a title uh by a forbes

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,400
uh author who wrote an article around

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,960
this and

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,640
you know really ai you know was framing

00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,640
up in terms of adoption

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,640
in terms of number of jobs that were out

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,200
there in the demand around that

00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,120
and that actually accelerated quite a

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,880
bit in the middle of the pandemic for a

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,720
variety of reasons

00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,000
and you know one of those scenarios in

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,640
which ai has pic

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,799
is picking up in terms of adoption is in

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,880
our own coding as developers

00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,640
and so there's a very popular tool that

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,440
maybe some of you some of you are using

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,520
called tab

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:14,080
9 and that is using ai that it trained

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,919
on over two million files from public

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,400
repos in github

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,200
across multiple programming languages so

00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,520
it's trained

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,440
to learn these complex behaviors and

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,799
then is able to use that deep learning

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,919
to ought to suggest

00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:29,520
time saving code completions i mean i

00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,120
did code completions with those dev

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,480
tools that microsoft way back when but

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,279
those were really simple

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,760
code completions this is like a massive

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,880
amount

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,000
of repetitive code that can actually be

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,159
used to save you

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,640
a ton of time as you're building your

00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,640
solution

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,360
and you know the whole concept of ai can

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,919
seem

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:54,159
scary especially if like me you watch

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:57,360
way too many sci-fi flicks

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,679
i get it i can completely relate um

00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,120
and while ai can help with sort of this

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,039
repetitive coding

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,720
humans really are still necessary to

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:07,600
solve really complex

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,600
coding challenges and as technologists

00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,760
really we need to also ensure

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,159
that we don't inherently train our ai

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,080
with our human biases right

00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,080
and so there's a significant really

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,200
significant social responsibility we all

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,520
need to think about

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,120
as technologists and that we need to

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,320
take account for especially when ai's

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,640
applied to areas

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,600
like criminal justice i'm sure many of

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,919
you have seen

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,799
some of the erroneous identification of

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,080
people

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,760
using ai in the news while we were all

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,960
sheltered in place during the pandemic

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,399
so these are the things that

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,520
technologists we should really take the

00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,200
hardest part of our social

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,440
responsibility ensuring

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,320
we don't inherently train ai with those

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,320
kinds of biases

00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:50,720
ai is everywhere an ai is certainly

00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,159
everywhere at cisco

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,480
and i'll just walk you through just a

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,360
couple of these uh four scenarios that

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,399
we have here

00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,360
on the screen um and mine weld which is

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,399
such a geeky

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:04,799
cute name i love it it's a technology um

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:06,559
that we use to support conversational ai

00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,080
uh we developed this python based

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,159
machine learning framework

00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,000
um and teams across cisco use mindmold

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:13,840
for a variety of

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,159
natural language applications such as

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,799
chat bots interactive voice response

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,320
systems

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:22,720
and automated faq answering as you know

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,840
it's a not a fun thing to always be

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,399
doing so

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,760
uh and as well as search so we have

00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,000
applied this in products like

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,679
webex and we also use it for our

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,640
internal and external

00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,960
web portals we also use machine learning

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,720
to define and apply security policy in a

00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,960
multi-cloud environment

00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,720
so whether it's on-prem or in the cloud

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,679
these compute instances could be

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,640
virtual machines bare metal servers or

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,960
containers

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,799
uses machine learning behavior analysis

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,799
algorithm algorithmic approaches to

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:54,799
offer a holistic workload

00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,559
protection strategy so this allows

00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,679
customers to proactively identify

00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,799
security

00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,559
incidences using behavioral analysis and

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,919
reduction of attack surface by

00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,960
identifying software-related

00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,559
vulnerabilities

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,559
so there's a couple of examples that are

00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,520
on here i welcome you to explore that

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:13,840
more

00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,840
post presentation

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
and here's an example of how we actually

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,960
applied

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,679
ai some of our ai technology in a real

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,960
world

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:26,080
scenario so we have a customer

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,799
innovation project

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,880
that we worked on and we used our meraki

00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,720
cameras to learn and understand traffic

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,320
behaviors in a complex intersection in

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,919
sydney australia

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,520
love sydney australia used to travel

00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,200
there all the time a great place to

00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,120
visit and i'm missing it right now in

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,520
the middle of the pandemic

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,200
um but this it's using and collecting

00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,320
learning from large volumes of real

00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,720
world data

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,320
through the cameras and always ai was

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,559
able to identify high-risk

00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,360
scenarios and intervention opportunities

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:57,919
which can reduce that traffic congestion

00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,640
prevent accidents and literally save

00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,799
lives

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,799
so that's that's a huge opportunity in

00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,480
terms of leveraging something like ai

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,399
and again you know the adoption and

00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,520
usage of this is going to continue to

00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,440
take up which means

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,120
lots of great opportunities for you as

00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,880
developers if you're not already

00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,600
learning ai i'd encourage you to explore

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,600
that more as well

00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:24,720
and i'm sure i don't really need to

00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:28,159
talk about this much this is in the news

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,480
almost every day right cyber security

00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,440
is a threat every day for us and that

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,240
has picked up

00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,600
enormously during the pandemic uh i'll

00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,279
share some of these stats with you

00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:42,480
i mean 358 uptick in malware

00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:45,039
just in 2020 alone is massive

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,640
uh google registered 27 increase in

00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,559
phishing sites

00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,399
and new organizations become victim of

00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,399
ransomware every 10 seconds

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:53,760
especially small to mid-sized

00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,320
organizations it's not just the same as

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,559
ones

00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,080
there are often these these issues that

00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,519
happen on a daily basis that we don't

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,000
even hear of in the news because they're

00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,399
not

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,039
these big famous companies or issues

00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:06,080
that are

00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:08,240
nationwide and as a reminder of that

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,640
not too long ago here in the us we had

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:13,760
this cyber security threat uh

00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:15,120
with the colonial pipeline only a few

00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,799
weeks ago

00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:21,840
and it caused a significant gas shortage

00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:23,039
in the u.s northeast area and with panic

00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,760
buying it became

00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:27,840
that much worse and this hack was

00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:30,880
speculated to have been related

00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,559
to open security gaps were more

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,320
remote working scenarios that we're all

00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,840
living through while most of us are

00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:38,559
living through right now

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,880
and in fact this remote work this past

00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:44,720
year we have seen a significant rise

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:47,360
in security threats globally 76

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,559
on average according to some reports so

00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,720
it truly lands with us

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,679
as developers to contain this it's in

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,799
our power

00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:58,559
to help ensure that data systems are

00:31:54,799 --> 00:32:00,559
secure and yet i know how many

00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,600
of you are feeling about this it isn't a

00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,360
simple ask

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,360
to incorporate security in everything

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,159
you do you have to consider where data

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,159
lives

00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,440
what specific country names you have

00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,559
state regulations

00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,679
compliance data sensitivity and on and

00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,480
on and on

00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,200
it really it shouldn't feel like paying

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,600
a tax

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,679
every time you have to do this it really

00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,640
means to be seamlessly part of the work

00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,640
that we do every day

00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,080
and you know we're making progress and

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,360
there are things that are on the horizon

00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,679
that aren't too far out

00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,679
that we hope to accelerate and ensure

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:36,480
that security becomes a first-class

00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,679
citizen and

00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:42,000
all the work that we do so while it

00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:44,799
seems like a bit of a burden secure now

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,519
there is a rise in security specific

00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:48,559
solutions

00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:51,039
and practices we can today identify

00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,840
exploitations and code at run time and

00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,720
collaborate

00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:57,120
on quick resolutions developers have an

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,919
opportunity as part of their ci cd

00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,919
practice to use ai for source code and

00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,720
binary scanning to detect

00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:07,360
risky software and app developers will

00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,440
be able to integrate tools in their ides

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,679
where you're living and coding every day

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,039
to secure your in-house and third-party

00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,919
api integrations

00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:17,039
as well as you know on the horizon to

00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,279
proactively

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,080
get security guidance while you're

00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:25,600
coding

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:28,880
in place so that hopefully near future

00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,279
and you know i hope that you i shared

00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,960
some

00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,640
good learnings and trends here for you

00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,760
to consider as you're thinking about

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,279
your careers as

00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:37,440
developers things that you're going to

00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:40,320
be working on on the horizon

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,760
but if you remember nothing else in this

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,080
i want you to take a few things from

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,799
what

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,559
from this which is our work is going to

00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:49,200
stay hybrid hybrid

00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,559
is here to stay if you aren't already

00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,000
starting to think about applying

00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,320
software best practices

00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,480
across your infrastructure management

00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,880
you should do that now

00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,559
ai is part of the future of coding and

00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,000
if that is also here just saying

00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,200
something for you to really consider if

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,559
you're not already

00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:09,520
uh familiarizing yourself with ai

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:11,599
and last but not least foremost don't

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,919
forget about your responsibility

00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,599
when it comes to cyber security risk and

00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:17,839
ensuring that we're all operating

00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,200
in a safe secure world virtually and

00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:22,720
beyond

00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:26,720
and with that thank you for having me

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,720
and i'll open up for a q a

00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:32,159
yeah thanks a lot grace for this uh very

00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,119
inspirational

00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:36,639
uh it's inspiring keynote um i think

00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,040
there were some some really

00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,560
uh really good thoughts about what we

00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,800
all uh

00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,240
uh all experienced in the last uh last

00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,480
one and a half years

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,359
um yeah let's see if there's some some

00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,879
questions uh

00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:54,240
from the audience so you said um

00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:57,440
that i will replace or will

00:34:54,240 --> 00:35:00,079
at least somehow

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,720
affect how we how we're going to uh code

00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,839
right

00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,960
um you made the example of auto

00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,880
completion um

00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,560
for instance and finding bugs do you

00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:12,240
think it will um

00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:15,359
like stay uh mostly as a supporting

00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,160
uh feature or uh can can you also

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:19,280
envision

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:22,880
a world in which uh the computer

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,880
basically programs itself completely

00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:30,720
so i i i really do believe that

00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:32,480
ai during auto completion of code

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,800
that that will take on more and more

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,520
workloads over time but for true

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,119
innovations and truly complex problems

00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,280
human intervention really needs to be

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,760
there so a great example of that is

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,280
really ensuring that we're not

00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:46,079
inherently programming that bias that

00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,640
really requires

00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,400
a human person to evaluate you know how

00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,119
is this actually operating what are the

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,960
you know

00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:56,240
inherent challenges with how this is

00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:59,599
actually automating its learning and um

00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:02,240
how it's uh actually systematically

00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,280
profiling uh the results of something

00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,640
whether it's a person

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,079
and a criminal analysis or whether it's

00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,760
you know some other scenario like the

00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,359
traffic analysis

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,960
it's not always gonna be perfect it's

00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,800
going to get better and better but it's

00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,880
really going to require a pair of human

00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,040
eyes and evaluation to ensure

00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,720
that we're always using the safest

00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:24,960
procedures possible and we apply

00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:28,240
technology yeah thank you

00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,400
so um this question um

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,880
what are your predictions for the future

00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,800
of data science

00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:37,440
ah what are my predictions for the

00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,560
future of data science

00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,920
that's a tough one i think there's so

00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,640
much uh greenfield opportunity in data

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,040
science

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:51,200
in general right now and um it's such a

00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,839
growing discipline in general which i

00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,359
look at is separate from what we do as

00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:58,800
application and cloud

00:36:55,359 --> 00:37:01,119
developers uh feature for data science

00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,480
i hope becomes less complex for people

00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,880
to adopt and learn

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,599
and for data science practice just like

00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,480
the

00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:10,480
the operational piece of cloud

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,000
engineering becomes an integrated

00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,920
integrated and woven part of the

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,800
business whether it's with application

00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,440
developers

00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,440
or the the business leaders and managers

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,119
who want the data analysis

00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,359
that needs to be a much more seamless

00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,720
piece of the puzzle

00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:26,640
so i think we have a ways to go when it

00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,880
comes to data science and how

00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,640
that the tools are done how the analysis

00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,240
is done and how the practice is run so

00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:35,200
that it's much more

00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:37,200
woven as a everyday piece of the work

00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:40,400
that we do and as a seamless part of

00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,400
the team environment as well

00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:48,079
thank you oh there's one more question

00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:52,079
um how can developers better

00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,079
mitigate security risks in their code

00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,200
how can developers better so there are

00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,520
the ways that

00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,200
you can do that now is mostly run

00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,160
time-based using

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,760
tooling right to identify those those uh

00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:08,079
risk factors

00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,079
um

00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,400
and the future should be really you know

00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,240
again going back to

00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,480
it shouldn't feel like a tax having

00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,000
integrations with them the ide whatever

00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,440
flavor of ide that

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,839
you use such that it becomes this

00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,040
helper tool in places you're coding

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,920
identifying

00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,720
the risk issues while you are coding

00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,720
versus

00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,960
after the fact it's great that we have

00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:35,040
tools now to identify

00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,240
risky software or ski libraries that you

00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,640
might be including

00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,839
but that's often sort so far down the

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,920
line that it's

00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:43,680
harder to undo what you did the earlier

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,359
that you can identify

00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:47,520
the issues as you're coding as part of

00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:48,960
the practice the better off you will be

00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,320
i think we're still working on getting

00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,960
there but we certainly at least have

00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,520
tools

00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,880
cisco has a bunch of tools as well that

00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,800
help you identify

00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:00,079
some of these issues at runtime mode and

00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,000
deployment mode

00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,440
one more question um what is the

00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,640
importance of open source

00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:09,119
um you you made with the example of

00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,880
github so what's the important of open

00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:14,960
source for the

00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:17,680
ability to build ai code tools ah

00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,680
so there are a ton of solutions and

00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,839
tools and libraries that are being

00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:25,440
contributed in an open source manner

00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:26,160
which is a fantastic and as a community

00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,400
driven

00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,599
thing which it helps to really

00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,800
accelerate innovation

00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:34,800
a big big fan of open source um

00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,560
and they're in you know where i said we

00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,839
all have a social responsibility every

00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,760
time we contribute

00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:41,520
to libraries like that every time we

00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,160
look and leverage

00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,520
these solutions we always need to take

00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,040
the approach of being

00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,040
a responsible technologist and

00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:50,640
understanding what is what is this

00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,079
really giving me how is this really

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,640
operating making sure like i said

00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,640
earlier

00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,560
that we aren't inherently putting in

00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,320
biases that will operate against

00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:02,320
you know certain you know factions of

00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,320
society and and different cultures

00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:08,400
yeah plus i guess it's also a good uh uh

00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,000
learning set for for for all these ia

00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,480
algorithms right

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,599
absolutely it's a great learning

00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,640
opportunity all the code that's

00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,720
contributed and

00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,800
open source request stories like github

00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:21,839
and gitlab and the bucket

00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,680
and all the things yeah hopefully it

00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:26,480
makes the right inferences from from all

00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:29,920
that code outside out there

00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:32,880
um yeah i don't see any more questions

00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,280
um now so yeah thanks again for your for

00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:35,200
your

00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,720
amazing keynote for answering all the

00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:53,839
questions that we had

00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:53,839
it's a pleasure

00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,000
