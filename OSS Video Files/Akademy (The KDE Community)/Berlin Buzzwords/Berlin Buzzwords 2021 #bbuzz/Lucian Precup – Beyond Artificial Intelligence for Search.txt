Title: Lucian Precup – Beyond Artificial Intelligence for Search
Publication date: 2021-06-24
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2021 #bbuzz
Description: 
	It is proven that for relatively well-structured data, like in e-commerce for example, a hand tailored search configuration can easily outperform machine learning approaches for relevance. The search configuration considers the different searchable fields, a business taxonomy and ontology, some domain related synonyms, a few specific landing pages, boosts and some business numerical criteria.

In the same way, we describe an approach for relevance in the case of large-scale search engines which is not based on classical "PageRank" and machine learning approaches. We propose a model based on social interactions between communities and individuals that are using or configuring the search engine. We then compare this model with machine learning powered approaches.

hello berlin buzzwords thanks for the

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,759
great introduction

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,559
and uh thank you for for organizing this

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,320
conference so

00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:20,320
so well for the second time in in

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,080
virtually thanks for bringing the

00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,640
community together again

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,279
and i hope to just to see you in person

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,800
sometime

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,800
soon so uh you expect to talk about

00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,640
artificial intelligence in this talk it

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,920
would be quick because we'd only have

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,760
five minutes

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:41,600
so first what is ai is machine learning

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,559
ai is this cubic polynomial regression

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,399
ai

00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,239
some might say that this linear

00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,239
regression is a i

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:52,640
or maybe is powerpoint ai

00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,480
well um let's go to search engines

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,879
because yeah this is what we do

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,079
all search engines work in a similar way

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,480
they perform

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,320
three basic tasks they examine the

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,640
content they have permission to see

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,720
that's the crawling they examine each

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,760
piece

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,600
of of content that's indexing

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,119
and they decide which content is more

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,320
useful to the searchers

00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:19,280
that's ranking um

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,880
well when it comes to ranking this is

00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,000
where we plug the

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,720
all the ai stuff there and yeah

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,240
everybody says that this ranking is our

00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,720
secret sauce it's

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,799
top secret uh you have a lot of

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,079
buzzwords there you have ai powered

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,000
search you have a

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,000
neural source you have machine learning

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,479
deep learning data science

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,240
well something that trey granger's uh

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,640
trade ranger used to call

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,759
buzzword salad okay no offense buzzwords

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,119
but yeah

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,280
this is what it is um let's take this

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,479
from another perspective from the

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,560
perspective of a

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,600
business user of a search engine

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,040
administrator

00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,200
we actually helped we built and we

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,399
helped building a lot of e-commerce uh

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,200
search search engines and

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,640
we came to a conclusion when it comes to

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,959
relevance uh

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,400
you have if you have an option between a

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,920
fine relevance tuning

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:19,200
and automatic automated relevance tuning

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,840
well when you talk about e-commerce data

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,599
which is

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,360
highly structured you have a lot of

00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,680
tools at your disposal you have boost

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,520
you

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,120
have function scores you have synonyms

00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,920
you have redirections you have courier

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,640
writing

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,120
you can work on user experience you can

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,280
plug

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,800
business rules or business needs in

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,760
there

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,800
how about learning to rank uh so yeah ai

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,720
machine learning

00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,160
you have the ranking model you have the

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,760
learning algorithm and you have the

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,239
training data

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,879
but actually our conclusion is that this

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,800
is very expensive to implement properly

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,560
you have you need a lot of maintenance

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,000
there and you have a lot of technical

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,480
depth

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,440
and if your model is not properly

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,560
trained that's

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:03,920
worth and

00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,400
last but not least you have a black box

00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,879
there

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,760
and you cannot explain easily explain to

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,239
the business

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,599
why do you have this result why this

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,599
first and this

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:19,200
this this one second um

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:21,040
yes um so yeah what what do do others do

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,800
so you certainly have heard about both

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,000
which is google's

00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,040
new ai algorithm that that that powers

00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,560
google

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,440
well actually board helps only 10 one

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,640
in 10 searches nine out of ten searches

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,840
do not use board

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,280
do not need board do not need ai

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:45,599
um of course ten percent it's a lot

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:48,959
but yeah you have to have the

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,000
time and the money to optimize this 10

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:53,280
percent there

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,879
it's only 10 percent you also have in

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,599
the e-commerce space algolia that

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,680
released a new ai platform

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,319
when you look into it actually besides

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,640
nlp and llu which i do not discuss here

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,799
we'll see later uh it resumes to dynamic

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:09,920
synonyms personalization and

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,480
bring your own ai okay so plug your own

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,640
model

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,000
and hope for the best it's actually

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,040
amazon that understood this

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,919
better uh they created this mechanical

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,680
turk

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:25,680
which is a an automaton uh

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:29,600
which is a human-powered

00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,639
robot actually yes so

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:36,320
don't get us wrong we do

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:39,600
use ai and we do think ai

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,320
is useful but we mostly use it in these

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,759
parts crawling and indexing so you can

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,759
use it for

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,840
it's it fits for automatic document

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,080
classification from document clustering

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,840
for dynamic synonym suggestion

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,759
for data cleaning because if you have

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,960
garbage in you have garbage out so yeah

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,680
everything which is the

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,560
noise in the data like like ocr for

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,320
example

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:05,039
uh machine learning is fits

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,039
well to to clean that of course

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,120
everything that's around nlp and

00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,800
you in a natural language like a voice

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,240
search chat bots

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:18,000
question answering yeah ai fits best and

00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:22,639
also to some extent in ranking when you

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:26,479
deal with highly unstructured data

00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,240
now if we see how the current models

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:32,880
work

00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:36,479
um so uh this one is from google

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:40,720
it's powered by advertising a lot

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:43,120
by seo money to some extent a lot also

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,160
uh you have some ai there in the

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,120
questions part

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,759
uh so uh you cannot see it well but if

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,199
if you

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,280
go to this url you you will see that

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,240
it's also powered by compliance that

00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,400
means that

00:05:54,240 --> 00:06:00,880
if you comply to the rules imposed by

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,600
by google then you will get to the first

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,440
page

00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,440
and it has a lot of personalization

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,240
probably if you go to this page you will

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,919
have some

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:13,039
different display than than i

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:15,199
i have and in e-commerce

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,639
this one is for amazon from amazon you

00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,880
kind of have the same thing

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,960
you have advertising to some extent you

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,360
have partnerships that appear on the

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,360
first

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,199
first page are not boosted you have

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,600
compliance those that

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,319
comply with the rules of the marketplace

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,800
and they have

00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:34,400
they are well noted and all that you

00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:37,440
have also personalization

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:41,120
now if we go to something new

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,000
that's beyond artificial intelligence we

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,039
kind of

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,240
observed that social networks have a

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,880
quite interesting model so of course you

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,120
have to

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,520
some some kind of ai there because in

00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,039
your twitter feed in your youtube field

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,800
you have some data that's displayed

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,479
there for a reason

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,840
so yeah you have maybe some machine

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,000
learning you have some advertising of

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:05,360
course

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,240
but especially you have content

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:13,759
that's there because people you follow

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,840
find find find that interesting

00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,919
you also have some content that comes

00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,479
from people around you

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,560
but mainly uh your relevance model is

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,960
influenced by the people you follow

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,720
and this brings us to what we have tried

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,520
to implement

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,319
in our collaborative search engine that

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,520
you can find at

00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:36,479
all that site which is

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,599
it kind of brings all these together so

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,479
yeah all

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,599
have that you have seen um you get

00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,560
results that should

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,120
just as you have you get in google they

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,720
are

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,039
powered by the community so actually

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,199
the people you follow are the search

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,440
engine administrators

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,879
and just like you see them in your

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,199
twitter feed

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,919
you will see them in your search results

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,639
so it's some kind of a

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,160
mechanical turk if i may say powered by

00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,199
the people you follow

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:13,520
and by domain experts and yeah by

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:16,560
by people that you trust

00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,919
so this is it i hope i wasn't too
