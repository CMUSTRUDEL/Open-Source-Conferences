Title: Marcus Eagan – The maintainability of open source code 20 years from today
Publication date: 2021-06-30
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2021 #bbuzz
Description: 
	To commemorate 20 years since Doug Cutting open sourced Lucene and donated it to Apache, I want to talk about ways everyone can pitch in to ensure the long term viability of the open source project. Someone looking at replication code for the first time in 20 years, might really understand the behavior of something like master-slave. Even though we understand it today, the onus is on the contributors and maintainers to constantly add more clarity to a project. Landing such a complex PR can be tricky and usually involves multiple people. Here's how I did it, and here are a few other areas where I have been focused to improve the long-term viability of the code base.

	00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,920
this

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:16,160
is uh an exciting time because i

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:19,439
i don't think that we had

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:23,439
too many open source projects that were

00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:26,880
use case specific that have lived on

00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:32,480
and continued to grow in adoption

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:36,000
over time over a 20-year time span so

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:39,760
i'll tell you now about me

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:45,039
so my name is marcus egan

00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:47,039
uh i work at mongodb as a

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,719
senior product manager of atlas search

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:52,640
which is

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:55,920
actually leucine under the hood we

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,160
and some fancy syntactic sugar

00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,680
on top and some management capabilities

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,800
it runs in the cloud

00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,400
but uh before that i worked at

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,840
lucitworks

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:11,040
and before you know just for

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:16,560
many years i have been hacking on

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:20,799
lucine solar inelastic search

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:24,320
i'm i'm fascinated by it and why i care

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:27,360
is really about uh

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,759
you know there's not everybody can

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,439
afford

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,960
to pay for an expensive proprietary

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:40,479
search engine

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,479
and you know these technologies are free

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,880
you can you know you can see the code

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,920
too so that's also nice so you can

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,759
understand

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,240
and i think that it's just really

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,360
important for our world

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,960
to have free

00:01:53,360 --> 00:02:00,799
open source software available

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:04,079
so you can innovate quickly and build

00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,640
uh new products and and

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,239
companies but especially search because

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,239
that's how you find things

00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,879
so i'm going to talk about i'm not going

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:16,000
to talk any more about myself really

00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:17,520
there's a few other slides but later

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,599
i'm going to talk about the lucine

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,599
history that i know about

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:27,280
and also

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:30,959
the goals of to maintain improve

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,959
and extend uh

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,640
an open source project so that it

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,720
survives

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,239
so i think a lot of people here know

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,160
about doug cutting

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,599
uh doug cutting was

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,519
you know he's been interested in search

00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:50,080
and working on search since

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:53,760
the year i was born 1989 and

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:57,519
he saw search as being the simplest

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,280
access pattern uh for people getting

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,920
the information they're looking for like

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:06,800
he was thinking about search before

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,400
the web and he

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,959
this picture that you see here is

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,080
actually i think that's the hadoop

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,800
stuffed animal so you have worked on a

00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,480
lot you probably have some exposure to

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:23,680
many of his projects in your life

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:27,040
so he he wrote two search engines at

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:30,159
xerox park he wrote one

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,680
at apple uh v twin engine is still in

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,000
mac os

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,599
10 i believe someone can correct me if

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,799
that's not accurate

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:42,239
and he worked on another one

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:45,360
at excite now

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,319
lucine was his fifth search engine

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,319
and uh

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:55,200
he i i read a comment about how he goes

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,239
to an app like many applications today

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,640
and he's like i wonder if they're

00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:59,760
running

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:03,200
lucine uh they probably are so

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,280
this is a paper that sort of like the

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,280
the theoretical underpinnings if you

00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,360
will of search

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,200
so i it i think it's an interesting

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,120
paper for everyone to read

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:15,280
it's just an object-oriented

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,799
architecture for text retrieval but

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:22,639
this is like published early 90s maybe

00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,639
91 uh so

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,800
i'm here talking about you know 20 years

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,440
of lucine

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,280
in the future this is 10 years prior to

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,680
lucine he was writing about

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,120
these things thinking through them and

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,919
and working on them

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,120
with you know various colleagues this

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:43,120
looks like

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:47,120
xerox park so close to my old house and

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,639
this uh this is like a lineage of this

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,360
is like a little timeline

00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,759
of the early days of apache scene which

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,919
are

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,520
really interesting and could be a book

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,639
or a movie

00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:02,800
so lucine joins apache jakarta

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:05,199
but it was initially on sourceforge but

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,080
doug and his benevolence they donated to

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,880
a past

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,520
jakarta which was really an important

00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,240
moment

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,000
for the project i feel because

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,039
corporations today

00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,919
i mean they recognize the apache brand

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,600
for sure

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:24,639
uh they know that they that

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,440
companies can build reliably on it and

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,720
they know that

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,919
they can trust it's going to have the

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,280
scrutiny uh and the commitment of

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,240
several

00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,440
other companies it's like a

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,600
self-fulfilling privacy is

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,800
you trust the project because you have

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
people working on it so now you're

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,360
working on it and

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,520
sometimes companies have to deal with

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,919
bugs that aren't necessarily

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,880
their problem but this is a part of the

00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,960
overall project

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,160
then in 2010 something else really

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,800
interesting happened

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,880
which you know to my limited knowledge

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,759
is sort of unprecedented but also very

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,960
important

00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:02,160
apache and lucine i mean apache lucine

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,199
and apache solar merge so solar is like

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,520
uh

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:08,479
the easiest way to describe it is well

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,479
there's an acronym

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,840
it is but really is an http library

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,120
for for leucine it's like and and some

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,240
replication

00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:24,160
uh but it's uh

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,919
was very common to use lucine prior to

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,319
solar and then build all this plumbing

00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,720
to

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,720
connect with it so it was a little

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,400
inaccessible for some people

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,280
uh but solar made it simpler gave you a

00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,960
server

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,759
and that came out in 2007

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,759
out of cnet

00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,840
when they merged everybody working on

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,280
lucine was also now working on solar and

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,479
everybody working on solar was not

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,759
working on the scene

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:57,039
so he got uh like a lot of power

00:06:53,759 --> 00:07:00,639
uh and that collaboration

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:05,520
and that went on for about

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,520
or i guess 11 years uh

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,880
and this year

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,560
they started last year in the email list

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,840
there was discussion about if if they

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,479
should split

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,080
all the committers had a vote i think

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,160
they needed a quorum maybe i don't know

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,280
if everyone voted but most people did

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:27,120
and apache lucene

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:29,599
basically agreed to split from solar

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,639
which i thought was interesting i had my

00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:35,440
own opinions

00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:38,080
on the matter um i'm a big fan of both

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,199
but they are fundamentally different

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,880
projects

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,520
and so it made sense because

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,039
every time you made a change and won

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,720
that change was also

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:54,879
forced into the other even if it wasn't

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,720
necessarily the right path so

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,960
that was a big deal but i still think

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,160
it's the early days i i think

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,120
you know 20 years from today uh there's

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,000
going to be

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,400
a lot different about the project and

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,800
i'll

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,800
share some of that in in a bit here

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,960
so and this is just like my

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,759
standard apache lucien slide which is

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,599
just like doug

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:24,879
donated it uh

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,520
but the the the key thing that i wanted

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,720
to

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:31,759
to point out the two ideas is that

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,399
like this is where a lot of academic

00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,680
research

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,640
actually gets exposed to the commercial

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,120
world or

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,000
like uh the civilian public or like the

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,440
non-researching

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,240
public i mean it it's amazing there's

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,040
there's some academics who are

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,040
committers

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,160
or or contributors to the project and i

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,480
think that they

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,800
they help facilitate that but it's also

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,160
just the cutting edge and

00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:01,200
this project has surfaced several bugs

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,440
in java which i think uh oobe

00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,640
schindler a committer in germany just

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,760
spoke to

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,279
uh and i think it's because it pushes

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,399
the limits of scale

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:15,760
now this is what maintenance is like

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:17,200
uh in in solar and lucine and open

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,399
source in general i mean everybody's

00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,120
going in their own direction

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,320
they don't follow commands then you have

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,640
jira i i

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,760
this is the newest addition to the this

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,800
presentation

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,160
uh because i i i saw this one of my

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,800
colleagues

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,519
sent this over and i i love it this is

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,880
so true

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:40,000
and apache hail zera like if

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,320
he closed one zero another two will open

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,360
uh and this is important part of the

00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,320
process

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,560
and and and maintaining you know and

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,600
like facilitating success in open source

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,920
is like

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,519
before you open the jira for the lucine

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,360
project or the solar project

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,640
they say start with the mailing list

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,519
because i mean

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,200
there's we're already we have so many

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,040
jurors in those projects

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,560
so start with the mailing list kind of

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,839
validate if

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,880
it's uh worthy of further investigation

00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,880
and then we'll if if it

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,880
passes that gate then if it gets through

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,079
that gate then you can open a jira

00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,959
because we don't want

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,519
more jiras and i think in the early days

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,720
the

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,040
the email list was vital and i've

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,120
read you can a lot of it's public i've

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,560
read a lot of these early

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,760
conversations uh and doug was really

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,399
helping a lot of people get up and

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,560
running with uh

00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,680
with lucine so that i think that's also

00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,279
really cool

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,600
uh it's like 20 years i don't know if

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,839
he's still answering questions but he's

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,040
like leveled up so many other people

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,120
that

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,640
you know i think he can if he wanted to

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,839
he could step back i think he's doing

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,360
other things probably now

00:10:53,839 --> 00:11:01,279
probably writing the next search engine

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:05,440
and then is this other issue which is

00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:08,560
uh with maintenance is like

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,519
what makes sense to us today won't

00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,600
necessarily

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:16,560
make sense to a new

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,440
group or new generation of engineers

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,880
working on the

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:24,560
project in the future okay and so

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,880
the ietf they they recommended that we

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,279
stop

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,279
using like slave to describe

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:32,480
relationships between

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:36,560
servers and a distributed system

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,360
and so many projects that are starting

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,480
up today

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,800
and books and and

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,880
lessons and courses and tutorials

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,720
they're not going to be talking about

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,640
masters and slaves which to me didn't

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,600
make sense in the beginning

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,360
but again you know it was a technical

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,680
term it is a technical term

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,480
an archaic technical term but you know

00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,480
languages

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:02,720
evolve and and strive to improve

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,320
uh and so an important part of the

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,360
maintenance is making sure

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,120
that people who come in with this new

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,040
frame of reference can look at the code

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,639
and understand what's going on

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:17,839
uh and and so that's what this

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,839
uh this

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,480
pull request was about it it says remove

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,680
oppressive language but it's really

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:29,040
about clarity that and

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:31,200
then there's another another

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,079
important aspect of open source which i

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,720
think

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,639
you know it is it's of arguable

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,839
importance to some but again it's

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,519
it's about uh the frame of reference

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:45,680
that newcomers have

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:49,040
and i really like a project when i see

00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,320
a a red failed is it like the build

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,040
failed because that means they're doing

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,000
something

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,560
you know like maybe not all the branches

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,720
say

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,839
failed but if there's one that's failing

00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,519
it's like they're on the cutting edge

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,600
they are breaking stuff

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,360
and so that's exciting even if it's

00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,720
passing i'm good with it

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,920
i just want to know i land on a project

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,519
they have continuous integration

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,120
uh infrastructure to support it

00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,480
someone's donated it in the case of

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,360
apache apache provides the

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,519
infrastructure

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:22,959
but i think this is it is an overlooked

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,920
um item for for many projects and it's

00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,839
it's important

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,440
some projects are too complex to do this

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,760
too i recognize that i

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,040
i've looked into this in a couple areas

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,160
but i think that

00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,200
the build badge is is helpful

00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,079
and also should it links to the the

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,199
projects

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,639
ci so if you want to see you know how

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,680
some of these things are set up that's

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,279
also

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:51,040
pretty helpful so

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:53,040
this one i think we added in 2019.

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,399
so another important part of the

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,079
maintenance is the project health

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,199
continually monitoring it

00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,639
and so this is uh i think mike

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,399
mccandless

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,839
put together these graphs there's a ton

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,120
of them uh

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,920
and it's just the analyzer performance

00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,120
over time you can see corresponding to

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,040
commits

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,279
uh and and and merges like what

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,880
what is the performance delta uh for

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:22,800
some of the benchmarks that

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,800
have been running for years uh

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,399
and then on the improvement side i'm

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,720
gonna try to fly through

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,519
my time time numbers now on the

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,959
improvement side the the principal goal

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:38,720
of an engineer is

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:42,000
to simplify uh and i have heard this

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:45,360
time and time again from eric hatcher

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,600
who i mean he he's the author co-author

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,399
of lucine in action which is

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,000
still the most widely read book on

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,600
lucine i recommend it for everyone he

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,839
also co-founded lucifer's

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,240
and he's a brother from another mother

00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:01,040
so you know he's helped me so much

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,800
and thinking about what my role is or

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,880
what one's role

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:07,440
can be in an open source project and i

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,880
think that it's really important

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,440
for lucine and many other projects out

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,560
there

00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,720
to know i mean to to

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,920
encourage people to help in the ways

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,160
that they can

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,160
because there's a lot to do always and

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,720
it's not always about features

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,199
uh it's sometimes just about a step up a

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,160
little

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:30,320
a marginal improvement uh or removing

00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:34,000
technical debt

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,800
uh and so like one of those improvements

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
that

00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,759
that i have been just tasking myself

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,079
with like no one else has asked me to do

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,800
this

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,720
i just i want to do this because i care

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,920
immensely about the project

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:51,600
uh i mean i am also employed because

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:55,680
i care about the project but it's like

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:59,519
what i noticed that there are some

00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,279
challenges to the security uh or like

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,800
people's perception of the security of

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:06,000
these projects

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,959
of solar and lucine and so

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,440
i try to to beat that back every chance

00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:15,120
i get whenever i run into something

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,720
that is like that doesn't make sense or

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,639
you know somebody's red team is going to

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:22,160
flag this or whatever or

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:24,800
someone who doesn't who is confused will

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,240
will complain about it or this does pose

00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,600
a real issue

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,279
and so you know just have to step in

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,000
and and work through it and i don't

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:37,120
always know how to fix things but

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,040
uh i've had a lot of help i

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,639
like for this one i think i got a lot of

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,839
help from

00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,160
jan hoydel these both of these and this

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:46,480
one

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,079
adding the security manager got help

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,480
from robert muir

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,920
and this one i get help from houston

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,279
putman and these people all work at

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,399
different places and they're all over

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:56,240
the world so

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,680
like we all but we all have to pitch in

00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,519
and

00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,880
that's just a really important part

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:05,439
about open source is like do not

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,439
we cannot allow our software to be less

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,400
secure we're more secure because we're

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,120
open

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,600
uh and you know i've filed bugs in the

00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,240
past

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:16,160
i i've had to deal with incident

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,480
response to

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:23,520
for solar and so uh yeah i think this is

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,520
this is really important

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:32,080
and like we want to improve the

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:35,120
the relevancy right so uh we have to

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:38,160
to go to the next level uh which is

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:40,559
you know for some use cases approximate

00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,480
nearest vector search and this i think

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,440
mike sokolov

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,080
wrote this and and he's partnered with a

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,280
bunch of people

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,000
and amazon and elsewhere and

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,840
i think this is just really a testament

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,600
to the power of open source like

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,880
all these companies all these people are

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,640
working on this they have different

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,760
needs and they're investing

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,559
and it's it's going to be available to

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,960
everyone

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,320
and i'm pretty sure it'll be more robust

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,679
and more available

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:12,880
than any proprietary option out there

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:17,360
because it's hard to

00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:19,200
to stop the collaborative power

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,559
of all these people in open source so i

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,120
think it's real

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,840
having the vector search is just a

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:29,120
testament to that

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:31,120
and the next big thing is an interesting

00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,120
project which i i think that'll be a

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,240
part of my book if i ever write a book

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,520
on this uh

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:40,080
community there's like while

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,679
the vector search is so that's landed

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,000
that's in maine people are working on it

00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,559
there's still

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,960
some things to work out and this is not

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,320
this is 9.0 so it's not released yet

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,720
there's also the reference

00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,440
implementation of solar which

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,360
aims to remove a lot of bottlenecks some

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,760
of the limitations of the distributed

00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:02,799
design um probably on the query side and

00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,360
indexing and especially testing there's

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:07,440
a lot of flaky tests in solar

00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,559
mark miller is introducing lots of speed

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,160
ups and he's working

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:15,840
with some of his colleagues at apple and

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,559
some people not at apple like ishan and

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,760
noble

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,559
to to bring this to the world uh the

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,960
solar world

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,160
and these are happening in parallel and

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,200
vector search

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,559
and the reference implementation so this

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,039
is uh really exciting stuff

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,559
i recommend that you you know check out

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,679
this ticket when you

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,559
get a chance uh there's a lot of comedy

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,760
i won't

00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:42,559
leave it up for too long but uh

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,200
i think that this is just another

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,960
testament

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,840
to you know all the collaborative

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,960
power that goes into open source and all

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,160
the

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,400
companies investing in it

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,280
and the policeman i think the policeman

00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,960
is

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,039
i'm not sure maybe it's automated but

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,360
it's somebody i think it's uva

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,240
and these are these are some of the

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,600
tickets that

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,840
are available so if you want to pitch in

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,720
and try to help with these

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,520
they're all in that ticket so you can go

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,600
ahead

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:20,640
uh this is clara's spirit

00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:23,679
now this is uh

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,280
what i when i was rental time so when i

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,679
was going through this i

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,320
was trying to get through that first

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,600
portion

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,240
in 20 minutes but this is probably the

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,440
most

00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,760
important part of this talk which is

00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,840
like

00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,600
the special thank yous and these thank

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:43,280
yous are

00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,919
are really to people who

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,280
have through their direct actions or

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,280
indirect actions or

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:54,880
collaborative spirit uh

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:58,240
have have made this project

00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,640
so robust so nina and playing schwartz

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:04,080
put on the conference yanexili donated

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,440
solar to apache he could have asked cnet

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,320
if he could spin it out

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,760
and to a proprietary project that no one

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,840
could ever see then it probably

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,159
never would be as important or

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,960
ubiquitous as it is today and elastic i

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,559
think

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:21,520
that you know they

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:23,679
built a pretty big company only on open

00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:27,120
source for a while you know they

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:29,919
uh a pretty wide reach and and

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,360
so i i'm grateful to them i don't know

00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,080
all of them but i do know a couple of

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:35,679
them so i

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,679
shouted them out um

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,480
and then these are so eric hatcher and

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,600
charlie monger

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:46,000
they've been they've been helping me

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,559
on such a deep level just like i mean i

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,840
went from zero to 100 real quick

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:54,799
and or 99 and i learned i learned

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,480
every day from from eric he's a wizard

00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:00,480
mike sokolove mccandless

00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:02,080
they work at amazon and

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,840
you know people use that's one of the

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,320
most widely used search engines

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,080
in the world uh and they're pushing the

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,440
boundaries and their team i think greg

00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:12,480
miller

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:15,039
i've seen some really awesome stuff come

00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,559
out of that team recently

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:21,919
uh and

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:23,919
jan hoylo oh tim potter eric erickson

00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,240
so they used to work with me at lucio

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,320
works but and i think eric is retired

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,480
and he's still working on

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,919
lucine and solar from time to time just

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:35,520
volunteering

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:37,919
uh and his commitment to open source and

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,720
just you know kind of helping me a

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,799
little bit when i was

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,559
first getting going has been really

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:45,679
helpful he

00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:48,720
knows a lot about this about search

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,600
and tim potter's yeah i mean he's also a

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,400
wizard

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,799
and jan hoydo and robert muir i mean you

00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,520
can

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,799
look and see what they've added to the

00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:00,559
product so much

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:04,880
mike mike drove kevin risden

00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:09,760
noble paul tomas eduardo fernandez loeb

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:11,760
ishan uh

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,200
i don't i don't want to mispronounce it

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,520
but he helps me

00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,559
a lot too still today all these people

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,360
tomas helped me

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:21,440
with the back porting of uh removing the

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:25,840
oppressive language which really

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:29,120
is is helpful that it's inclusive but

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:32,720
i mean i care more about it being uh

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:35,360
maintainable and reliable uh ultimately

00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,760
uh but it also does matter that it you

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,039
know

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,520
we shouldn't be calling server slaves in

00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:42,559
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,919
so uh and then these are other people

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,880
it's just like there's a bunch of people

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,919
out there that

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,159
that help this project and so

00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:52,480
i think we should recognize these people

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:55,520
and open source more outwardly like

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,080
like like for example jaron glover he

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,679
was a devops engineer early devops

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,799
engineer at a

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,799
fintech company in my neighborhood but

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:07,840
he's like encouraging me he's like

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,360
please fix this please fix that uh

00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,880
and he's like checking in he's like let

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,240
me see the pr

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,039
like may you know let's work on on this

00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,279
stuff

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,559
uh let's dig into this and so i think

00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,520
having those people in the background

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,480
are important

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,799
uh david smiley is also that way i mean

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,720
he

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,880
is another wizard he could belong in the

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:30,000
wizard column on the previous side

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,559
too he uh really pushing the boundaries

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,960
of

00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,240
what's possible at salesforce and he is

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,960
a uh

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,760
a frequent contributor uh to and

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,320
committed to

00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,480
solar and lucine joel bernstein i worked

00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,960
with him at lucy works he taught me

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,400
some wizardry uh he knows a lot houston

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,600
pup putman

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,840
uh he has

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,760
pushed the boundaries too so he was

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,159
working on a kubernetes operator

00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,360
i was trying to do away with zookeeper

00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,559
just as a test

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,760
and so our pass collided on that i think

00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:05,200
a few years ago

00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:08,640
around etsy d and kube but yeah he's

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,320
great and then aaliyah abbott was like

00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,679
at lucifer works putting on all the

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,919
conferences and and like

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,960
really fostering an environment for

00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,159
developers

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,919
to work and

00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,320
and i think that was really important

00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,240
like the lucine revolution conference

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,600
was a a little more important than

00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,679
people knew and

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,720
physical activate now is a little more

00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,279
important than people

00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,039
might recognize today but it's hard to

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,039
get a bunch of

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:37,039
people strongly minded strongly

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,400
opinionated engineers together to talk

00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:42,480
about code

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:45,120
uh and then will hayes he's

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,320
he like recruit he recruited me to loose

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,480
it works uh which was

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,840
a blessing because i love search and i

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,559
love open source and

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,360
i finally got to devote a lot more time

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:57,039
to

00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:59,520
to solar and and the vex tree ram was

00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,279
like he's kind of like jaron but also

00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,279
was my boss just like in my ear

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,880
about doing certain things and and

00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:08,240
prioritizing things

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:11,440
uh and he's the cmo

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:14,000
at lucy works and then

00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,880
cord and grandma joanne so these are

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,919
like the

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,400
my mentors of life accord campbell

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,320
he is like shake trees go into the solar

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,880
community and shake more trees

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,400
uh or any community and so that's what

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,960
that's what i'm committed to doing is

00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,080
like

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,640
shaking trees uh trying to

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,840
get an apple that's ripe to drop and

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,360
there's no apple

00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:40,320
riper than apache lucine right now

00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,159
uh to me because it's search is the most

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,760
common access pattern

00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:47,919
uh to data to information in the world

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,000
you don't type in a domain these days

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,640
you type in a search query

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,600
you don't always you know a database is

00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,880
for

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:58,000
uh a databases for

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,080
when you know exactly what you're

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,799
looking for and

00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,520
a search engine is for when you're open

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:08,480
to recommendations

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,799
have an open mind have an open source

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:14,720
search engine

00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:16,480
thank you uh lauren shepherd she asks

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,919
what would you recommend for people who

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,600
want to start contributing to lucien

00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,159
yeah that's a good question

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:27,440
um if you want to start contributing to

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:30,080
lucine i would say start using lucine

00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,880
that's number like that that's the the

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,000
easiest

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:36,159
way that's how that's certainly how

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,919
i got interested in it and involved in

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,200
is like trying to use it

00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:43,440
um and then

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,480
once you start using it then start

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,440
building it

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,000
and then once you start building it uh

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,000
then start

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,520
customizing it and then once you start

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,720
customizing you land on something

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,880
good then you maybe make a proposal or

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,799
once you start using it you'll run into

00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,679
an issue or once you start building it

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:03,360
you'll run into an

00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:07,520
issue and then you can open a pr

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:10,080
like and i'm i typically like

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,039
i'm running solar at all times like in

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:14,960
my house

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:17,200
uh and now i'm starting to run lucine on

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,880
my work laptop

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:23,520
a lot and i just i'm looking

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,320
in a particular in a very focused area

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:29,600
most of the time like

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:32,000
and so or a couple areas but

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,720
i think i think that's that's a good way

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,799
to focus

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,200
it's too much to take on all at once you

00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,200
know so

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:46,640
okay so start start focused and and

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:49,120
play around with it use it yeah use it

00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,799
and then build it some people go to

00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,840
start start building it first

00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:55,360
from source rather but because i mean

00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,360
you're already using it right like if

00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,640
you're on wikipedia you're using it

00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,480
if you're if you're searching on amazon

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,720
ever you're using it if you're calling

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,559
an

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:13,840
uber you're using it like it's all

00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:13,840
around you

00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,399
