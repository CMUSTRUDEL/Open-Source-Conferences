Title: Andrea Griffiths – The new OSS community: Enabling for advocates not customers
Publication date: 2021-06-30
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2021 #bbuzz
Description: 
	Built and maintained by people like you, open source software powers the global economy. Sustainability of this ecosystem is pivotal to accelerate human progress; yet many organizations focus their community building efforts as a sales pipeline, or a program to deflect requests for support. 
In this talk I’d share tools to engage your communities in a positive, nurturing way; with a servants approach to building community and centered on creating advocacy, loyalty, and ultimately business value.

software

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,960
super fan of experimentation of testing

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,759
things

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,840
figuring out what works what doesn't

00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,759
experimentation is 100

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:43,200
my jam so i'm excited to talk to you

00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:45,759
about some um ideas i've been

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,119
supposed noodling and applying to my own

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,159
practices

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:54,720
um this matters to me why well i

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,960
am 100 the product of community

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,119
um if it wasn't for open source software

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,880
if it wasn't for the opportunities that

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,040
being part of vibrant

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,240
open source software communities have

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,159
provided me

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,479
i wouldn't have the pleasure of being

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,720
here today with you so

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,840
it is important to me and i'm super

00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,319
excited

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,680
to talk to you about two things that i'm

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,720
super passionate about

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,360
um two specific topics one

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,680
of course the power of open source and

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,560
open source communities which fuel

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,680
everything the global economy the way we

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,360
work

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:35,040
companies like this one so that's one

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,239
and second of course the undeniable

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,319
value that a

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:43,360
very well-structured well-thought-out

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,360
nurturing community program and how it

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,879
can exponentially improve

00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:52,080
not only the quality of your product

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:55,200
but also your user experience but

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,680
before we get started into this little

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,840
journey i want to share something with

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,480
you i hope my german there is okay

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,000
this is important um i want to share

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,000
with you a realization that

00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,120
it's truly changed the way that i've

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,360
worked

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,640
it took me many many years i won't age

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,040
myself

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:15,440
but um i want to share it with you and

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,120
all of you in the audience so perhaps

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,000
you don't have to wait as long as i did

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,680
to figure this

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,519
out so just keep in mind

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,239
throughout this conversation and

00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,159
throughout the days ahead that

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,519
every single person in the audience

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:35,840
watching this or watching a replay

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:38,319
you have the power you are empowered

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,000
at your company regardless of your role

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:43,040
whether you work on sales

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,080
or design or data science

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,959
or analytics whatever you do you have

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,159
the power

00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,360
to create meaningful interactions with

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:55,200
your users

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,640
to create spaces for them to share their

00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,239
experiences with you

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,680
this is not a you know solo job this is

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,959
not only a function of

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,280
devrel or user researches or

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,480
support community teams this is a

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,799
function that affects

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,599
every single one of you so regardless of

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,040
your role

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:17,199
keep in mind you can to be a disrupter

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,400
disruptors are people just like you and

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,079
me and

00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,720
we can all provide an opportunity to

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,840
empower

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,960
users to advocate for them to listen

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,400
to learn from them and of course

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,400
to give back to the open source

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,720
community for the better

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,000
so if you take nothing else today please

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,840
remember that

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,639
you are a disrupter so embrace that

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,479
all right so let's get started in

00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,520
colombia there is a saying

00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,520
um it's

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:54,479
and roughly translates to basically

00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,280
if you open up a shop if you own a shop

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,840
um

00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:00,080
you should look after it there is a

00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,880
humongous misconception out there

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,960
that all it takes for you to create

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,919
nurture grow a community that's going to

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,400
be productive

00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,520
and enhance your product and your users

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,960
experience

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,680
is doing just that creating a space

00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,120
slapping on a slack channel this score

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,000
discourse instance

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,240
whatever it is and people will just

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,080
flock to it they will just come

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,280
and that's not necessarily the case

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,720
we're going back to the

00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,560
tienda analogy um

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,720
you have to tend to it you have to

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:35,919
nurture it you have to

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,560
engage with empathy um building a

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:40,080
community

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,160
is as much about driving the success

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,759
of your business and the bottom line of

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,160
your company of course

00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,320
as much as it is promoting and enabling

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,560
your customers to be successful

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,919
at using your product at accomplishing

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,360
what they're trying to do when they

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:56,479
decided that

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,280
your product your feature your research

00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,880
paper

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,639
that's what they wanted to invest their

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,520
time in so

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,240
keep that in mind this is true both for

00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,120
users

00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,840
of products as well as members of the

00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,440
open source

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:14,800
community and whether it be maintainers

00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:18,479
or contributors you have to tend to your

00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,479
garden so if you can attend

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:25,039
and how do we do that so

00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,080
the reality of it is that in the advent

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,960
of covet

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,400
um we've been forced to work a bit

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,560
differently now

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,479
the way that we engage our communities

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,160
via open source communities or our

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,880
communities of customers

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,199
it's not the same and it shouldn't be we

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,960
we

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:46,080
can um count on in-person events

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,240
we can't count on those hotel-lovia

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,199
conference interactions that sometimes

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,240
spark the best

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,639
ideas no we have to adapt

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,400
we have to adapt to the now and we have

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,520
to adapt to the fact that

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,080
now more than ever every company has

00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,160
been forced to become a software company

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,800
so regardless of what business you are

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,360
in

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,680
um to survive this pandemic and the

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,440
constraints of it

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,919
you must have engaged into software

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:18,240
uh either creating a website or the way

00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,520
that you engage your customers etc even

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,479
something as simple as

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,280
selling your goods through a marketplace

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,800
online

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,280
this means you are now a software

00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,160
company doesn't matter if you sell

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,479
popsicles

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,360
or if you are creating the next big

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,000
software

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,240
tool for developers so what can we do we

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,560
can embrace this opportunity now

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,400
and with this challenge comes the

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,919
opportunity that we can now reach a

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,199
global audience

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:47,440
and provide spaces for collaboration

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,639
exponentially um we're now more

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,479
connected than ever

00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,400
we're now seeing folks that maybe did

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,759
not have the access and the know-how

00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,879
into technology

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,280
um learning right um i

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,520
am equally shocked and pleased and

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,199
surprised and also horrified at the fact

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,720
that my mother is now in every single

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,720
social media site

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,919
um and she actually knows how to use

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,720
them so

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,000
that did not happen before covet so we

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,080
need to adapt to it now

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,520
and meet our users and our customers

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,360
meet our community where

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,720
they are um to do this no better tools

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,240
than open source there's a

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,840
million projects full of very nice and

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,160
knowledgeable collaborators and

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,360
maintainers that can empower you to do

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,199
these things

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,919
whether it be collaboration tools

00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,159
whether it be streaming tools like obs

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,519
um there is a tool an open source that

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,479
you can lean into

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,919
to enhance the experience of your users

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,919
and your communities

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,200
and i understand that this is not for

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,360
everyone um

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,680
not all companies are supportive of

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,160
embracing open source practices

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,760
um we're slowly catching on but it's not

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,560
a perfect scenario

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,000
so you don't have to dig in full on you

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,279
can just kind of

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,480
dip your toes in the water so i want to

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:09,040
share with you um on this little link

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:13,040
here where it says um

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,440
for slash bb buzz bibi ucz1

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,560
it's a really interesting article

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,360
published by

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,399
github this research was done a couple

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,839
years ago

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:26,959
and it actually explains to you and

00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,120
hopefully your decision makers and

00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,480
the beauty that it is adopting open

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,800
source practices or

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,120
starting with inner source to work

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,920
better to engage community to grow to

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,839
scale to make your product better so

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,800
keep these things in mind we're going to

00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,360
adapt to the now

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,560
and adapt them to the now of course

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,440
includes

00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,080
harnessing that community power your

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,760
business

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:57,360
now you as a individual contributor

00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:00,080
as a freelancer as an engineer

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,600
and you have an incredible opportunity

00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,800
to deliver

00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,200
human authenticity even through a medium

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,760
like this a conference online

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,200
um you can bring that human touch to

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,920
your product

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,519
and you can help create that loyalty and

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,040
goodwill that is

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,480
so very easy to lose um and so hard to

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,480
really attain

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,480
so of course this is not something that

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,640
happens overnight you can't just

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,920
again open a shop and expect people to

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,440
flock to it

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,200
so i'm going to share with you a few

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,519
things that i've

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,040
done in the past that i've been able to

00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,240
empower communities

00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,440
to lean to harness that power and to

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,519
help improve the

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,959
way that they interact growth scale

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,120
their products so

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,120
let's take a look at what we can do to

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,160
get there

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,200
so let's focus first of all in

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,959
scaling and retention um

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,480
if you are in any kind of business

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,399
regardless of what it is

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,800
and you know that it costs a lot more to

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,360
acquire a new customer user community

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,680
member

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:06,399
contributor however you want to call

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,440
them a new human that comes to use your

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,760
product or

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,240
that wants to bet on you is harder to

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,880
acquire than it is to retain

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,959
so in order to retain our users to keep

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,200
our community members engaged

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,000
to keep those people who downloaded your

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,320
product

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,200
using it and we have to build a strong

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,399
culture

00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,760
and you very much can begin today to

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,120
start doing this

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,880
shifting culture and you can do that

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,200
and all of these things are going to

00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,760
lead into enabling for advocacy

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,519
and not so much for customers eventually

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,640
of course silver lining they will become

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,959
your customers

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,240
um but some of the ways that you can do

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,040
this include of course

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,360
listening is so important talk to

00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,120
maintainers talk to contributors

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,200
talk to the person that just installed

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,839
your application or just visited your

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,880
website or subscribe to your newsletter

00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:01,279
talk to them reach out

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,320
and then be quiet simply listen to their

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,399
experience

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,000
sometimes we are looking or working on a

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,160
product for so long that

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,320
we tend to lose sight about that user

00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,120
experience for a first-time user

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,800
or someone who is maybe not as technical

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,519
as you are or doesn't understand the

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,920
concepts

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,839
because they're not as you know together

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,440
in it as you have been

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,120
in order to do that and do it

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,160
effectively we need to do it with

00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,360
empathy

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,760
so don't make assumptions um go into

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,079
these conversations with an open mind

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,920
and keeping in mind that you're doing

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,079
this because you want to listen

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,760
and learn another thing that we can do

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:39,760
whether you are an individual or a

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,160
company is investing in research

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,800
and i don't mean hiring a contractor

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,480
which

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,560
anyways if you're a contractor in this

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,720
business fantastic we need you

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,760
um but it doesn't necessarily mean you

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,880
have to spend

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:55,519
thousands of dollars and resources into

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,200
doing user research something like

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,160
sending out a tweet asking a question

00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,959
now at your

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,279
product that's user research answering a

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,920
question on a community forum

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,959
like you have that community or stack

00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,560
overflow

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,680
or reddit or your own forum if you have

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,399
it

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,240
that's user research so leaning to these

00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,440
practices and encourage everyone in your

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,480
organization

00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,839
to also adopt them sometimes it's a bit

00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,000
of a hard sell

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,000
to get folks to get excited about doing

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,160
this type of extra

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,680
but i promise you when you give that

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,920
white glove treatment

00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,279
to your users when you focus on those

00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,040
customer stories

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,959
when you're inspired you build those

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,920
relationships you're going to be on the

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:42,800
right track to create some fierce fierce

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,800
loyal users

00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,040
and so what happens when we apply all of

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,560
these things well it's really exciting

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,120
because we are now

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,560
at the level of authenticity at a scale

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,120
and what does that mean

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,760
of course if i answer a question to you

00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,880
via

00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,079
a personal message um that might have

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,120
answered your question

00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:06,560
you now have the answer you need it if i

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:09,680
answer your question in a public forum

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,519
um now i help countless individuals who

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,760
might have the same questions so

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,680
keep that in mind that is a good way to

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,600
scale practices

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,079
when it comes to either updates to your

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,800
product or just use a research

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:24,240
figuring out what's working what's not

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,959
when you do these things

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,240
you focus on nurturing your users it's

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,279
authentic

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:34,560
you earn their loyalty and so you

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:36,000
and this user obsessed culture helps us

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,959
create user advocates

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,760
so what happens then um you have your

00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:41,680
users

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,120
and they love everything you're doing

00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,079
they love how responsive you are they

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,560
become your fans

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,760
they become your advocates and then

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,279
ultimately

00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,880
um the true north they become your user

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,760
advocates they become

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,440
the folks that are talking about your

00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,639
product they're sharing it on their

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,320
social channels

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,079
they're advocating to the decision

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,160
makers of their company

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,279
to purchase your goods to purchase your

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,040
platforms

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,320
because that is the product where they

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,360
feel they've been treated the most

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,120
authentically

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,399
and they're the most invested and this

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,120
is also true to

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,120
open source projects right so if there

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,800
is an open source project that you think

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,720
wow this could really improve our

00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,079
product or maybe we should try

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,760
and utilize it for i don't know scaling

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:29,120
our applications

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,600
invest in it with an authentic entry

00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,600
level

00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:36,480
and i guarantee eventually you will gain

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,839
that user advocacy and that you should

00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,639
obsess

00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:43,120
culture

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,240
here comes my heart one more time so we

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,720
remember

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,279
and of course doing all these things

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,639
sounds fantastic andrea i love that yeah

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,920
let's let's go for it

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,839
let's um become community people again

00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,800
this is everyone's job not just

00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,720
your devrel team or your support team

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,639
but it's a hard sell right

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,000
um so i wanna share a few pointers for

00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:09,120
you to

00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,160
enhance um the messaging

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:13,120
of value proposition for folks in your

00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,680
companies

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,079
or for your partners who might not be so

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,839
much into sold into this extra efforts

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,480
that come with community building

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,160
and nurturing so remember you have an

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,360
unique opportunity to

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,959
harness your users talents what does

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,399
that mean that means in your community

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,720
there are people that

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,440
maybe they are not equally expert on

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,519
your product

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,839
maybe they are even more expert in your

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,000
product than you are yourself

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,880
and they have infinite talent and

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,959
potential

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,720
and when you nurture those relationships

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,920
you're going to enhance the

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,800
overall customer experience so what does

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,639
that bring

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,920
to a value point of view for your

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,079
organization

00:16:53,920 --> 00:17:01,120
it brings a higher engagement it brings

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,959
um better feedback better actionable

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,559
feedback that you can then apply to your

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,120
products uh

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,039
that higher quality engagement is going

00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,520
to help your product grow

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,600
improve the overall customer experience

00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,240
so creating the spaces nurturing this

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,120
community

00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,160
is going to be a fantastic way to you

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,720
know support your

00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:22,880
users um and not just lean on to the

00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,079
traditional support paths

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,360
and there are many many um across

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:32,000
organizations that you have and

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,799
value add by being a community-minded

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,360
person

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,400
open source-minded person and what do i

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,720
mean by that

00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,760
this is the job of everyone and the

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,480
value proposition

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,200
affects everyone from sales and because

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,480
again

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,320
that can be a huge business

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,720
differentiator if i

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:51,039
am looking for a product where i'm a

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,440
gigantic company or a startup

00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,400
and i find a product of course this is a

00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,000
personal take

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,880
that has a really strong community

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,400
support or leans into an open source

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,960
project that has a fantastic welcoming

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,880
community i probably lean more towards

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,919
using that versus one

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,160
that is entirely business to business

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,919
why because i know if there is an issue

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,760
there will be more eyes than those of

00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,640
the developers who are developing the

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,200
product

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,360
so i know i can reach them directly and

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,320
provide feedback from my particular use

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,440
cases

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,919
so for sales you will sell more

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,080
for uses to sex of course less attrition

00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,600
sometimes we lose customers and users of

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,640
our products to things that are

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,840
so just elemental in a simple

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,000
email a simple message on a forum could

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,840
help us retain our customers so

00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,520
again it costs a lot more to get a new

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,799
one so let's invest in retaining the

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,480
ones that we have

00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:51,360
let's reduce that churn um and then for

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,840
product and product people like myself

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,720
what an incredible opportunity you have

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,160
to listen to your users gather that

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,960
feedback

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:03,200
and actually put it to action actually

00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,679
do the things that your users are asking

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,960
for

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,640
that doesn't mean you're going to take

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,559
every single suggestion from the

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,520
community and apply it to your product

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,080
of course

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,160
but this will really enhance the scope

00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,799
in which you're looking at your roadmap

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,360
and the decision-making process and when

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,640
you are

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,480
prioritizing so product

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,320
teams you're also winning with your

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,720
community in open source minded

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,679
and finally for marketing i mean this is

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,640
doing the job

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,440
of a thousand marker to fry um

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,480
watermelon

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,919
is the best advertisement and i

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,480
you know when you have a recommendation

00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,679
from a peer you take it maybe a bit more

00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,200
too hard than you would if it's

00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,400
something that you just found in a

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,160
random

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,960
google search so i want to talk to you a

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,679
little bit more

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,799
from the product perspective about

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,840
adoption

00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:56,640
and this is a very old debate goodie

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,360
and it's called um the pirate metric

00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,440
theory

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,120
it's called that because um if you spell

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,559
it phonetically it sounds

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,240
r well this was uh created by a

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,799
gentleman who's much smarter than i am

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,640
dave mcclure and basically he wanted to

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:14,400
focus the way that

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:17,280
young companies and startups were

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,200
just prioritizing their efforts figuring

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,000
out what metrics to look at when it came

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,000
to engagement

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,760
when it came to adoption when it came to

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,760
revenue and product

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,600
um i very much appreciate this as a

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,280
product person myself

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,200
and because it leans heavily on data and

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,640
when you lean on data the numbers don't

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,600
lie you're able to take a look at your

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,600
metrics for

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,120
awareness acquisition activation

00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,400
retention

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:44,960
referrals revenue and then you can take

00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,880
all of this quantitative data and apply

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,640
it to a way that would enhance the

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,520
experience of your users

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,880
or would increase your awareness will

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,919
help you retain

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,919
folks using your platform etc so

00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,080
please take a look at that even if you

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,159
are not a product person

00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,919
this is a really really good way to take

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,200
a look at what metrics matter and what

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,799
you should be looking at when you're

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,200
having these interactions

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,559
it helps you lean into those community

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,200
um opportunities

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,320
very well so there's a short link there

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,880
you have that code

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,520
forward slash pirate and actually the

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,320
folks

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,760
have way did a really cool youtube video

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,760
explaining

00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:28,000
these principles they are pirate metrics

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,679
and um i recommend you watch it so that

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,120
you can learn a bit more about

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:35,440
how to and what measuring matters when

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,960
it comes to community

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,039
okay and let's see again

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,200
cross organizational proposition i think

00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:46,240
i went forward let's go back

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,799
um we can also not forget about open

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,679
source

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:51,200
let's not forget about fostering that

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,240
obsession giving mark

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,159
back to the open source community um and

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,320
i like to think about it uh with

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:03,120
something that is called the

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:05,360
uh servant mind the serbian mindset

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,559
um you know a lot of companies talked

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,360
about

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:12,159
uh contributing to open source or

00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:14,799
sustainability of open source or

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:17,919
um helping open source projects and it's

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:21,120
very talked about it's very promoted

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,960
lots of buzzwords right um

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,240
but you need to really take a moment to

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,760
stop and conscientiously examine exactly

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,200
what you as an individual

00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,039
or your company uh what are you doing to

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,640
ensure the supportability of the

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,640
projects that your

00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,480
product is using or the ones that you're

00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,760
using yourself what are you doing are

00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,440
you contributing

00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,760
if you're not what's keeping you from

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,360
doing it um

00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,960
let's look at it from the servant's

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,000
point of view and

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,520
i love this definition because um it's

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,720
full of humility

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:57,200
it's full of empowerment uplifting

00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,080
servant leadership means that my

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,400
motivations was important to me

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,120
yes it matters but it's really not as

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,159
important

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,480
as the scale right so

00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,440
not just helping one person but helping

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,960
thousands

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,039
and the beauty of open source is that we

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,720
can all contribute we can all be part of

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:17,280
these wonderful communities

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,080
and we can all help each other get where

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,880
we need to go

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,080
so take a moment to reflect on what

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,720
you're doing

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,440
and i encourage everyone to get started

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,320
if they are not

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,520
and once we do a few of the things that

00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,520
i've mentioned

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,720
we're gonna hit a point where we start

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,799
thinking well

00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:39,039
am i doing this right does that mean now

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:42,240
that i have a successful community

00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:43,360
does that mean now that i am in a modern

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,919
community

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,520
and and one of the ways that you can

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,520
really evaluate this

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,320
of course the adoption of metrics

00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:56,320
fantastic you can take a look at

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:58,080
the arp theories and pick the evaluation

00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,159
metrics that matter to you that matter

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,799
to your organization

00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,960
but at a more high level really the

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:07,120
simplest way is to take a look at your

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,400
user success currency and what does that

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,440
mean

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,360
you know the currency of your users that

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,559
you have that you can gain is their

00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,120
trust

00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,240
when someone downloads your platform

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,279
your app

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:24,000
when someone contributes to your project

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:26,480
they are setting up their trust in you

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,520
and your abilities in your product

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:32,640
and that trust is absolutely

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:35,279
priceless currency if you have

00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,400
uh increased engagement if you have lots

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,880
of adoption

00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,000
that means you have trust so hey success

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,360
currency

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,360
user love of course yes i am telling all

00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,440
my friends i'm telling my colleagues

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,520
hey come check out this product this is

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,200
great the community is friendly

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,880
um there are many ways that i can

00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,960
provide feedback

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,080
um they are actually engaging in

00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,840
authentic ways

00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,640
it isn't a one-way street they're

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:02,799
listening they're giving back

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,720
and all of this is going to lead to that

00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:08,000
fierce loyalty that we all

00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,600
want and i think anyone that takes pride

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,600
in the work

00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,960
really finds that rewarding when they

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,840
feel like their product

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,760
is beloved and that you have people who

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,760
really depend on it because they

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,760
they understand that um it is the best

00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:24,480
solution for them right so

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,400
um keep in mind this uh currencies which

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,480
might not be tied to metrics

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,240
um there might be a bit more high level

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,640
altruistic but i think that they can

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:36,320
work for you as well

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,159
so let's go ahead and start wrapping it

00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,760
up and i apologize i went a bit

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,120
over time here to get to the point of

00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,840
the new community

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,799
just some key points to remember um i

00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,760
want you to be

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:51,600
a little bit like that um fella in the

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,720
graphic who's kind of holding

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,880
up the open source or logo and just this

00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,320
is where a bit of the heavy lifting

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,480
happens right this is when you need to

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,600
really reflect on the things that matter

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,400
what's important

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,400
so remember each person you're watching

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,400
you have the power to nurture you have

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,880
the power to engage your community

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,919
in a positive way you have the power to

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,600
listen

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,200
you have the power to surprise and

00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,320
delight your users

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:21,279
um i constantly tell folks when

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,799
i either attend the meet up or uh i'm

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,200
invited to a

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,720
speaking event for the engagement that

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,039
whether there is one person

00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,640
showing up or a thousand if you invite

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,880
me i'm going to come

00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,200
i'm going to show up and i'm going to

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,600
answer and i'm going to be there for you

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,440
it's my personality but i think it's so

00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,559
important you have an opportunity to

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,720
really delight

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,760
users to really have those personal

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,320
connections

00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,240
and it's not um a one-way street it's

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,440
not for them

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,919
only i also gained so much knowledge

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,799
um and just so many incredible

00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,640
experiences

00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,720
from the times that i really lean into

00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,559
community of course open source

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,799
community incredibly important

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,400
again take a moment to examine what are

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:07,520
you doing to give back

00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,200
what can you do as a company um if you

00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,080
were thinking of hey i don't

00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,120
necessarily know how to or what can i do

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,320
to get started

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:18,559
i'm always open to a chat um and i'll

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,000
pass my social phone in a moment of

00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:21,600
course scaling engagement

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,440
is going to help us scale your product

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,679
your product is going to be better

00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,760
ultimately it's going to optimize it and

00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,640
bring that business value

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,559
and hopefully the um dollar pounds

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,760
whatever currency sign

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,960
uh beyond that user loyalty which i

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,320
think is

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:44,080
even more valuable in my opinion

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:46,880
all right so um again

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,200
