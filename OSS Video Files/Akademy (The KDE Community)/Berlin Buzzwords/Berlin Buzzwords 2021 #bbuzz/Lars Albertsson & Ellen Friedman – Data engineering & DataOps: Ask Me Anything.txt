hello there

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,000

is in sweden

00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,399
uh but the two of us are basically hi

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,200
lars

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,079
hi alan pleased to meet you pleased to

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,440
see you

and join all of you as though we're

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,360
sitting at those wonderful big wooden

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,000
tables and benches outside the main

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,920
building

00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,360
at berlin buzzwords as we've done in

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,360
previous years

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,440
and so i'm going to use my imagination

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,480
and say this cup of tea is my glass of

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,000
prosecco

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:07,200
i'm envisioning yar lars has a beer

joining all of you for a good chat as we

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,520
would sit around these tables

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,200
take advantage of the fact that we have

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,759
access to lars and his

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,240
expertise and uh good and bad

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,280
experiences

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,320
adopt these modern approaches to here to

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,840
talk about

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,840
data ops about data engineering

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,520
about why these approaches can make a

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,479
tremendous difference in terms of how

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,119
you work and

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,799
productivity and organization also what

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,479
some of the challenges are

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,320
and the good news is he also has some

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,280
tips for how to overcome those

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,840
challenges

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,479
uh we welcome all of you to bring your

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,640
questions

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,600
i think this session is called ask lars

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,799
anything

00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,920
and so he's in the hot seat uh

00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,399
bring your questions uh to lars and put

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,920
those

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:04,479
in the questions window i think it will

00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,439
be the easiest way to do this

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,440
also feel free to uh bring your ideas

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,039
your comments your suggestions

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,959
and i'm going to start off with some

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,720
questions of my own for lars

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,160
we'll take more of your questions toward

00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,879
the end we may interrupt part way

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,400
through

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,480
let's just see where this whole thing

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,920
takes us now i want to do

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:26,239
a little more of a a formal introduction

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,840
uh to lars and i realized one of the

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,800
questions i should have asked him ahead

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,599
of time

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,239
is how to pronounce uh the name of his

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,400
company

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,160
oh i should introduce myself for a

00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,239
moment of

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,080
my role as principal technologists at

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,959
hewlett-packard working with

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,200
hpe esmerald data fabric some of you

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,599
will have known that technology

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,480
was built on what was formerly the map

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,640
our

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,599
data platform before map r was acquired

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,599
by hpe

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,200
so i tend to focus more on the data side

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,640
of things i think lars

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,480
looks not only at the data but

00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,519
especially at computation but mainly

00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,519
he's got that

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,360
huge amount of real world experience so

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,760
lars my first questions for you

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,720
are how do you pronounce your company

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,959
correctly

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,879
well you are the founder i believe in

00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,400
the the ceo of this company

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,400
this is a long question it's got four

00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,800
parts

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,000
and tell us a little bit about the work

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,959
that you're doing now but

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,599
also what brought you to this what were

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,840
the

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:29,200
the journey that got you there yeah um

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:31,280
well i shouldn't i shouldn't uh take my

00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,200
my whole life history here but there are

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,599
a couple of milestones who

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,400
who took me here and and the company

00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,200
name is

00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,560
skling by the way i realized that every

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,239
every company name has

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,159
has some kind of drawback you know it

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,040
means something dirty in some language

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,159
or something in my case it's or in our

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,920
case it's

00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,680
people don't know to pronounce whether

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,680
you pronounce it with a soft c or the

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,840
hard seed but it's a hard scene

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,519
it's clean um and what brought me here

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,280
uh there are a couple of milestones in

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,760
my career that like

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,959
brought me here uh the first one was was

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,159
in 2007

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,480
uh when i got lucky and was able to join

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:12,480
google as one of the first engineers in

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,439
stockholm

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,400
and we built uh was called google talk

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,079
video at the time

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,239
for the first video conferencing at

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,720
google we're now in the third generation

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:26,720
i think which is meat

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:30,320
and uh that was revolutionary

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,800
or they became a realized

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,639
or an eye opener for me and not because

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,479
of video conferencing but because i

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,880
realized how much value you can get out

00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,280
of the

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:40,800
data google sort of invented big data

00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,400
and they were the only ones doing it at

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:46,880
the time

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:49,120
um so as when i left google i tried to

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,040
gravitate towards data as much as

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,479
possible and what i didn't know when i

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,320
was at google was that

00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,120
was that spotify had just installed

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,600
their first hadoop cluster back in 2007.

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,759
uh it was just five machines beneath the

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,560
window

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,680
and uh so i joined a few spotify a few

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,919
years later and

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,440
built uh sort of one of the generations

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,520
of the spotify

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,160
internal data platform the the one where

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,720
we managed to go from just a few teams

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,840
being able to use hadoop and use data to

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,400
democratizing

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,360
in it in the in the whole company and

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,520
the use of data

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,520
completely exploded at spotify

00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,560
afterwards and they're still

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,160
sort of the the leader in terms of data

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,280
maturity and data usage in

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:37,039
scandinavia um

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,080
i my mission ever since has been to

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,240
spread

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,919
the value the superpowers that that like

00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,360
data and ai brings

00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:47,759
to to uh to companies to as

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,639
swedish or unscandinavian companies that

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,560
that i like

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:56,240
whose values i sympathize with and that

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,319
good things uh for for for the society

00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,400
at large or for the environment uh

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,919
not necessarily non-profit but just have

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,880
good values that i that i

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,479
sort of agree with and i for for a

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,080
number of years i tried to do that as a

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,080
freelance consultant

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,759
and i realized there is so much only so

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,039
much you can do because success with

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,520
data

00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,440
is not about the the technology or the

00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,000
tools of the machinery and usually i was

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,160
brought in to build machinery uh

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,360
basically and build a data platform for

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,880
us uh

00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,800
and so forth but it lies in the in the

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,960
ways that you work with data in how you

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,080
collaborate and and how you extract

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:36,240
value and so forth so so i

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,680
was often accompanist and saying well i

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,400
can build things for you but you

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,000
actually need

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,759
you know an organizational culture an

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,120
agile culture someone to transform the

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,680
way that you work and you and that's

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,880
what

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,280
effectively limits you

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,000
so uh we are now trying a different

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,120
approach

00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,919
where we uh collaborate uh with

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,840
companies

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,680
but in a different form so we're

00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,639
providing what we call data value as a

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,160
service and it's

00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:05,520
it's essentially a jointly operated

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:08,720
data factory uh where we

00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,759
help clients extract value from their

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,199
data

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,720
uh by uh channeling their data to our

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,039
platform and we build the

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,840
pipelines and refine it and if the

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,720
domain is

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,800
is complex uh then we uh we collaborate

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,880
very closely with the domain experts

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,360
and then we we have this uh we run this

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,840
factory as a sort of a refinery

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,360
uh so you can view it as the uh the

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,000
externalized uh or

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,080
outsourced data team or data department

00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,560
and then we channel back refined data so

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,120
from from raw events we channel back

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,319
like recommendation indexes or a fraud

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:46,479
detection service or

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:48,560
reports or anything from mundane simple

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,800
things like reports to to machine

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,960
learning so it's it's a bit of a hybrid

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,440
between a consultant because we do

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,120
customize things and a a product company

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,680
because we have our platform and we run

00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,440
everything

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,800
internally on that platform but we don't

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,080
actually sell it

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,280
and so making this more generalized for

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,080
the audience

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,560
is so that they can see themselves in

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,560
this

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,160
the kinds of challenges that people

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,840
might have with data

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,520
that they would either have to saw

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,440
themselves or they might go to

00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,120
to you and your company for those

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,360
services

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,039
what would be the the motivations what

00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,280
would be the moment that that

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,960
a company says we need to do this

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,440
whether they do it with you or you know

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,959
figure out a way to do it themselves

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:35,360
yes uh so the uh

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:38,560
one of the challenges for us is to find

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,560
some humble companies

00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,399
because this is so popular nowadays

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,800
right

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,240
and and people think how hard can it be

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,519
and then they apply a couple of data

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,360
scientists or or

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,680
a couple years ago we used to have this

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,839
giant hadoop or data lake project

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,640
and they became reasonable failures now

00:08:53,839 --> 00:09:00,640
people have ai projects instead

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,120
and uh so um lots of companies tend

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,839
tend to think that this is not so hard

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,600
uh

00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:10,080
and and we can easily build some some

00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,120
technology and do it but it turns out

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,240
like for example

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:17,600
lean transformations it's not very

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,360
easy to do and most people fail so

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,279
quite often the companies that come to

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,640
us are the ones

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:27,519
that know that they cannot compete

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,480
for data engineers data scientists and

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,880
so forth

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,600
on the market so what uh our first

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,160
customer was it was a big retail chain

00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,040
their i.t department was like 26 people

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,360
or something and they

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,560
didn't really have a they had an analyst

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,120
or two

00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,560
so they had nothing to compete with

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,640
against the banks and insurance

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,240
companies and so forth they were

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,320
screening for the same talent so then we

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,240
were a suitable solution

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,240
and now we have um

00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:01,200
we have care one client in

00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,800
in the elderly care business also uh

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:07,200
quite humble with their capability and

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,959
and i just spoke uh earlier today with a

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,120
with a mining company

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,079
also not data as their their core

00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,360
business so so

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:17,519
it's it's that's typically a divider

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,519
if you're a bank or a telco your data is

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,720
your core business and then they tend to

00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,000
have the ambition to

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,399
to do it themselves uh and but

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,480
that also means that they realize that

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:32,800
maybe they don't know the way

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:36,800
forward uh right so they often come

00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,760
uh with an idea that we have data and it

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:41,040
has potential

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,200
but first they need help in

00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,120
uh you know workshopping their way

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,399
forward to the most

00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,440
useful ideas and so forth and

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,040
uh that's when you know we contribute

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,640
with it with the

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:59,440
the way of working is important because

00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,920
i've seen so many data projects fail

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,000
because

00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,600
they are driven by you know poor the

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
data in the data lake and then we hope

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,320
so that some magic happens and so forth

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,800
uh but what i've learned in working with

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,959
the successful data companies is that

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,800
uh success comes from being driven by

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,120
use case and being driven by business

00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,279
while

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,480
now you're working your way backwards so

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,800
the

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:26,079
uh so it's usu it's often as much

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,000
that they need help with with these ways

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,839
of working and how to

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,440
fix how to think about business value

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,200
and data as it is

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,800
uh with the technology and the actual

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,360
execution

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,720
so given what you just described and

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,800
i've uh by the way

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,000
audience i've just tried sticking a

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,079
question in the

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,360
in the chat or the the question window

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,200
myself

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,880
to see if i know how to do this and make

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,279
sure i see your questions

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,040
um so i've made a note to self here

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,279
let's ask lars

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,079
the issues that you're describing and by

00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,839
the way i love your

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,399
comment about your in search of the the

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:03,120
humble company the humble person

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,000
uh but they they may be they may be

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,120
humble or they

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,120
may need to be humble regardless of the

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,440
size of the company or the particular

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,959
sector

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,120
i would think the kind of issues that

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,800
you're talking about

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,480
really come across for anyone who's

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,839
trying to extract

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,040
value from data and either haven't built

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,440
their own team yet

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,800
aren't prepared to build their own team

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,720
you know have tried it but haven't been

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,639
really as successful as they wanted or

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,399
have a huge team but know that they

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,000
there are approaches that can make them

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,040
much more efficient

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
and so am i right thinking it's not a

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,040
particular size

00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,800
company it's a a situation that can

00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:48,320
pull closer it's a situation yes uh

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,680
i i i also had conversation with very

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,279
large companies

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:56,560
where they where product managers

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,600
are uh aware that they could do more

00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,200
right then they want to build

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,680
data-driven products maybe they come

00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,680
from a more data mature company earlier

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,959
but they and they have a you know a lake

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,360
in the entertainment and

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,560
might not be delivering what they need

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,320
uh so

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,560
and and that makes them reach out

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,440
externally for help just as they might

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,480
take in

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:20,079
a a niche consultant they might partner

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,160
with us

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,000
for the medium companies partnering with

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,279
us is a

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,760
sort of a strategic uh decision right we

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,480
become the team that builds the data

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:34,560
platform

00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:37,120
and the daily link and so forth and uh

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,160
although we do occasionally do smaller

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:41,199
you know

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,839
one-off little things as i say

00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,959
as an early start it you need some kind

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,079
of size

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:50,880
to motivate building up a a

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,199
lake and a platform yeah and so i would

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,120
think

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,880
even for people who do eventually they

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,160
either want to use a service like this

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,000
so that they don't have to build

00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,720
themselves or if they are planning to

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,880
build it

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,480
it certainly could work better uh to

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,160
first get some success

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,480
under the belt you know i i think

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,920
there's a a great lesson to watch how

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,920
something is done well

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,600
uh even if you plan to do it you know

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,360
yourself later so you can

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,360
understand what works and what doesn't

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,560
and it also you know has you

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,440
uh has you in in motion uh

00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,040
uh kind of absolutely and it's the

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,480
fastest way to learn right i

00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,279
i have been with so many developers that

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,839
come into

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,800
the to the big data world and and they

00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,079
have a background

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,079
from software engineering or from

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,199
analytics or or data science or

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,600
something

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,240
and then uh the you know the first three

00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,199
months

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,120
they are confused uh not by necessarily

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:44,639
by the complex technology but the new

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,839
ways of working

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,680
uh and and then after six months they

00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,440
they are

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,000
they sort of grasp the concepts and they

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,399
are ready to teach the next person

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,880
coming in and there's no if more

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,040
efficient way to learn that than to work

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,920
with people who've done it a long time

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,880
in production

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:10,160
in sharp real reality

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:14,079
and something that i have very front

00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:16,800
very front of mine because i've been

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:18,240
working with this a lot working with the

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,839
the people who

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,880
are using our hp data fabric ezreal data

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,639
fabric

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:26,560
also ted dunning and i just finished

00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,839
another of these short books

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,440
called ai and analytics at scale and one

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,920
of the issues that we bring up

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,720
and i i think this underlies what you're

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,160
saying

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,720
is that some people aren't necessarily

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,639
looking for a solution because they

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,839
don't even think a better way to do

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,720
something is possible

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,160
or a different way to put it is just

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,399
because they've

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,639
put something together and it's working

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,440
today doesn't mean it's working well

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,240
and more importantly it doesn't mean it

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,320
will

00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,519
scale and scale with not just larger

00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,800
amounts of data but different

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,800
applications

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,920
uh have the flexibility to do new things

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,440
without

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,440
interruption or without having to

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,920
re-architect and then that leads

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,959
uh companies especially i t to just say

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,279
no

00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,880
every time a new idea comes so sometimes

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,720
it kind of looks like things are working

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,360
but it's really missed opportunities

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,920
i think you're talking about either

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,759
using

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:23,600
services like your company or building

00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,600
services like that into

00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,720
a company so that that greater

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,880
efficiency and

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,480
and being scale efficient and making use

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,440
of things like data ops

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,639
um can actually make it possible not

00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,680
only do what you're doing

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,440
today better but say yes to to new

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,480
things does that does that fit with your

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,839
experience

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,040
absolutely um and when you look at it

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,320
it's usually

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,959
the uh it's usually conway's law it's

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,199
sort of the

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,000
organization of the of the company

00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,000
that's

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,480
reflecting in the products and

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,720
reflecting in the flow of data so

00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,480
i um i wrote the blog post i think it

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,079
was two years ago i was going to shop

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,360
something at ikea

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:09,039
i'm in sweden i shop furniture at ikea

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:12,319
uh and uh and i went through the website

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,319
you know and search for the thing

00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,120
results if they had just ranked by

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,360
popularity i would have been much faster

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,360
and

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,959
i when i clicked on the thing there was

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,360
no cross links to the

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,079
to the relevant information so forth and

00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,039
you could see

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,079
in this experience right with in every

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,200
single step

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:33,280
they sort of failed to match my

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,120
expectations of them showing the right

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,320
data not because they were not

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,520
able to or because it wasn't there but

00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,640
because i could see

00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,320
a a a boundary between teams inside the

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,120
organization right here was a search

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,640
team and here was

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,280
the catalog team and how was the

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,799
checkout team and so forth

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,679
uh and you could see that there's so

00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,840
much potential

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,120
in in cutting down the friction to to

00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,799
more revenue

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,640
if you just focus on not acting so

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,039
no artificial intelligence i call the

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,679
blog post uh that i wrote i wore the

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,840
official

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,440
stupidity because that was what it's all

00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,200
about you already have the information

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,640
about my address just put it in the

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,480
field right i don't know i don't want to

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:18,160
type it

00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,080
and and then six months passed

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,919
and then i checked it went there again

00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,679
and they had redesigned the whole thing

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:28,000
and made this really smooth

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:31,039
transition and that was user customer

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,400
oriented and i was like yes

00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:36,000
you grasped it now i love this

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,440
comment that you just made i haven't

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,039
heard anybody say it that way but it's

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,200
just beautiful the sense that

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,200
you have that in this case the first

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,320
experience a frustrating

00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,559
uh user experience but you can see

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,919
in there you can see those barriers

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,679
between teams

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,120
uh because you have the experience to

00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,799
know the difference of

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,200
it's kind of working or it's working

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,559
well so let's take that moment and sort

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,000
of pivot here and

00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:04,559
and let's jump in more deeply into

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,640
uh talking about what what data ops

00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:08,000
actually is and what i mean by it may be

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,080
a little different than what you mean by

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,200
it and it hasn't become a kind of a

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,960
buzzy term

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,320
so i'm just going to throw this out for

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:19,520
the audience you'll hear data ops

00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,679
devops mlaps i loved a term that lars

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:25,360
did in a comment back to me the

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:28,799
the everything ops all the other ops

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:29,360
and i just have two two suggestions as

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,840
we

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,799
have lars jump more deeply into this uh

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:39,120
but for the audience

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:40,160
don't be overly distracted by the exact

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,000
definition

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,760
let's take data outs exact different

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,679
what i mean by it what he means by maybe

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,080
slightly different

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,919
don't get lost in fine point you know

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,360
we're not a third grade teacher here

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,360
we don't have to have kids right out of

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,520
definition uh

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,520
so don't get lost in the definition but

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,120
the same time because these words have

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,720
gotten kind of latched on to my

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,760
marketing departments and so forth and

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,799
they're very buzzy

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:08,240
excuse me buzz words

00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:11,120
it also don't discount them

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,799
because there is enormous value in these

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,039
approaches

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,919
the kind of overlapping approaches of

00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,520
data ops

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:20,240
in particular and all the the different

00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,400
ops the ideas behind them and

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,559
executed well can make a tremendous

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,240
difference in organizations and how they

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:29,039
work in the productivity

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,120
in the user experience as large as just

00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:33,200
described as you begin to see a

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:36,480
transition in how things work

00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:39,919
so uh with that in mind

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:43,440
launch us into what is data ops

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:45,120
uh what kind of problems do they solve

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,440
now you gotta be curious can i hear your

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,360
definition

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,039
well mine is much more simplistic and

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,400
remember i'm the one that communicates

00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:53,600
with people about these things you're

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,880
the one who actually goes in there in

00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,960
the real world

00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,120
rolls up your sleeves put your hands in

00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,600
and helps people build the systems

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,280
uh and also i have a very data centric

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,840
point of view because i've worked four

00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,720
years

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,159
with the the data fabric technology and

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,080
people who are trying to bring data

00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,520
together on that

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:17,120
so with that in mind data ops to me

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,039
is an approach that is i look at kind of

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,240
the human cultural side of it

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:24,240
and the specifically with regard to data

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,640
but very much what you said of that

00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,159
breaking down these walls between teams

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,440
and i have a little figure i've used in

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,720
a couple of books and things i've

00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,000
written so you have to imagine i'm

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,159
drawing it here in the air

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,440
you have the different departments uh

00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,960
within a company

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:41,600
and things tend to get compartmentalized

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,200
you know are you the the database person

00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,720
are you the machine learning person or

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,760
you know or you and i t

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,760
whatever um but with the data ops

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:53,280
approach you kind of think of a team

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:54,240
cross cutting with cross functional

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,559
skills

00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,559
and not just touchy feely words but

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,960
literally the person sitting in the seat

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,080
who who engineers the data collects the

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,360
data who

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:06,880
uh processes it who finds it who stores

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,799
it who handles it for

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,400
data versioning if you're doing machine

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,240
learning the person who's actually

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,000
building the model hopefully the people

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,320
who are talking to

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,320
the domain experts so all this is done

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,159
set into appropriate context

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,080
the people who are going to deploy

00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,919
things or it doesn't have to be machine

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,760
learning and data ops anybody's

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,600
working analytics whatever they're doing

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,320
with data extracting value

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,760
who's who's determining how people share

00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,240
data all of that

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,320
everybody's got a role and they can be

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,520
expert in the thing that they do

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:43,120
but if you build that cross-functional

00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,799
team they're focused on a shared goal

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,960
and at the human level it can mean

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,799
things as simple as

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,480
i have my role to play you have your

00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,159
role to play but if you ask me to do

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,120
something it's not like you're asking a

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,760
favor of me to process or get this data

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,080
for you

00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,840
is we're all you know rowing in the same

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:02,400
boat and going the same direction

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,919
and i think that changes how people feel

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,679
about certainly changes the

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,960
communication lines

00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:11,280
that go across the team toward the goal

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,039
as opposed to constantly up to

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,880
you know some other manager and that can

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:17,039
really slow things down so that's a

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,480
i think a very small aspect of it but

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:21,440
that's kind of my

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,520
slice through it yeah we are in

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,840
essentially in complete agreement i i i

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,200
think

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:28,159
the the uh important aspect of data ops

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,000
is the human side

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:32,240
i'd like to take a like a historical

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,360
perspective on it and that goes back to

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:38,480
the 70s there was this guy called

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:42,480
roy and roy the the water

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:45,520
fault paper uh back i think it was 1970

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,760
um and uh

00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,440
he wrote this paper and which was an

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,799
observation of how people were were

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,039
working at the time and it's

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:55,120
he said it seems to follow this uh this

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,679
like linear engineering process that we

00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,640
all know

00:23:55,679 --> 00:24:00,960
with you know design uh requirements and

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:04,320
design and coding and

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,600
uh quality assurance and deployment and

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,159
so forth

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,799
and then and at the end of the paper he

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,880
he like

00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,480
he said this is probably not a good idea

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,760
and i have some suggestions here for

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,000
improvements and this

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,679
started scratching on agile but people

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,240
read this paper and says yes that's what

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,480
we do

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,360
we we now have a method let's call it

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,720
waterfall

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,400
and there we were and

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,320
that was a completely compartment

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,320
compartmentalized right you threw things

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,360
over the wall to the next stage

00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:35,039
all of the time and eventually somebody

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,640
figured out that hey maybe we shouldn't

00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,240
throw things over the wall to the qa

00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,840
people let's work together with them

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,279
right and that was called extreme

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,799
programming because it was such an

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,279
extreme idea

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,400
and then people realized maybe we should

00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:49,600
like uh

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,919
you know have the design and coding be

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,679
intermingled and iterative and figure

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,640
out what people want and and that was

00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:58,080
called agile

00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:00,960
it's not another set of people that are

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,720
working together and then eventually

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,440
when we reached operations it was called

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,520
devops

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,200
because we were the developers were

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,000
working with operations

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,720
and now uh when when sort of big data

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,400
entered the

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:16,960
this scene uh we started working

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,559
uh we started throwing things out and

00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,440
then measuring and bringing back the

00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:23,200
measurements to affect the design right

00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,960
and so big data is not about technology

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,279
it's about a new way of

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,440
working together towards multiple

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:31,200
disciplines towards the same goal

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,200
and then when that that reached out to

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,760
operations as well we got data ops and

00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,279
then we

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,200
threw in the data scientists and then we

00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:41,039
got envelopes so

00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,440
all of these like shifting left

00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,159
uh things are all all about getting

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,159
people

00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,480
with different skill sets and different

00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,640
mindsets to work together towards the

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,240
same goal and explicitly be very

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,640
explicit about this

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,320
same goal uh it used to be like

00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,360
development and qa had completely

00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,039
different goals right

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,360
one was to produce bikes the other was

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,640
it was to squash or find the bags and

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,960
the operations also

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,559
they didn't want any deployments because

00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,360
they would risk their stability and

00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,480
their bonuses

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,320
and and so forth uh and late very late

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,000
to the game we have security who who's

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,840
been uh

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,440
detached forever like but now we're

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:19,279
seeing some dev set props and

00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,559
and things are are shifting left there

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,720
as well so

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,559
it's really on the human side and then

00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,240
uh if you if you start

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,080
there and work towards the same goal

00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,919
then there are things

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,360
that you need to do that you perhaps

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,440
didn't think about

00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,960
doing before like measuring quality of

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,559
things measuring data quality for the

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,559
benefits of

00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,720
of of the people doing quality assurance

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,799
or or the people who care about the

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,880
the machine learning models working in

00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,600
production and so forth so it affects

00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,919
the

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,520
activities and processes and tooling but

00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:52,080
it's really this

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,200
this align goal that that sort of the

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,960
the gist of

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,799
of their knobs and i think

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,559
i really like the way you put that this

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,240
early starting with the the waterfall

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,200
stage this idea of throwing things over

00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,520
the wall

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,080
uh and and you're really saying stop you

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,000
know pull pull down the wall and

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,360
hand things because it's not a throw it

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,120
over the wall and you know hope a

00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,039
miracle happens

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,640
and there's no no feedback about you

00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,240
know the these things are or

00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,720
should be fluid i think from what you're

00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,960
supposed to be it has been like that for

00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,880
when data science first came in right

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,159
they were writing their models in python

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,919
throwing them over the wall got

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,919
translated to java throwing all the

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:33,200
walter operations and so forth and

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:37,120
that creates very slow cycles so so

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:40,480
a data ops and amalaps is really

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:42,000
a key success factor to to succeeding

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,679
with data or succeeding with machine

00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,240
learning it's absolutely necessary to

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,559
have

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,480
in order to have sustained success with

00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,399
data machine learning

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,399
so uh you saw me just move a piece of

00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:54,159
paper here i had a little note

00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,520
uh to remind myself in some of our

00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,200
conversations

00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,720
uh and i want to make sure we have time

00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:02,240
to hit all of this but

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:04,720
uh you've reminded people that in uh

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,480
google had defined in mlaps kind of

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,679
three levels of maturity

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,559
uh zero if you're doing it with a a

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:17,440
stick and a

00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:19,520
and a and a rock no i'm sorry that's

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:21,919
level one is you're beginning to build

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,880
an ml pipeline level two

00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:27,039
uh cid cd you're doing continuous

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,799
integration continuous deployment

00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:33,039
for pipeline automation and i think that

00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,880
that style it's not exactly that same

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:38,159
thing but that level two

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,640
uh kind of approach or mindset uh

00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,000
sounds a lot like with things that i've

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,360
heard you say or seen

00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,120
seen you write about the kinds of

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,799
services that you're bringing to people

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,919
but to do this within

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,880
the the data ops world uh to get into

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,919
that style do

00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:57,039
am i understanding that correctly uh yes

00:28:53,919 --> 00:29:00,240
um absolutely we i

00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,559
have realized that we come from a when i

00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,200
say

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,000
we here the our company and and you know

00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,200
the

00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,919
the general uh sphere of

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:12,240
people in stockholm the that uh i've

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:15,520
worked with so far we come from a

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,520
fairly different

00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,480
direction with a different angle on

00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:23,760
working with data and data engineering

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:27,440
than most of the people that i meet

00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:31,120
because when uh

00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:33,520
we adopted hadoop very early and hadoop

00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,039
was really primitive at the time it

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,880
could only do a few things like

00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:40,799
mapreduce and store lots of data

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:43,840
and and a no and so forth

00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:45,919
and that really forced us into

00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:47,919
regarding these data problems as

00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:50,240
software engineering problems right

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,200
and towards a very high degree of

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,240
automation

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,320
and it enforced the

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,760
functional parenting but on their

00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,440
architecture level the

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,200
data sets are immutable because there is

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,080
no way to to

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,279
edit them anyway so you have to do

00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,480
express things in functional

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:07,919
transformations that

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,600
which is the only thing you can do with

00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:13,200
mapreduce right

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:15,919
and um that was

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,440
lucky because we were these are some of

00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,799
the key points in

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,600
in successful data is to adopt these

00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:25,120
these

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:27,520
principles of functional paradigms of

00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:29,360
um immutability functional

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,559
transformations workflow orchestration

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,399
to keep the whole thing

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:35,200
together and uh retrying everything

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,520
would pull

00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,840
so that it's naturally stable and so

00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:42,640
forth and we got a few things right by

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,440
uh creating luigi the first uh first

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,880
sort of modern

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,120
workflow orchestration which has

00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,159
made which was the key thing that made

00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,919
us a scale

00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:57,279
to to thousands of pipelines

00:30:53,919 --> 00:31:00,159
and uh nowadays there are so many things

00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:02,559
right that you can choose from and uh

00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,480
they are not pushing you

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,679
as an adopter today they are not pushing

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,840
you towards the

00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,039
the seeing the whole problem of software

00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,679
engineering and

00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:12,880
and uh towards high degrees of

00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,480
automation

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,480
because there is no money there the

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,519
vendors all go to meet you

00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,399
where you are right

00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,919
what's your process uh okay you are you

00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:26,080
you're used to sql

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,080
databases and mutable tables and so

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,919
forth okay we'll we'll tack this thing

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,519
on to hadoop or to the cloud so that you

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,000
can keep your workflows but you can

00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,880
still buy

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,559
our thing and thereby they're eroding

00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,399
the whole value because the whole value

00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:41,919
wasn't changing your workflows

00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:43,360
yeah yeah um so now i went on a

00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,679
little round here but this is some of

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,240
the the sort of misconceptions that that

00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,320
i see

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:53,600
and this is i i believe uh

00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,799
this we came from from a highly

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,240
automated

00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:59,840
environment and this makes us view data

00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,080
working with data very differently from

00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,200
the

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:06,240
from their doctors today so

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:08,480
by the way i liked your rant so

00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,600
i've a few notes here of some questions

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,120
i want to ask and i just start

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,360
reshuffling the cards

00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,399
because i want to take take us where you

00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,480
took us just now

00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:18,240
with this little this little rant and

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,200
two two ideas so

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,159
um i think a key idea for people to take

00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,000
away from this

00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:27,519
is the sense of yes the shared goal yes

00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,919
the cross-functional team

00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,960
but also what you just touched on this

00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,679
sense of

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,880
uh why it matters to automate some of

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,519
these processes

00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,440
and to and and how to automate them and

00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:42,240
how to automate them well

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,840
the immutable input immutable output why

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,320
those kinds of approaches

00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,519
are good and at first glance it can

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:49,840
sound like that

00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,679
then gives people less flexibility but

00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,360
it actually gives them more flexibility

00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,080
i think because if you

00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,440
build the basic logistics more

00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:01,200
effectively

00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,799
then it's easier to to make changes to

00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,640
add new things in because not

00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,559
everything is having to be done one step

00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,399
at a time is that

00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:12,960
is that it's basically about pushing the

00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,440
cost down of your operations and your

00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,519
toil

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,120
and of the the cost of running new

00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,080
experiments because you need to run

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,159
experiments and

00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,159
sometimes succeed sometimes failing or

00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,159
in order to to get forward that

00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,799
that's uh one of the things that that uh

00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:31,039
jeff bezos uh brings out when it when

00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,880
asked about amazon success we were able

00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:34,559
to do a thousand experiments

00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,960
in instead of a hundred experiments and

00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:39,760
that made makes a lot of difference

00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,159
um so one way to look at it here is is

00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,279
uh

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:45,279
what i the three phases that i call

00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,039
of any human activity that i call like

00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:48,480
muscle powered and mechanized and

00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,399
industrialized

00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,679
uh so if you look like forestry you can

00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:53,760
have a handsaw

00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,039
or an axe to cut your tree down and then

00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:58,320
you get a chainsaw

00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:00,559
and it's you still you you as a human

00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,399
but you know you have a power tool and

00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,760
then the next step is is forestry

00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:05,679
machines where there's

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,519
quite not so much human involvement but

00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:11,040
the machine sort of does

00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:12,800
all of the work uh and in every activity

00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,359
that you can find like transportation

00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,359
food

00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:21,200
there's a equivalent three phases of

00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:23,200
evolution and uh the the

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,639
corresponding for data is spreadsheet is

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,399
the muscle powered thing right

00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,560
that the human essentially does all of

00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,800
the things and the data warehouse era is

00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,839
the

00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,399
is the epitome of

00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:35,520
uh or the crest of all the uh power

00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:38,079
tools era where it's

00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,119
where it's everything is controlled by

00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:43,119
humans

00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:45,119
uh and with little automation

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,320
uh but it's it's sort of steered by the

00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,440
analyst usually for

00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:52,399
for bi purposes so what what uh

00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,079
and google uh in the early to notice

00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:55,760
took us into the into this

00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:59,440
industrialized era

00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,680
where uh where humans no longer work

00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,240
with the actual data

00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,359
they work with a process that that

00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,440
transforms the data

00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,480
just like the you know in the toyota

00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,560
factory there's

00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,480
there's very little humans that actually

00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:14,000
touch the car primarily it's it's

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,000
machines that

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:18,079
touch the car with some exceptions of

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,240
course right

00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:25,839
and but the majority of companies

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:28,800
are remain in this mechanized

00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:30,000
stage and only the big tech companies

00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,760
like we in scandinavia

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,520
one of like four or five companies

00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,640
perhaps that are

00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,920
mature in this industrialized stage i

00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:40,800
know there's a lot more

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,839
silicon valley is is a number of years

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,040
ahead of us

00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:47,760
here um but the majority of companies

00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,640
are are in the uh in the power tools

00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,680
stage

00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:54,400
and that's where the the the revenue

00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,720
and and the money is so that's what what

00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,000
the

00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:02,000
what the vendors sort of go for but

00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:04,000
the or the cost of running things

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,480
is is several orders of magnitude

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,839
between the muscle powered and the uh

00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,599
and the mechanized and between the

00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,920
mechanized and the

00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:13,839
uh and the industrialized and people

00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,480
don't realize how big these differences

00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,880
are but if

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,400
you i've talked to lots of like bank

00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,400
telcos and so forth

00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,560
here in sweden and and when i asked them

00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,119
so so your analytics department or

00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,000
your data warehouse like how how many

00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,680
data sets

00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,200
does it produce each day and they they

00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,760
might have you know 80 people working

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,920
with

00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,839
with bi or analytics and they say well

00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,680
we produce like 500

00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:38,640
uh different reports or things for

00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:41,119
dashboards or whatever each day

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,240
right and then go to spotify and and

00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:45,359
they are producing

00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:47,680
a few hundred thousand data sets per day

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,880
right so so it's it's like three orders

00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,880
of magnitude

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,800
uh and then you go to google and then

00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,280
they're not they're rarely official with

00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,960
these

00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,359
things but five years ago they said they

00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:00,160
were producing 1.6 billion data sets

00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:01,119
per day right so so people think that oh

00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:03,359
well maybe 10

00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,960
times more with like thousands of times

00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:08,400
more right and

00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,079
then the cost goes down for right

00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,680
obviously they don't have like tens of

00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:13,760
thousands or more people but the cost

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,920
of running a thing goes down and you

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,440
spread the the knowledge and the ability

00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,320
in the organization

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:20,640
and then people can do new things right

00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,720
so

00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,720
so if the cost is very high you can only

00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:27,359
do the most valuable things like like

00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:28,560
counting your revenue or or your uh

00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,400
marketing

00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,400
steering your marketing decisions and so

00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,760
forth uh but then it goes down and then

00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,800
you can do things like a b

00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,400
testing and uh and the product uh

00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,760
insights and so forth and if it goes

00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,200
further down you get to the machine

00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,040
learning that that's usually the

00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,720
part with the lowest return of

00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,520
investment so you really have to push

00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,079
things further down in order for that to

00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,160
be

00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,800
like available to you to get to get

00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:54,960
sustainable ride for machine learning i

00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,280
love to hear you say this i i

00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,839
wrote i don't know a year ago six months

00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,760
ago an article for cio.com called can

00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:04,960
you afford innovation

00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,000
exactly and and also with the the things

00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,480
that you know i've

00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,760
written or said with uh with uh ted

00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,800
dunning who's the

00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,920
cto for data fabric here at hpe uh

00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,480
so many times uh looking at this

00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,119
question

00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,400
exactly what you just said of when by

00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,160
the time you are looking at machine

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,200
learning and ai

00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,880
these are um

00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,320
exploratory approaches they're

00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,320
speculative and the potential payoff

00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,359
for those approaches that happen to hit

00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:36,560
right and work

00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:37,200
are enormous and um enormous not just in

00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,960
terms of

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,320
money revenue changes you can do

00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,599
different things move at a different

00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,839
speed but also

00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,720
enormous in terms of literal literal

00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:46,800
payback

00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,480
but it's not you start a project and you

00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,520
just guarantee on this date

00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:54,720
you know it's it's paying back they are

00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:58,160
uh speculative and so if you lower that

00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,079
uh entry cost because for example you're

00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,920
sharing data or because your overall

00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,119
operation costs are less or you have

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,400
that ability

00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:08,480
uh to innovate uh it costs the

00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,480
the the cost of trying it is so much

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,280
less you can try more things and the

00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,960
likelihood of

00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,960
hitting the one that's going to pay off

00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,680
goes up i think that's a real key to

00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,359
people who say

00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:21,680
you know does ai bring real value or or

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:23,280
does it not well it very much depends on

00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,520
those kinds of approaches and if you

00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,800
have built in a way to take action

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,200
you know again these things are not

00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,440
magic and so i think your

00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,240
your kind of operations extend not just

00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,440
to the

00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:37,200
the goes-ins but what happens to the

00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,520
goes-outs how do you

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,720
how do you deliver insights from data

00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,720
but then is that

00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:44,320
tied again those those walls between

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,640
teams is it tied to

00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,920
either a human action or an automated a

00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,640
machine action but something that

00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,599
actually

00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,119
you know it carries that into uh into

00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,920
the real world so i'm just

00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:57,760
thrilled to hear you say that well we're

00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:59,280
nearing the end of our time so i want to

00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,160
jump in and just ask you

00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,440
completely for well first of all this is

00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,560
if there's something you want to tell us

00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,720
or a question you want to

00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:09,440
ask ask your own question but here's my

00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,440
question for you

00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,640
you know so i'll i'll give you a plug i

00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,400
think the

00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,079
one of the best advice people can do if

00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,240
they want to try these approaches is

00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:20,720
contact you

00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,160
and talk about it but say they're doing

00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:25,760
it for themselves

00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:29,040
what advice do you give

00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,839
and let's say if you're the uh the

00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:33,359
developer

00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:34,480
the the the engineer the data engineer

00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:37,359
hearing this

00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,240
um or any other persona you want to

00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:41,040
advise

00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:43,119
but what is the practical advice uh

00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,000
first of all to be able to tell

00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:46,880
whether is is your organization already

00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,640
doing this

00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,240
or are they kind of look like they're

00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,359
doing it but you know what are the hints

00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,880
that it's not

00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:54,400
they're not they haven't really tapped

00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,839
in and then if

00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,079
if they do feel like they want to make

00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:59,280
these changes how do they

00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,280
you know what steps what are the

00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,160
practical start today steps for people

00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,280
to take

00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,079
yeah so uh the question are you are you

00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,480
doing it

00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:11,040
you can you can find an answer to that

00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,760
by by measuring agility right the

00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:14,480
uh i'm sure you and some of the

00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,480
listeners are

00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,920
aware of the dora report the devops

00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,839
reports and

00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,280
the accelerate book which i recommend

00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:24,880
everyone to read

00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:26,800
um they they measure agility in terms of

00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,920
operations and devops right and one of

00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,079
the

00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,440
and and they measured reliability and a

00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,800
whole bunch of other things but one of

00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,040
the measurements of

00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,119
agility is how long does it take you to

00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:39,200
get an id out into production right or

00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:42,480
line of code out into production

00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:45,920
and the uh the elite uh minutes

00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:48,000
and uh the the training trailers

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,520
you know six months which is what it

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,440
used to be like

00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:56,319
uh and uh you can measure similarly in

00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,119
data agility like if i have an idea of

00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:58,960
how to use

00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:01,440
these three pieces of data that are

00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,920
spread uh throughout the company for

00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,280
for uh protection or whatever how long

00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,599
does it take me to get that

00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,400
idea out into production well that's

00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,680
that's at least

00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:14,839
six months in most companies uh and

00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:18,240
uh what is blocking you right is for is

00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:20,720
uh are questions that you can ask

00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:22,800
in order to to figure out how to bring

00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:23,520
that agility down or if you have data

00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,040
flows

00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:29,280
uh and as sort of have

00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:31,040
gotten to some kind of level of maturity

00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:34,160
what does it take to

00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,800
uh change these data flows uh so i threw

00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,720
out a

00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,640
poll on twitter today right if you were

00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,599
to change the meaning of one field how

00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,640
does

00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,400
from uh early up upstream in your data

00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,040
pipelines how long does it take until

00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,920
that

00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,880
change has propagated a very trivial

00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,119
change

00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,720
and the majority of answers was it was

00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,319
more than six months

00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,800
and that's nothing to be ashamed of we

00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:58,400
had these fields at spotify that we can

00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,920
get rid of for years

00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:05,119
uh but that is those things are

00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:08,240
are slowing you down right and and those

00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:10,000
they uh slow down innovation they the

00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,680
things you can't get rid of accumulate

00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,680
technique and so on but

00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,720
the ability to innovate is more

00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,760
important than the

00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:20,400
ability to clean up your debt so how

00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,400
so if you are in an organization and you

00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,720
say this sounds good to me

00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,200
and yeah i want to you know i want to

00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:29,839
take that step what are some

00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,880
yeah that was a great description of how

00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:33,280
can you tell

00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,960
are you already there uh and some of

00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,280
this you know people may say it sounds

00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:39,200
good but they're not the ones

00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,640
you know pulling the strings to say now

00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,720
we're going to go in this

00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,240
in this new direction so how can people

00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:47,680
begin to

00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,720
um get either either take initial steps

00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,240
themselves or

00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:53,040
are trying other people's organization

00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,040
to

00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,880
to say yeah they're really there's a

00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,760
valuable other approach or what you said

00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,280
earlier

00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,160
that that uh motivate people toward this

00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,240
desire for

00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,599
for automation for a data ops type

00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:07,599
approach and

00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,680
this is where when we get to you don't

00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,440
need me to build technology you need an

00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:14,960
organizational coach

00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:17,359
and so so uh what i would

00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:19,040
say these days if you ask me if five

00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:21,119
years ago i would decide well

00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,480
you know build these things on in the

00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,040
cloud build the spot cluster or whatever

00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,400
that that

00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,880
doesn't matter at all uh what you need

00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,680
to do

00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,720
is to figure out what what would the end

00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,119
goal look like right

00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,240
what what what would a piece of success

00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,079
look like

00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,079
and then and then you go backwards from

00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,720
there and say we have these data sources

00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,200
and and

00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:43,839
what does it take to bring them and bri

00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:47,040
and get our computation

00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:49,440
in production to to fulfill the end goal

00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,040
and then you bring in tools such as like

00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,240
value stream mapping

00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:56,160
uh which is a way to figure out where

00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,200
you spend your time when when you're

00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,079
developing a

00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,599
product right and and in most value

00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:04,640
stream maps you you

00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:06,720
the the result is that you realize that

00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:09,040
you spend one percent of your time

00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:10,480
doing the real work the coding or the

00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,160
testing or whatever and then you spend

00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,400
99 of your

00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,280
of your time waiting for people waiting

00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:17,440
for an approval

00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,280
waiting for for somebody else to put in

00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,560
the backlog in your private and so forth

00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:22,960
and if you get to 10

00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:24,079
then your your elite awesome right so

00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:27,359
most organizations

00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:31,359
don't go beyond the same single digits

00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:33,839
and then you have to

00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:35,839
find someone who can actually change

00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:37,200
real things like change the shape of

00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:38,800
your teams in the shape of your

00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:42,240
organization

00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:45,599
so it's really a the challenges are

00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:47,839
our leadership and organization all the

00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:50,800
way work more than anything else

00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:53,359
i have the impression i wonder if this

00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:56,400
fits your experience

00:45:53,359 --> 00:46:00,079
that one problem is that

00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:03,520
people trying to think of a

00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:06,640
a polite way to say this

00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:09,599
oh go ahead with you know

00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:11,520
we're not so polite here in scandinavia

00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,160
american way i'll just blurp it out

00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:15,040
there

00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:17,440
is that sometimes and maybe i don't know

00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,880
if it's the individual engineer or the

00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,520
team lead or the

00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,079
people higher up in the organization but

00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,400
they

00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,599
hear about a new approach and they want

00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,119
they were

00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,880
they don't want to miss an opportunity

00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,000
they don't want to miss you know they

00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,599
don't want to be behind the curve

00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:34,640
they're trying to be competitive

00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:36,480
um but they sometimes approach this i

00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,480
mean even subconsciously

00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:39,839
by they want to keep their old

00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,640
assumptions

00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:44,160
so they're they don't because not that

00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,040
they're defending them they it's not

00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:47,359
even a question

00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,920
i mean they haven't realized that that's

00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:51,839
that's framing what they do and they say

00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,200
give me that new technology i'll buy

00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:54,839
that new technology

00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,240
and you know i work for a company that's

00:46:54,839 --> 00:47:00,720
selling

00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,720
software technology so you know yay but

00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:05,200
yeah i'm sorry i i know i'm

00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,280
contradicting your

00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,040
your agenda here but i would say don't

00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,280
buy any new technology

00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:12,480
because that's the thing that makes a

00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,760
difference

00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:17,839
well i do think the people who you

00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,800
even who who buy our wonderful

00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:21,040
technology

00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,839
we really see a difference in people and

00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,920
with this part of

00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:27,200
the the book that ted and i just did

00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:31,040
it's got like our 18 or 20 use cases

00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:32,960
talking about people who um

00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,960
don't just get this technologies because

00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,040
you do need some fundamental

00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,240
tools that give you the opportunity to

00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,400
democratize

00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,680
data and share and i mean then that's

00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,160
fundamentally what this

00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,119
this data fabric does but that people

00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,119
who

00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,400
the innovation needs to be not just the

00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,920
people who build the innovative

00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:53,119
technology

00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,839
innovation to work has to be do the

00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:57,040
people who

00:47:53,839 --> 00:48:00,559
use it do the users have vision and so

00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:02,960
do they see the possibilities do they

00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,599
change that style do they step back and

00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,520
say

00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:09,920
you know i've been accepting trade-offs

00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:11,599
that i'd you know i'm limited by my

00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,400
technology but i'm also limited by my

00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:17,520
worldview i'm not trying to build a

00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:20,240
uh what i call a comprehensive data

00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:24,000
strategy i think you've talked about a a

00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:28,640
a a data ops manifesto you know

00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:31,119
that people have to say

00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,920
i'm going to use this in a new way it's

00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:33,839
not just

00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,440
buy the tool and plug it in i mean they

00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:37,119
buy the tool plug it in they may get a

00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,640
little advantage but they're missing a

00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,079
huge opportunity

00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,680
if they haven't you know plugged

00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:44,800
themselves in

00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:46,720
and and basically said this

00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,720
there's a different way to do things i'm

00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:50,400
sorry now i ranted on my that was my

00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,319
soapbox about it

00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,599
it makes sense the this is very

00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:57,119
subconscious uh

00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:59,200
uh i find it's it's it's very rarely

00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:00,800
conscious decisions by the way i should

00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,359
give credit for the

00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,720
date ops manifesto is is written by the

00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:06,640
a company called data kitchen

00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,400
in boston who's they provide great

00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,920
resources on on date obviously

00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:13,440
thank you everybody's interested in

00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:16,000
reading more um

00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,760
so it's it's really subconsciously uh

00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,599
and i i'd like to correct my

00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,040
my statement earlier that that

00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,520
technology does matter

00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:25,440
in the sense that some technology

00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:28,160
affects the way that you work

00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,480
right it changes the way that you work

00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,319
and

00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,079
i brought up hadoop as an earlier

00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:33,359
example or something that transformed

00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:35,200
the way that we work

00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:36,480
but we weren't aware of it right it was

00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,720
completely subconscious

00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,760
and accidental so it was pure luck that

00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,200
somebody

00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:43,520
thought it would be fun to install a

00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,480
hadoop cluster in 2007 before there was

00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:47,520
any business

00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,000
idea what's uh or reason whatsoever well

00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:50,640
i just

00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:51,440
insert or technology may be limiting the

00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:53,599
way you

00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,440
i mean you do need the technology

00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:57,359
doesn't solve the problem

00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,200
but you do need to know if it's imposing

00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:01,040
limits that wouldn't let you do the

00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:04,079
kinds of approaches that you're

00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:06,160
you're going for and everything

00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:08,079
of this happens subconsciously right uh

00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,760
as one another enabling technology

00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:11,280
changes the way you work is the cloud of

00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:13,359
course because you don't have to go

00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:15,040
go and ask for machines and so forth

00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:16,319
anymore and that really changes the way

00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:19,359
you work

00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:21,760
and and in some ways it it does

00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:23,280
it's in a destructive way or maybe not

00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:26,079
appropriate for you like

00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,119
for example git and github has the

00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:29,839
popularization

00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:30,880
has made every company or lots of

00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:33,200
companies work

00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,800
like they were an open source project

00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,240
but the difference is that in an open

00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,040
source project you don't have trust

00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:39,839
between people

00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:41,200
so so suddenly companies work as if

00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:41,760
there were no trust between the

00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,559
different

00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,599
teams right and that's not necessarily a

00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:48,640
good thing

00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:51,520
no no so uh

00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:53,359
we have just a few minutes left i think

00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:56,800
a closing question for you

00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:58,160
is are there uh particular resources

00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,440
that you want to share

00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:03,839
or point people to uh i

00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:05,280
i'll make an offer on your behalf i'll

00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:07,200
tell you every conversation

00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,640
with lars i've ever had in my life i've

00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,720
come away

00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,720
really revved up learning something

00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:14,000
looking at things in a new way so i hope

00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,319
people will reach out

00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,040
and contact you but are there particular

00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:20,000
pointers

00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:21,839
either to actions approaches or some

00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:25,520
resources that you'd like to uh

00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:28,800
leave people with today so there are a

00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:31,760
couple of pointers first of all uh

00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,160
our marketing strategy is very simple we

00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,800
give

00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:36,640
away the knowledge and information for

00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,680
free and hope that it will be useful

00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,720
for someone thus if you go to our home

00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,280
page there's a

00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,760
link there called resources and you'll

00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,800
find

00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:49,359
a reading list for for data engineers

00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:51,520
with links and to presentations and

00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:53,599
articles and books and so forth

00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,440
and and all of my previous conference

00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:57,359
presentations are also there but

00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,520
i know that reading list is is fairly

00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:03,040
popular and appreciated

00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:05,680
um there are a couple of uh

00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,880
many links or many of the good resources

00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,240
are of course in that list

00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,920
but there are a couple of ones that i'd

00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,880
like to highlight i already mentioned

00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:13,920
data kitchen who

00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:16,960
is providing great resources uh

00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,000
there is a book by harwinger atwal i

00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,319
hope i got his name

00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,920
right on date ops and that is the best

00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:25,200
data ops

00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:28,160
book out there um there is

00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,640
also a great book by jesse anderson

00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:31,280
called

00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,000
data teams and if you're a leader and

00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,720
are interested

00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,520
in team formations and so forth jesse

00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:40,000
anderson who runs the big data institute

00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:41,200
is is the best resource on on those

00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,800
topics

00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:44,720
so i think those are the resources that

00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:47,359
come off the top of my head

00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,079
but if and if you forget them just reach

00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:51,280
out to me

00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:54,720
on twitter linkedin or you can find my

00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:58,720
uh some kind of mail on our home page

00:52:54,720 --> 00:53:00,000
so um i would with my clumsiness here

00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,920
i'm trying to put the

00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:04,800
link to and i'm going to see if i

00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,800
pronounce it correctly

00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:11,040
yes well i just found the resources uh

00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:12,720
reading list

00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,319
and i'm trying to put it into chat and

00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:16,000
for some reason it's not letting me

00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:17,680
add it to chat so i just stuck it in the

00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,440
questions i don't know if everyone can

00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:22,079
see this i hope so

00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,440
um but i think it's a hangout room

00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:25,920
afterwards or something so

00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,200

00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:31,040
