Description: 
	So your boss wants you to setup a multisources/multiformats search engine, and he thinks it requires 5 min to do so ? Well, the best we can do, is to show you what Datafari - an open source enterprise search solution - can (and cannot do) in 5 min, and then you will have more food to build a realistic scenario for your boss.

	00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,120
uh hello so

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,360
cedric i have now less than five minutes

00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,719
to tell you about data file and operates

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,400
enterprise search what you can and

00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,880
cannot do with the open source edition

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,720
so

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,400
i'm the ceo co-founder of france labs we

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,400
are the software maker behind

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,240
the tafari so first because i had a

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,480
question on linkedin what is enterprise

00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,000
search in the context of our talk here

00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,240
it's an enterprise search application

00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
that enables employees to find all the

00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,280
information that the company possesses

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,239
without the need to know where the

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,079
information is

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,160
stored and i added to this definition

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,440
securely and the definition comes from

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,760
the book of martin white called

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,520
enterprise search

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,280
so about translabs we'll skip that one

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,960
because we don't have time enterprise

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,879
how does that work lucian talked about

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,360
it a bit uh in his lighting tool so

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,559
i gained some time so before i go into

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,600
the canon cannot

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,199
let me to show you how you can if

00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,199
it's easy to install that actually

00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,760
community edition so you have your

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,280
linux console you type docker pool data

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,080
fairies slash data fairy

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,880
ce data free you enter well i cheated

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,000
because i already

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,000
downloaded it because it takes two

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,520
minutes and we have just five

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and then you just have to execute the

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,720
commands uh which is documented on our

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,360
docker hub

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,360
let me copy paste you do that um

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,720
okay and then it goes on but it takes

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,920
five to seven minutes so you have to

00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,400
trust me that it works

00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,920
and once it is deployed you access to

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,240
your user interface

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,600
on the web which is similar to this one

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,840
obviously there is nothing

00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:38,880
so you log in to manage your system

00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,560
okay now you go to domain and we will

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,159
add some data to your data very

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,280
community edition so this is part of the

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,920
things you can do

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,799
so it's a simplified mode uh let's index

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,200
our webpage

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,600
our website uh quickly seconds are

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,600
flying

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,119
so this is for vanity cat let's say it's

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,280
our website

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,240
i don't care and we start right away

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,000
okay and

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,799
while this is going on let's go back to

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,799
the presentation

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,039
so and i wanted full screen uh wait a

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,080
minute

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,319
shook and i click here yeah so

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,080
uh what you can do so you can you can

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,440
crawl multiple sources and multiple

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,040
formats because this is enterprise

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,800
search many systems to create so

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,400
this is do it feasible thanks to apache

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,160
manifold cf this is

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,840
led by cal wright where you can do your

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,360
indexing pipeline manage your time

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,000
windows the bandwidth of coding et

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,920
cetera

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,160
and also thanks to apache tikka led by

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,959
tim alison and this is about indexing as

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,200
many formats

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,080
as you can dream of and manage out of

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,840
memories for

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,120
strange figures for instance then it's

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,800
about searching um

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,560
mostly with bm25 because it's the

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,000
default search algorithm provided by

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,280
apache solar which we embed

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,280
we provide the front end which is

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,160
adjacent slabs and soon data for ui in

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,080
beta version

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,760
we provide internationalization you can

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,519
analyze because we embed also open

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,280
distro and soon open search we also

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,519
provide lots of logs that you can

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,519
dig into and also it's about management

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,680
so we provide user interface to manage

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,440
graphically your data ferry but you also

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,159
have the manifold cf admin ui and the

00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,280
solar

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,400
min ui what does it not allow you to do

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,319
because it's important to know what you

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,920
cannot do and again this is about not

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,760
easily managing because

00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,040
we don't prevent you to do all the

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,440
things i'm going to mention it's just

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,840
that

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,599
we provide it as the enterprise edition

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,040
that has a license cost because yeah we

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,599
need to convince you to pay for

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,000
something

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,519
so that we can survive and so what i'm

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,799
going to list here is not forbidden it's

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,239
just that you need to do build it by

00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,840
yourself so security

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,680
you have to build yourself the system to

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,200
manage the acl access control list

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,959
retrieval at indexing time

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,959
and how to connect to active directory

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,080
ldap for authorization authentication

00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,879
sso et cetera

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,440
when about managing big data so we

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,200
provide

00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,200
the enterprise edition install scripts

00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,720
to manage your clusters solar cloud

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,239
also to externalize components not such

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,120
many fold cf this you have to do by

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,640
yourself

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,080
restarting graphically data free

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,879
backuping data ferry this kind of

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,239
systems also

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,000
you have to do by yourself so much

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,280
mostly the production part many more but

00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,319
i don't have time but again we don't

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,080
prevent you to do it

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,680
we don't compile some components that we

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,799
hide how it works everything is very

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,840
transparent

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:09,519
so now if i go back to the demonstration

00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:12,879
uh which is somewhere somewhere here

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,720
and i go back to the search interface

00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,400
and it works so we have indexed things

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,000
and you can see typically this is you

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,079
have default facets you have the search

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,840
results you have preview mechanisms

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,840
you have advanced search you can save

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,120
your searches you have favorites etc all

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,040
this is provided

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,320
in the open source edition okay and in

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,400
the admin ui

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,840
you can do many things uh you can manage

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,199
uh promo links which are google like

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,000
google alerts you can protect your

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,759
single names

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,199
the field weights of bm25 all these

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:43,840
things are graphical and

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:43,840
here is a quick look of the next uh ui

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,440
so this will this is based on react and

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,040
you can embed it as a div

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,240
in in any framework you have as long as

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,840
you know how to use react we have

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,000
documented that

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,080
so that's it 16 seconds i really i am on

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,479
time i'm really proud of myself uh

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,199
i'm sure i can have some uploads so to

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,360
summarize to do everything start from

00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:05,360
datafile.com.html

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,800
user container it's easier if you're on

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,360
windows maybe you should use the vm

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,800
appliance but really containers for gigs

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,000
my time is over but i will take a few

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,199
seconds more

00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,880
lots of documentation is under

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,520
confidence that we provide like we have

00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,199
200 or 300 pages the code is on gitlab

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,280
and with a mirror on github

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,320
we have a twitter account a twitter tag

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,120
and with it

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,520
i'm done with just 15 seconds delay so

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,520
thank you

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,520
that's great thanks cedric uh yeah so i

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,280
was wondering if there's a flagship

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,720
deployment of data fari with a

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,840
particular use case that you could

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,840
briefly summarize

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,479
black sheep yeah i mean we we're moving

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,520
it's a three years project but we're

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,000
finalizing the

00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,800
the move into production for the the dga

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,360
which is a one

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,000
one one one element of the french army

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,840
so that's pretty

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,680
cool but it's the enterprise edition

00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,960
it's not a community edition

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,280
uh so yes sorry for the answer they kind

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,199
of wanted the part about security uh

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,639
surprisingly so yeah oh i see so you

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,240
can't talk about it you can't talk about

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,000
how great the product is for them

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,520
understood understood but um is there

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,960
perhaps another um

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,319
use case uh deployment that you're

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,680
particularly proud of that you could

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,360
share with us either of the enterprise

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,800
or the open source edition

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,240
it's mostly an enterprise because

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,240
surprisingly many of the open source

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,759
users don't say that they use it i don't

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,400
know why they are shy or something like

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,000
that but

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,039
i'm familiar with that problem sometimes

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,199
you've got to bribe them you know

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,680
t-shirts and hats seem to work for me

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,639
we tried the t-shirts but you know the

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,080
