Title: Elias Nema – Building Data-Intensive Teams
Publication date: 2021-06-29
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2021 #bbuzz
Description: 
	Nowadays, users expect your app to be not only fast and reliable but also smart. As a consequence, more and more teams are becoming data-intensive — relying on data to build their solutions. And it’s a common belief that putting models into production is one of the biggest bottlenecks in a journey of becoming more data-driven. While true, this step is only the beginning of the journey.

I believe that a much broader transformation is required in how we think about product development lifecycle as well as communication flows between business, engineering, and data. 
In this talk, I’ll show how we are building data-grounded solutions in the domain of search and recommendations and instilling an experimental culture in one of the biggest online marketplaces.

	00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,719
good good evening

00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,440
have a good day everybody around the

00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,360
globe

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,440
and uh yeah thank you very much for

00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,359
introducing me today i'm gonna

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,920
be talking about data intensive teams uh

00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:23,039
whatever that means hopefully we'll also

00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,840
uh be able to understand it

00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,359
uh so basically i'm uh working at the

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,640
olex group and leading search and

00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,160
recommendations there

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,920
and alex group for those of you who

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,520
don't know uh this is an online

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,280
marketplace that is present in

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,000
more than 25 countries with more than

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,800
350 million

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,280
most active users uh the biggest company

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,440
they

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,399
uh that you don't know they say on the

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,120
internet

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,480
so uh but yeah recently actually you

00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,640
might have heard of us

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,239
because our parent company process have

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,559
bought stack overflow

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,160
and decreasing new so maybe we will also

00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,600
be

00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:04,159
more visible right now but today

00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,240
it's uh not really not really about

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,320
business but about data

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,680
and uh to start talking about data

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,720
intensive teams

00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,000
i'd like to start by by

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,880
first trying to understand the term data

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,759
intensive and

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,640
it was actually coined by uh martin

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,439
klepman like

00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,119
five six months already seven years ago

00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,600
uh when he wrote his

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,640
amazing book designing data intensive

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,560
applications

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,240
uh highly recommended but i mean of

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,079
course uh

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,280
many of you have uh probably already

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,400
heard about it and

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,960
doesn't need introduction uh so

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,840
he writes that an application is data

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,399
intensive if

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,040
data is its primary challenge the

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:47,520
quality

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,280
the complexity the speed so like

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,560
basically everything

00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,479
around the data is a challenge that

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,680
means that it's a data intensive

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,799
application

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,680
and uh he in

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,040
in his book he basically talks quite a

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,360
lot about the history

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,799
of uh how we ended up with data

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,640
intensive applications

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,280
uh from the technological point of view

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,840
like quite quite a fascinating read but

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,879
today like zooming out a little bit and

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,200
today

00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,000
really trying to understand and to debug

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,560
these

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,080
teams that are working on this data

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,959
intensive application so

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,480
if uh an application is intensive if if

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,400
it deals with data that means that

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,560
teams that are building this and running

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,519
this data intensive application

00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,959
uh and managing data products are the

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,120
data intensive teams

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:40,080
and so how do we cook these teams how do

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,519
we

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:46,160
deal with these teams how do we

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,560
do like the best practices dealing with

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,560
this

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,720
data intensive applications in the teams

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,959
to learn how to do it

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,000
we actually need to also go a little bit

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,040
back and to see

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,840
the history of of the development of

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,040
basically applications and data

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,159
applications

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:06,959
and going back

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,840
like 40 years uh let's say i want to

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,680
bring you to

00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,000
two seminal papers uh on the left

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,599
in the left corner uh you see the unix

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,840
time sharing system

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,680
which is like a seminal paper that

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,200
introduced the unix

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:26,080
system in 1974

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,040
on the right you see system r which

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,159
actually

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,720
introduced the first relational database

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,760
that has

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,239
influenced almost all the existing

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,120
relational and then non-relational also

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,879
databases

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,799
and introduced so many concepts that

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:44,440
were reused

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:47,120
later on and uh it was introduced in

00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,760
1976 but the interesting part is

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,480
it's actually like very very similar so

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,879
basically

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,920
both of them were information management

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,720
systems

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,840
uh and they have like different

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,159
approaches though so for example

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:05,360
operation operating systems viewed

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,760
its role as presenting hardware to

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,239
computer programmers while actually

00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,120
database management system dbms

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,720
got its role as managing data for

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,799
application programmers so

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,720
taking a bit of a higher level of

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,720
abstraction and then

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,720
dealing with all the complexity of the

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,520
data and hiding it behind so that

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,240
you can do the select star and then it

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,639
will return

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,800
the data to you while you will not need

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:32,960
to manage pointers and and

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,240
just search uh for the data in different

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,680
places

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,440
and you can you can say that uh the unix

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,400
approach was more of a

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,240
toolbox approach so basically giving the

00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,960
pay a

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,000
box of tools to developers so that they

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,240
can

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,160
build things themselves while actually

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,280
system r approach was more of a

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:58,000
closed box approach uh where

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,440
you you put something in a box and then

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,479
you query to get the

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,639
result without uh like doing

00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,600
too too much complexity on top of that

00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,720
so and

00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,120
and this world's coexisted really really

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,680
well

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,320
in this state however there was a kind

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,280
of a

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,520
dwelling wall between them uh and and

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,400
these communities have developed

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,199
maybe unnecessarily uh far from each

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,759
other

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:29,120
uh but yeah it all coexisted well until

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:32,800
the internet until the internet happened

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:36,000
this is a mosaic browser the beautiful

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,199
uh back then uh browser now now looks

00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,560
retro of course

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:43,280
uh still it was the first bird

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,639
uh that that kind of trained people to

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,080
desire more

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,039
from the internet to desire uh images to

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,320
desire

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:56,319
some fancy websites these are links

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:59,199
and and then this all of course was fine

00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,880
back in the mosaic era but then internet

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,840
started spread

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:07,840
uh and like a spread around the globe

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:10,720
and finally

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,759
the the poor box wasn't able to handle

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,720
this anymore

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,400
so basically uh what was happening in

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,600
90s and 2000s

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:22,319
that actually this boxes like

00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,120
as always closed box cannot be easily

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,440
extended

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,840
right so but but the good part of that

00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,199
is that actually at the first time these

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,919
two communities

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,919
of application developers and database

00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:38,880
developers were starting to come

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,440
together and so basically during these

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,319
times

00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,600
people starting using tools to actually

00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,199
decompose the box

00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,919
and introduce many many uh

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,599
standardized and open tools it it

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,639
brought the beginning of whole

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:57,759
no sequel but then which converts to

00:06:54,639 --> 00:07:00,639
new sql like there is something really

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,120
really magical about the sql language uh

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,960
so that

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,120
all the new nosql databases are

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,680
implementing sql interfaces right now

00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,280
but

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,960
yeah this is a different conversation

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,160
but it brought like this

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:15,120
this really pieces of this box

00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,479
that we're doing one particular thing uh

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,199
for example

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,800
database internal transactional log was

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,360
was brought into kafka

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,599
and and this is uh you can use with with

00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,240
all the many data sources right now

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,039
and uh one of the benefits there was

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,280
also

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,039
uh open source in the file format for

00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,120
example avro parking

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,639
these are right now industry standards

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,199
as opposed to

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,080
uh like this closed systems of like

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,840
oracle

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,160
sql server that had their own

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,039
proprietary

00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,400
data standards it wasn't easy to get

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,000
data in and out

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,319
so basically this is uh what happened

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,520
from the technological perspective and

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,400
i'm super

00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,800
pleased that that happened and and this

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,240
kind of

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,319
merge of these two paradigms happened

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,160
and uh application developers and

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,879
database developers started working

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,280
closer together it didn't happen like uh

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,280
uh

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,840
in a fairy tale of course there was lots

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,960
of hey we're implementing uh

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,039
the flat tire approach and then all the

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,240
old systems are uses but then at the end

00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,840
what we came up with

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,160
is is really great great tool of

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:27,280
technologies but what was happening

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,440
on the consumer side which is uh

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,680
also also super interesting you can see

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:35,039
the netflix website for example

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,440
uh 20 years ago on the left and then

00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,640
right now on the right and and you can

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,440
see that

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,440
actually well there were images before

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,279
now you also see images

00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:50,320
uh but it's definitely

00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:53,680
couldn't be more different but uh

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,600
like conceptually not that

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,720
unless you start looking into details

00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,760
right

00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,959
so you can see that all the styles that

00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,480
you see here

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:07,839
are actually ranked for you then you see

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,560
the ranking by location by your location

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,600
where you are

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,360
in right now and then you also have this

00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,560
personalized lanes

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,040
and then in each of the lanes you even

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,279
have

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,080
personalized images from the movie so

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,360
that

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:24,000
netflix find the best match of the image

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,160
for you

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,200
for each of the movies this is this is

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,600
insane so

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,880
uh where i'm heading here is that

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,839
actually

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,480
or every lane here all the website here

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,120
is

00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,240
is literally a data product like every

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,080
piece of their website

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,279
is a data product and somehow you need

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,279
to uh do it and you need to display it

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,720
and to show to the user in a proper

00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,959
order uh

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,000
another example is amazon amazon 20

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,000
years ago on amazon

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,880
20 years uh amazon of today uh is uh

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,360
is very different and uh you can see

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,880
actually

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,279
on the left uh that i don't know if they

00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,640
has

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:07,360
much less information

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,000
like it has much bigger images much more

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,680
visuals

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,200
well you can say this is it's more

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,279
fashionable or something

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,040
but then on the other hand for example

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,000
you don't even they don't even show your

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,360
catalog

00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,920
uh like a categories that they have

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,640
because they now rely much more on

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,360
search

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,560
and this is the thing so uh like

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,000
expectations

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,920
user expectations if 20 years ago

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,360
it was expected for you to to go to the

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,839
website and then to

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,880
to search for something to dig deeper

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,760
into

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,480
into the information right now it's it's

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,560
not like that

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:46,399
right now it's expected uh from you to

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,839
to go to the website and see something

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,839
that is relevant to you

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,839
so you expect the site or the

00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,160
application the software product

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,760
not to be only functional but actually

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,399
to be very smart about

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,200
what to show you what to display and

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,079
imagine that

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,000
netflix wouldn't show me uh like

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,480
recommendations for myself but

00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,640
would show like i don't know uh their

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,279
catalog in alphabetical order

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,880
so this would be a little bit uh crazy

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,079
same for amazon for example you enter

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,640
and then you see like hey

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,320
all the all the products also basically

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,000
like yeah this this doesn't make sense

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,760
it doesn't scale but then

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,240
uh this this is what happened during

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,200
this year so information abundance

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,480
and this is what we expect right now is

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,279
users so that

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,760
applications are actually smart and how

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:37,600
do we build these smart applications

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,279
and uh yeah like usually generally

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,920
there are two things that we need to

00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,160
consider to kind of pain point here is

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,079
that

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,240
usually they require larger development

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,399
investment which is obvious because

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,279
i mean building data application itself

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,360
is more

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,440
uh costly just because you need to

00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,160
manage data you need to manage state

00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,399
uh it's costlier to build stateful

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,240
obligations rather than stateless right

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,760
uh but then the second one is probably

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,079
like even harder

00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,279
to tackle because uh it brings

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,920
uncertainty

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,399
on this return on investment and then uh

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,440
let me

00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:14,079
let me demonstrate this uh so for

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,800
for the costs for example this is this

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,079
is uh

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:21,360
the data from the facebook's paper

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:23,839
where they say that actually 80

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,040
of the ai inference cycles goes for

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,839
recommendations

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,120
so one single application of data

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,160
recommendations

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,399
is taking 80 of inference cycles

00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,160
which is like uh just you can think

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,040
about this as cost for their

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,760
ai investment goes for recommendations

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,120
which is

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:46,000
quite crazy it's uh it's a lot of money

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,440
but then uncertainty of results is even

00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,399
trickier

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,680
and i have a very very interesting use

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,959
case from bing

00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:58,399
here um and for example

00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:00,560
on the left uh you can see

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,079
the before and after of the bing search

00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,880
for example you search for flowers and

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,399
then

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,079
 is making money of course from

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,639
showing the ads

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,480
to you and then you have some ads that

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,600
are promoted on top

00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:16,720
and then you see the description uh

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,680
on the first line uh under

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,000
the link and then in the experiment they

00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,680
actually

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,920
decided to take this first line of

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,600
description and put it into the link

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:29,360
okay so basically uh it's really hard to

00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,079
evaluate an idea like that it thinks

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,519
like

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,399
uh it might bring some positive results

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,639
it might not like

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,240
you never know by the way this example

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,279
is coming from amazing book uh

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,959
trustworthiness line

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,560
controlled experiments there is a link

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,199
there highly recommended

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,680
but so just guess for yourself uh

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,760
because

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,040
we're all uh online right now just guess

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,040
for yourself like

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,800
how how much do you think this idea will

00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:55,680
bring uh with

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,079
such a small front-end change and i will

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,800
not

00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,519
keep you for long this idea alone

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,720
brought

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:06,560
more than 100 million dollars per year

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:08,240
to bing uh which is crazy like it's

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,480
it's insane amount of money and of

00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,519
course like bing is a huge company

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,760
and uh earns a lot of money but

00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,600
but the thing is that it probably took a

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,399
couple of days of development time

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,240
to develop such an idea and then the

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,920
return on this investment

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:29,040
was just staggering and

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,199
and if you think like that uh

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,880
this is this is the idea that took two

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,000
days to implement and and brought huge

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,279
result and then

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,519
the uh the big uh for example

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,720
recommendation systems that are deployed

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,399
on at scale

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,240
and require like machine learning

00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:47,199
platform and so on so

00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,040
so you don't want to go into any of the

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,399
extremes here you don't want to develop

00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,000
only fancy

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:56,639
complicated systems that are built

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
for for ages or you also don't want to

00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,920
do only the small

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,279
changes you want to go in both

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,320
directions

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:08,000
and if you if you go also on the

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,800
source of truth uh for many of us

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,079
uh which is twitter uh and you see like

00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,880
many of the

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,600
much much more important figures in tech

00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,920
are saying

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,720
the same thing that it's really scary to

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,680
spend

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,399
uh six to 12 months perfecting something

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,519
and then

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:28,639
uh building the wrong thing and then uh

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:31,040
steven sinovsky also says that uh the

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,920
dreaming goods to market is costly

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,680
but before now like we we didn't really

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,600
know how much of that cost was

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,720
trying to guess if it was the right

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,880
thing uh

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,040
to build because the change was

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,199
impossible and now

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,040
uh we are actually in a phase where

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,639
change is very much possible so

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,800
if you think about this typical

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,399
development flow of like really really

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,360
zoomed out development flow

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,000
it has ideas and it has implementations

00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,160
right

00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,120
uh so you start with an idea you

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,560
implement something

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,880
and then uh like it either works or not

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,399
and uh right now for for this modern

00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:10,000
products for this modern

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:12,800
uh applications it really doesn't make

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,279
much sense because here success doesn't

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,839
depend

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,360
only on the code quality on the system

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,839
quality so basically

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,880
it your your success of your idea

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,880
doesn't depend

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,639
on the quality of the implementation

00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,279
only as you have seen

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,480
uh in in the previous bing example it's

00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:31,199
literally

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,800
small ideas can have huge impact and

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,000
then it also optimizes for the wrong

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,880
metrics that

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,360
user is actually being included into the

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,079
loop

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,360
very very late right now right now i

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,560
want you to pay attention because i'm

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,320
bringing two of my

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,560
friends here to solve this problem

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,079
basically i'm bringing as a chameleon

00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,279
and an elephant as chameleon

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:56,000
will represent their volatile uh

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,040
idea space and then elephant will

00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,600
represent of course

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,040
uh implementation phase uh we start with

00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,920
this idea

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,600
and uh we we decompose basically the

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,720
idea into many steps

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:12,480
we start with the hypothesis uh because

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,720
it doesn't have certainty in it the idea

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,919
can be good can be bad implies judgment

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,720
you don't want to be an author

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,079
of a bad idea right but uh also there

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,480
are like different

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,720
uh ways to call it a user story which

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,360
which presumes that we know our users

00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,559
and i highly recommend the twitter

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,559
account

00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,240
about user stories there is also a link

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:36,000
there

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:39,120
it has lots of fun parodies

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,600
on on user stories so cool

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,960
uh we we take the hypothesis and what do

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,000
we do with the hypothesis

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:50,240
we try to do the prototype of it

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:53,600
and the the kind of important thing here

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,240
is that we always build it as fast as

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,640
possible

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,320
and we decompose to the minimum effort

00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,120
to test our assumptions my favorite

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,440
example

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:07,200
is a yandex navigator with kind of uh

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,200
analog of google maps

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:13,280
in in russia so you can see on the left

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,120
frozen literally has a metal rod to

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,080
which he put stickies

00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,520
and then he put his collec in a car and

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,760
then he started driving like

00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,120
hey and then whenever the time is right

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,919
he wants to test

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,240
if some pop-up in the application will

00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,240
be useful for the user or not and of

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,720
course of course it's not

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,039
the same as building it into the code

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:38,080
and displaying it on in the app

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,760
for sure not but then to implement it

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,520
into the code it will take a couple of

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,919
months and then to release it

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,280
and then to uh like see the user

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,600
feedback it will take

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,720
at least like a three four months right

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,840
in here you can just

00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,880
take it in in hours and this is this is

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,799
what we're aiming for

00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,799
we are aiming for collecting the

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,600
feedback and and this example is also

00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,280
great because

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,640
you're you're not only prototyping

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,520
you're also collecting the feedback from

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,799
the person

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:08,000
in real time by just driving with him

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,799
uh so and this brings us here to this

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,840
next stage

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:13,600
where we actually want to uh

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,880
go to the real world and collect this

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,640
feedback so basically

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,120
we don't want to build a prototype and

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,960
then to to productionize it no we want

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,720
to launch an experiment with it

00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,160
it can be a b test but then it can be

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,799
also as you just

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,160
saw in the previous example uh just just

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,760
testing it with your colleagues with

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:32,640
your friends with your family

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,240
and the main ideas here is to avoid

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,720
costly mistakes right

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,240
uh like because you're not developing

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,120
something that is

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,559
not gonna fly from the very first test

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,440
uh right

00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,480
and then finally we got to our elephant

00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,120
where we can

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,840
go all in on the implementation once we

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,880
collected all the data that we have

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,720
before and uh

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,400
yeah like or actually we can go for

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,200
another hypothesis and

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,880
let me show you uh for example imagine

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,360
that prototype or experiment has shown

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,880
that

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,640
okay it's not enough uh return on the

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,480
investment uh or like

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,080
the prototype has shown that yeah the

00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:12,640
idea doesn't actually make

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,400
much sense at all so we we just go and

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,799
adjust our hypothesis so we don't need

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,679
to

00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,880
go full production uh and this is the

00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,960
beauty of uh

00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,000
of the system so that basically you can

00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,480
short circuit

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,039
and you can see the potential savings

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,240
are

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,480
quite huge here and your time to value

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,280
is

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,320
maximized to that and actually it's even

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,960
more because

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,600
each of the following steps usually is

00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,640
bigger

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,840
than the previous ones so i can

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,559
potentially save

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,120
even more and uh like this is uh you

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:46,480
know like

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:49,039
the silicon valley jargon of hey like a

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,880
yeah yeah or not an entrepreneur until

00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,880
you failed and and this is taken

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,120
up to extreme there of course but then

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,360
there is something there right because

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,240
basically this lowers the variance of

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,640
the outcome

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,320
uh because you're converging to a

00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,840
working solution faster you

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,080
like you see something is not working

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,760
you're not uh

00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,440
insisting on that you're trying

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,559
different things and you're investing

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,919
into something that

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:17,440
is working so to recap chameleon

00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,880
uh to make him green have a constant

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,559
flow hypothesis

00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,080
minimize investment into your first

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:25,520
prototype collect

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:27,440
feedback from real users and only invest

00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:31,440
into something that has proven

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:34,559
uh its initial potential so chameleon

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,360
is about moving fast right what's wrong

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,400
with

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,320
moving fast only right we can ask a

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,640
person who knows a thing or two

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,720
about moving fast and breaking things

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,080
and facebook's motto was actually more

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,559
fast and great things

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,400
but not many people know that a couple

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:53,679
of years ago it was actually changed

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:57,440
to move fast with stable infrastructure

00:21:53,679 --> 00:22:00,559
and uh yeah if circa is not a

00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,720
big of a figure for that for you i'm

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,919
considering going into the football

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,760
pitch and

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,280
let's let's learn uh something from

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,520
there uh

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,559
i want to refer one of my favorite

00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,760
coaches

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,159
uh thomas tuchel uh and and if you don't

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,919
know

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,600
who he is let me just show you in a

00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:21,360
couple of slides okay but

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:24,480
uh he's he's a famous football coach

00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,360
and he just won uh the champions league

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,520
with chelsea

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:32,640
so uh but yeah but uh look here

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,159
so this is uh he's potentially the most

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,440
expensive player in the world he's a

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,720
great attacker

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,000
uh playing for uh psg and praying

00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:43,120
playing for france

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,400
uh great footballer and this is thomas

00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,799
tuchel so

00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,159
a person who is not afraid to do things

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,200
like that to the most expensive

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,960
footballer

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:56,320
uh is really worth listening to at least

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,720
so the quote we provide

00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,679
those attacking patterns and show them

00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,679
on video

00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,760
but we don't practice them much we

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,640
almost exclusively

00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,480
concentrate on our defensive movements

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,159
in training

00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:13,120
so again like this is at first when i

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,360
when i've heard that

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,480
read that it didn't make much sense to

00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,840
me but then it

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,679
kind of really really because i

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,880
translated it into into

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:27,760
our work so basically

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,320
not to be afraid to experiment in attack

00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,799
so

00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,360
exploring our new opportunities like

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,559
going

00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,360
full chameleon you need to have your

00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:38,480
defense

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:41,039
solved so basically infrastructure knobs

00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,320
needs to be stable and operational so

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:46,320
that you can go

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:48,080
and experiment and and of course

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,159
you still you still start with

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,679
experimenting like you still start with

00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,960
something that makes sense

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:58,960
you still start with exploration right

00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:01,679
um for example like if you imagine

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,480
uh or if you remember like this netflix

00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,760
example

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:08,080
uh from the above where we we saw

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,400
the most popular movies in the location

00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:13,520
where i am

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,360
so it doesn't require a

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,880
sophisticated machine learning model

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,919
from the beginning right

00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,720
start with a sql query but

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,000
go through the full cycle meaning get

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,240
user feedback

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,760
uh and then like while you'll be

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,200
implementing this you'll learn

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:33,440
so many uh hacks that you have to do

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,720
you'll learn so many components that are

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,679
missing in your system

00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,120
you learn so much about monitoring that

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,400
needs to be added and

00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:45,840
and tracking and things like

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,440
uh infrastructure things like operations

00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,480
you learn all of that

00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,640
by just implementing a simple sql query

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,159
but getting the input and then putting

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,039
the output to the user and collecting

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,520
the feedback from

00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:01,039
them you also know what's force

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:04,400
investment and what's not uh

00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,400
and basically

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,120
when you are ready like when you have

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,039
something that is

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,039
running and you've built a couple of

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:16,559
applications like that

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:20,000
uh think 10x right

00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:22,320
uh write your applications write your

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,840
system so that they can grow

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:29,919
a one uh basically

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:33,039
uh one

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,880
uh uh what like 10 times

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,720
that you can scale them so 10 is a

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,919
magical empirical number

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,400
mentioned often in the industry and then

00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:46,400
basically you want to build systems that

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,400
survive this one magnitude of growth

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,799
and then when you're it will take time

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,880
to build the system it will take time to

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,320
build this foundational layer

00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,080
but then you don't need to stop

00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,360
experimenting at the same time you can

00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,000
continue

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:02,480
grasping this low-hanging fruits

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,799
experimenting with smaller things

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,159
and hopefully by the time that you

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,640
implement

00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,840
your foundational layer you have already

00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,400
seen

00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,440
that you have from your experimentation

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,440
that will require

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,960
your foundational layer to grow even

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,240
more right

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,320
so and you already invest into another

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,200
order of magnitude of growth

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,600
and then again like this all will come

00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,240
from

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,600
real requirements from real users that

00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,159
you'll be serving

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,760
and you will not be building uh

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,919
something just because

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,120
facebook or or google has built it you

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,559
will not be building

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,200
feature stores you will not be building

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:43,039
machine learning platforms

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,679
you will if you will need and if you

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:48,240
will grow to that and hopefully you will

00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:50,400
but you will not start with that you

00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,440
will not start implementing the whole

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,159
system from the beginning not knowing if

00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,720
it's good for

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,520
your users not somebody else's users but

00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,520
your users

00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:05,440
and hopefully uh with this one you can

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,640
scale and scale and go

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,120
to the infinity and beyond and you can

00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,240
start

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:15,120
reinventing yourself you can

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,559
pivot when the time comes and you can

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,600
learn to experiment and

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:22,799
cross the easy leaves

00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,600
and also the like build the great

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:27,760
engineering

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:30,640
systems so to recap the elephant

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,840
uh we have our infrastructure and

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,600
operations

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,960
as the most important things for the

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,760
innovation this is like a

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,520
counterintuitive thought as as an

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,840
example from thomas tuchel that

00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,600
you think about defense if you want to

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,240
go to the attack

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,640
uh also build systems that survive at

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,000
least

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:53,679
an order of my negative growth because

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,880
if you basically build more

00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:59,600
then you're wasting the investment

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,559
if you build less then you'll need to

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,480
rebuild

00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,240
too often so that you don't want to do

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,279
that and then

00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,320
build only for your needs and when those

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,880
need arise

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,720
from your experimentation from your

00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,919
iterations on the platform from your

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,600
learnings

00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:20,399
from your software and with this one

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,600
thank you very much i hope this tactics

00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:24,240
can help you

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,880
uh to marry your chameleon and an

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,039
elephant

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,640
and uh let's keep the conversation you

00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:33,760
can find me on twitter or

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,760
on linkedin or anywhere else thank you

00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,000
thank you so much for that elias that

00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:43,360
was very interesting

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:48,320
um i really like your approach of just

00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:50,240
being experimental with these kinds of

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,679
changes that you want to bring about to

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,919
your solutions to

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,440
start the process of seeing what works

00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:58,240
and what doesn't

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,640
for a company that doesn't have let's

00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,520
say

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,919
some baseline measurements or doesn't

00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:06,240
even know where to start

00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,080
in terms of what to measure are there

00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,520
any kind of

00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,200
rules or best practices you might have

00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,120
so let's say someone wants to start on

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,039
this journey but doesn't know how to

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,720
compare it as they start doing this type

00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,720
of prototyping

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,640
do you have any kind of advice for how

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,840
to formulate what kind of things that

00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:27,120
they should be looking for

00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:29,120
as they start this process yeah that's

00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,360
that's a great question and uh

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,320
i think that the most important thing is

00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,159
not to

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,600
especially from the beginning not to

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,840
look into

00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,279
like many other examples but actually

00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:42,320
start from your

00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:45,279
uh initial idea and from your

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,840
uh like desired point of where you want

00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,000
to be

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,960
and then like build things for yourself

00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,679
don't look at

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,919
the state of the art don't look at uh

00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,840
what's being built in big corporations

00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:58,159
like just just start for yourself

00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,120
try to figure out things as you go and

00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,720
then like

00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:05,279
but but yeah again like don't don't uh

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,200
do it uh for for developers for your own

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,720
like put put it out for the user and

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,720
collect their feedback and

00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,080
and from their own like incorporating

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,120
this one uh

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,880
you can go forward like you can yeah

00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,480
you can continuously iterate all day

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,960
long but as long as you

00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,520
you you're not bringing the users then

00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,600
your like

00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,279
iterations are worthless basically so

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,320
like bring the user

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:31,039
uh learn from from the user uh make your

00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,240
product better for your users because

00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:34,720
yeah honestly like

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,200
you can have uh very very different

00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:41,600
users with facebook with amazon with

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:43,919
everybody else and uh hopefully you do

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,000
that's a great point um i have a

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:49,120
follow-up question to that

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:52,640
which is um how do you go about

00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,880
things that are hard to measure so

00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,679
this is kind of a little off the path

00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,919
here but

00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,600
coming from developer relations that's

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,480
kind of the biggest problem we have

00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,799
right is

00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,200
how do you measure things that are

00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:07,279
meaningful or impactful how do you

00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,279
measure things that are hard to measure

00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,080
and i was wondering if you had any type

00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,960
of

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,480
advice that is in this realm because i'm

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,640
sure there's some things that as you're

00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,720
prototyping you're like well how do we

00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,600
you know accurately measure something

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,840
that is hard to measure

00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,720
yeah i think this is this is a great

00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:28,799
great question

00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:32,080
as well because straight to the point

00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,440
we as humans have a tendency of uh like

00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,519
whenever we collect

00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,559
their test results or any data

00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,480
whatsoever

00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,799
whenever the data is proven that we are

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,399
good we're like hey yeah this is great

00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,080
whenever the data shows that something

00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,360
is bad we're like no no we need to

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:48,480
investigate that this is like

00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:52,640
this is a super common bias where we

00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:55,760
actually underestimate the potential

00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,679
like flows in our uh thinking so i think

00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:01,200
that the most important

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:04,159
uh like in in this unmeasurable uh

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,039
metrics is is to constantly try to

00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,919
challenge yourself

00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:10,240
constantly trying to see hey is it

00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,240
something

00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,760
to prove myself or actually to make

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,039
something better for the users

00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,600
to make something better for the

00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,080
customer so really always asking this

00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,600
question

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,960
and then not not stopping to ask this

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,039
like basically

00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,320
collecting the feedback from the users

00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,799
uh incorporating

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,799
their real feedback from uh like from

00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:35,440
forums from the applications from the

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,399
internet uh just the fishing for this

00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,039
feedback

00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:40,799
not being uh not not trying to find the

00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,360
good feedback and just stopping on that

00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,360
you know

00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,120
but actually trying to fish for all the

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,840
kind of diverse feedback from all the

00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:50,640
kind of

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:53,120
diverse uh platforms and then yeah

00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,399
wonderful i agree with that it's just

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,960
it's very difficult

00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,640
when you apply these things to certain

00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,279
industries and i completely agree with

00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,039
you about the

00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,440
the bias right there's even the others

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:05,360
where it's like throw away the data if

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,840
it doesn't agree with what you want it

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,519
to say

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:12,320
right yeah unfortunately

00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,200
yeah let me just double check and then

00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,519
also

00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,559
yeah go ahead yeah sorry uh yeah so

00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:20,480
basically it's like

00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:24,399
whenever you have some data always uh

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:26,640
try to

00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,919
try to yeah negate it like try to think

00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,760
like what what might have

00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,760
gone wrong when you when you were

00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:35,039
collecting it not try to

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:37,039
sell it first that's a

00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,080
that's also a really good point thanks

00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:41,919
for that

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:44,159
um i think we'll have a few more minutes

00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,679
if there's i know you had some really

00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:49,200
good resources in

00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:52,159
your slides are there any other pieces

00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,640
of resources either books or websites

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,640
that

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,840
you may want to share if people are

00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,279
interested in learning more

00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,320
aside from the really good book

00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:03,679
recommendations you've already shown

00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:04,880
yeah i think that i i can share many but

00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,720
related to this talk

00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,560
like a two two books uh that i was

00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,520
sharing there like trustworthy online

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,760
experiments

00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,200
and uh data in this application so i

00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,679
think these are like

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,720
very much related uh to to what i was

00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,960
talking about so

00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:35,839
i'll share like the presentation later

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:35,839
and there are links to these books there

00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,919
