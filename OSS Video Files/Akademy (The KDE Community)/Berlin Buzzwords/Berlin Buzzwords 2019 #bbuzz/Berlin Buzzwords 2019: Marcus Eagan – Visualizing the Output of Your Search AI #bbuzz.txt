Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2019: Marcus Eagan – Visualizing the Output of Your Search AI #bbuzz
Publication date: 2019-06-28
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2019 #bbuzz
Description: 
	If you have ever searched for “swimsuit" on an ecommerce store and were shown a row of snow boots as products that "customers frequently bought with,” you have witnessed one instance where AI will fail for a long time without  human guidance and intervention. Artificial Intelligence, without human oversight, will fail extraordinarily.

One problem with visualizing artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning, is often the deep knowledge of mathematics needed to understand the language of its output. I will offer you a technical strategy and solution for visualizing your AI, outside of purely technical context, and in a way that is consumable by team members throughout the organization and quick to implement. 

Your business needs to deploy AI, or it will lag behind competition and lose market share until it dies. But your AI needs an audit trail. Through the use of open source visualization tools, you can transform complex mathematical data, like word vectors used in collaborative filtering for ecommerce, to ensure that your AI is one you can rely on and trust.

okay hi everybody my name is Marcus Egan

00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:16,820
I work at

00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:20,960
works where I lead the developer

00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:26,779
relations we're working hard to bridge

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:30,829
the gap between developers and Apache

00:00:26,779 --> 00:00:33,130
Solr Lucene spark and a host of other

00:00:30,829 --> 00:00:35,920
open source technologies as well as our

00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:39,410
proprietary offerings so that people

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,710
know how to use them and can build upon

00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:44,329
them and extend them I'm hoping that my

00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:47,990
talk from today

00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:53,060
maybe introduces you to a new open

00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:55,820
source project and inspires you to to

00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,410
try out some of our prop some of our

00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,970
products and some of the open source

00:00:57,410 --> 00:01:06,740
tools that we use so you can build

00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:14,450
something better but so that everybody

00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:18,680
knows what we're going to discuss there

00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:25,250
it is how solar spark tensorflow

00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:28,610
and super set made me money and you know

00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:31,940
I'm not really much of a gambler I

00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:38,650
consider investing in the stock market

00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:41,150
you know much more risky than then say

00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:44,270
working at a loose it works for options

00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:49,580
you know like I just don't I'm not

00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:56,270
really big on gambling however here's

00:01:49,580 --> 00:02:01,520
why you should pay attention so I built

00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:03,200
a search app that used analyst data oh

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,020
by the way feel free to take any

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,409
pictures tweet out as much as you want

00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:11,480
to I don't care about any of this this

00:02:09,409 --> 00:02:13,430
is this was this was an experiment that

00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:20,470
I was willing to take to really force

00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:20,470
myself to be invested in this project so

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:30,030
I built a search app that you'll see

00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:36,840
pretty shortly here that that helped me

00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:40,980
realize a 48 percent return on my $8,000

00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:43,620
of gambling which I was very nervous

00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:47,939
about and had a lot of anxiety because

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:51,290
it's not my thing but the search app was

00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:55,260
to summarize it was powered by

00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:58,109
tensorflow it was it used convolutional

00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,449
neural networks to classify documents

00:02:58,109 --> 00:03:03,090
and an index pipeline so we were

00:03:00,449 --> 00:03:06,810
ingesting data and adding a field that

00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:09,629
was a predicted value and it the the

00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:12,269
interesting thing about it I'll get into

00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:14,040
later was this is sort of an

00:03:12,269 --> 00:03:18,000
introductory it's like the interesting

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:22,500
thing about is like the the model that

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:26,489
we built was not built for financial

00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:28,290
analyst sentiment gauge we didn't where

00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:30,449
that's outside of my realm of expertise

00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:32,310
it was it would have been very

00:03:30,449 --> 00:03:36,840
cumbersome and expensive and taken a

00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:38,459
long time so this is also maybe an

00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:43,799
introduction for some more exploration

00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:46,139
in the realm of transfer learning taking

00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,780
learnings from one domain or one

00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:51,750
exercise and applying them to another

00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:55,530
and and I think we had I think that was

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:58,470
a big part of our success is because but

00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:04,939
I don't know anything about gambling or

00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:10,280
investing in stocks so this is what the

00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:13,889
so over the same period this is what the

00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:15,870
S&P 500 has done and the United States

00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:19,139
so they say like if you just invest in

00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:22,349
indexes more or less you'll beat you'll

00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:24,719
beat all the big name investors like

00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:28,409
index always wins or nine times out of

00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:29,300
ten it'll be and I say if you use

00:04:28,409 --> 00:04:32,639
tensorflow

00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:34,800
you'll beat the indexes so indexes beat

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,539
the best investors tensorflow beats the

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:43,139
indexes

00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:45,270
and for a little comparison that's but

00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:46,590
you know I don't want to spend too much

00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:49,130
time on that because it's not about the

00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:52,110
money for me it's about the community

00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:55,800
Deverell a loser works is a new area

00:04:52,110 --> 00:05:01,889
it's very challenging but I think it's

00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:03,569
sort of a testament to how much the

00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:08,490
company cares

00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:10,770
I run meetups all over the world I help

00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:13,169
people get started and help those me has

00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,580
become self-sustaining there's a few

00:05:13,169 --> 00:05:17,430
that I've worked on earlier in the year

00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,050
I'm gonna be working on six more and the

00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:23,490
second half of the year if anybody in

00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:24,599
here is once like have a meet-up in

00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:29,220
their city I don't care where you are

00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:31,349
just let me know I also am a contributor

00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:35,250
new contributor to solar also super set

00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:39,690
which you'll see here do a lot of

00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:41,070
different things for both of them some

00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:43,680
of them are long-term projects some of

00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:47,070
them are short and I've contributed to a

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,199
lot of other projects in my life I'm

00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:51,870
also a long time open source hacker in

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,940
my hood so like trying to like steal my

00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:59,490
parents Internet and give it to the

00:05:53,940 --> 00:06:01,860
other people and also trying to do other

00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:05,699
nefarious things from along you know

00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:07,500
young age just curious but I'm based in

00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,780
San Francisco that was in Detroit and

00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,349
I'm willing like I said to help you kick

00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:14,159
off a meet-up

00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:18,090
now what I built which I'll show you in

00:06:14,159 --> 00:06:21,770
just a second is transfer learning

00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:26,150
powered navigation it's fast it so I

00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:28,169
view search as the the future of

00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:31,289
navigating an application you're not

00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:34,710
going to there's not going to be a menu

00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:37,020
box or like a hamburger in the corner

00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:38,669
you click you're just going to tell the

00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:42,090
application where you want to go what

00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:43,710
information you need and that's why I

00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:48,220
got into search and and I think you'll

00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:50,170
see some of that just a moment I use

00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:53,200
sentiment analysis tool that was trained

00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:55,240
on unstructured data it was classified

00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:58,450
by definition I'll talk about what that

00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,370
means or about what that is here it's in

00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:02,440
the same language and it's a similar

00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:06,190
domain so there was some topical overlap

00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:08,530
so we there's we have a data science

00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:13,150
team and they spend a long time working

00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:18,670
on e-commerce review data and that's a

00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:20,710
good data set because well you know you

00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:24,240
know the quality you can assess the

00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:26,590
reliability of a review if it's verified

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,090
like someone actually purchased the item

00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:29,230
they're reviewing there's still fake

00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:31,270
reviews out there that are verified

00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:33,280
purchases I found online but more or

00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:36,490
less the verified purchaser bought the

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,790
product and wrote a review candidly also

00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:44,290
they're classified with with some degree

00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:47,650
of I mean it's it was some degree of

00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:50,080
certainty so one and two you can assume

00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:54,970
those are going to be negative reviews

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:57,370
one or two stars and form five stars you

00:07:54,970 --> 00:08:00,130
can assume they're going to be good

00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:04,660
reviews or good sentiments and so I

00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:07,150
think that that that was a good a good

00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:09,070
project for them and it turned out it

00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,690
worked out for me I didn't I couldn't

00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:13,510
predict it there was some topical

00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:17,410
overlap and I noticed when I was

00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:20,380
reviewing my data that a lot of the

00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:24,760
stocks and liked a lot of the different

00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:26,650
things that I purchased were on Amazon

00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,270
they're sold on Amazon so I don't know

00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:31,630
if that has anything to do with anything

00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:34,450
but it's hard to dig in and one day I'll

00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:38,140
know is we're doing more testing in my

00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:44,770
time that I can and so let's let me show

00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:46,960
you the app really quickly that's that's

00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:50,050
a look at the app I'm actually going to

00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:56,830
bring the app over and drive for you on

00:08:50,050 --> 00:09:00,730
the screen but the way it works is it

00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:01,519
will give you facets that will predict

00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:05,240
the

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:08,869
the sentiment of analysts articles but I

00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:13,360
want you to take a look at this list

00:09:08,869 --> 00:09:19,309
right here in particular in particular

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:23,600
the second the second article on the

00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:31,639
left from analyst reviews does anyone

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:34,009
have an idea what the sentiment is well

00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:35,509
I'm lazy and sometimes when I'm going

00:09:34,009 --> 00:09:37,129
through all these articles I've been

00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:39,410
starting it up and loading it every day

00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:41,779
more or less a lot of days checking to

00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:44,990
see you know what's good and what's bad

00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:47,689
and even today I looked at this why

00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:50,839
beyond meat stock pop 10% and

00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:53,149
immediately thought by cuz I oh it's

00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:54,470
doing really well still well I've heard

00:09:53,149 --> 00:09:58,339
it's doing really well because I've been

00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:00,499
reading and if you look at the the text

00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:02,329
below the body Texas like Wall Street

00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:04,040
Journal is bullish on beyond meat but

00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:08,240
it's got nothing to do with fundamentals

00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:09,410
so typically that's a that is a bad sign

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,860
that there's something there's some

00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:15,459
underlying issue so let me show you the

00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,459
app in action

00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:43,320
oh it's hard to work this and then so

00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:49,610
see I had a lot of tabs but I'm Lily I'm

00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:52,320
going to use these tabs this is this is

00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:54,529
positive sentiment articles positive

00:10:52,320 --> 00:11:00,089
positive sentiment classified articles

00:10:54,529 --> 00:11:02,820
from our model so here walked out now

00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:06,779
look but again really quickly let's see

00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:11,209
here everyone here that has a computer

00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:11,209
will be able to do this in just a moment

00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:19,110
and it'll give you all your credentials

00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:22,050
and everything in your own instance I'll

00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:26,940
save it because I don't have I've never

00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:30,660
worked on this so here you can see it's

00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:33,240
a very simple app it's not too fancy it

00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:36,420
was built we have like a you are a UI

00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,240
framework that we used for building

00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:41,310
search apps called twit kit and it has a

00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,730
lot of features for fat for quickly

00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:46,410
building you eyes and that I just use it

00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,810
to build bare bones you guys like I I

00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:51,510
don't even want any if I could just have

00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:53,160
a search box and all the content surface

00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,300
later that'd be better like I want the

00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,860
first result to be the one I've been

00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,920
looking for I don't want to go through

00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:04,890
it so here you can kind of see how the

00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:08,490
facets are applied if you apply you can

00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:11,550
close that but just scrolling through

00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:24,110
this I mean it's pretty peculiar let's

00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:27,810
see if I do Lulu women so Lululemon oh

00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:29,279
wow earlier today they were more

00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,110
positive than they're negative now

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:34,470
they're negative more negative but just

00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:37,269
barely so you have to kind of take all

00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:39,819
of these results the grain of salt and

00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:42,910
and read through the articles when you

00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:47,379
can I don't know what they mean but

00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:50,350
Apple overwhelmingly positive see if

00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:55,559
there's another one no they're not even

00:12:50,350 --> 00:13:02,410
in here anymore that's good so this is a

00:12:55,559 --> 00:13:04,689
this app is only crawling the newer

00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,279
articles I don't know if like the other

00:13:04,689 --> 00:13:09,179
articles aren't in the same place but

00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:13,749
they just don't end up in the index

00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:16,420
typically and then so that's the app

00:13:13,749 --> 00:13:18,819
it's it's pretty straightforward

00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:22,199
the important thing is like all I'm

00:13:18,819 --> 00:13:29,139
doing is I mean I'm searching and and

00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:32,410
faceting on the tensorflow valley

00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:44,499
tensorflow generated values so I'll talk

00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:45,939
more about that so all the time I mean

00:13:44,499 --> 00:13:48,189
the biggest thing for me is like I read

00:13:45,939 --> 00:13:49,720
these articles myself and I get I get

00:13:48,189 --> 00:13:51,309
them wrong all the time like I don't

00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,420
know what it's saying and sentiment

00:13:51,309 --> 00:13:54,699
analysis that's better

00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:57,009
just like sentiment analysis has proven

00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:59,139
to be more like I mean convolutional

00:13:57,009 --> 00:14:01,449
neural networks have been have proven to

00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:03,819
be effective at MRI reading more

00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:06,850
effective at x-ray reading than than

00:14:03,819 --> 00:14:09,040
radiologists or like among the most

00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:15,790
trained most highly trained doctors and

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:18,730
I think there's hope that computers will

00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:20,559
be better drivers soon and then humans

00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:24,069
are slow they take breaks they need food

00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:27,069
they're otherwise hangry this is why I

00:14:24,069 --> 00:14:28,929
built it and so the other reasons or its

00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:30,670
difficult to view scalloped predictions

00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:32,019
at scale and we need a fast

00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:36,579
visualization that was lighter and

00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:39,850
cheaper than table low so you will get

00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:41,259
to use that in just a moment does

00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:44,019
anybody here familiar with the patchy

00:14:41,259 --> 00:14:45,620
superset has anybody used to ever seen

00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:48,690
it

00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:51,980
anybody here but you are anybody here

00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:57,120
familiar with Apache Solr I'm killing a

00:14:51,980 --> 00:15:00,210
search conference but yeah tableau is

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,950
too expensive for me if and so if you

00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:04,350
can add machine learning to an index

00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:09,150
pipeline I think you need to have some

00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:12,560
ability to see what's going on and then

00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:14,910
here will justify a good time to invest

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,770
sign up for fusion instance in Google

00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:19,260
Cloud just for simplicity and dealing

00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:21,060
with solar spin up a super set service

00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,670
on the same server it's going to start

00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,620
on its own you don't have to do anything

00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:28,200
and create a dashboard of the data

00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:30,570
matching certain sequel queries against

00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:33,510
your collection so you can see what this

00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:38,100
what the smart index recommends so all

00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:40,500
the there is a spark shell you can play

00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:43,710
with in the in the instance so if you

00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:46,800
want to SSH into your instance and play

00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:48,360
on the spark shell with like one example

00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,470
you're welcome to do that as well like

00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,450
something that has nothing to do a

00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:56,280
financial analyst so you can see how the

00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:59,310
sentiment and analysis model functions

00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:01,650
outside of there so if any if anybody

00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:05,490
wants to is anybody want to actually go

00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:07,440
to the lab I've heard that that

00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:10,140
something like people do this and then

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,690
maybe one or two people actually go to

00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:14,250
the lab but I can also just show you

00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:19,950
what you would have to do and it's

00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:26,370
pretty straightforward so if you want it

00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:27,990
to see this so at the end I'm going to

00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:30,720
show you I'm going to share what my big

00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:35,390
winners were so you can know so if you

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,390
go to loose it works labs

00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:55,640
it's not on here and you laughs

00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:57,740
dashboard so you can even have to go

00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:02,420
here when you have to create an account

00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:03,890
and it's not like a spam or like email

00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:07,429
marketing anything it's just we have to

00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:09,709
be able to tie an individual to a server

00:17:07,429 --> 00:17:13,189
because what if they do something bad

00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:17,390
with it and we don't we have no ability

00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:22,880
to you know stop them or prevent them

00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:25,309
from more havoc but occasionally I reach

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,280
out if to see if any developers have

00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:31,580
questions but that's it you would create

00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:33,920
an instance in this case it's what I

00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:39,580
call the financial Oracle's and so I'll

00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:42,410
show you how it works here I'm sorry oh

00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:43,960
it's not it's not on the screen thank

00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:50,530
you

00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:53,559
why is it I must have hit so you go

00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:55,940
sorry about that

00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:58,250
so you can see I want it to be full

00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:00,200
screen so you can see everything so yeah

00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:03,890
this is a temporary instance it only

00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:06,830
lasts for 24 hours I started this one a

00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:09,260
few minutes ago I guess an hour ago or

00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:12,559
less and it will tell you your

00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:14,570
credentials and you can access the solar

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:17,690
admin UI if you're more familiar with

00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:21,710
the solar admin UI gives you public IP

00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:24,350
and a direct link to the app that we've

00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:26,540
been discussing like the Search app so

00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:30,470
there are a few people going through it

00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:33,740
so I'll just wait briefly so if you just

00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:36,320
as a reminder you can go to loose it

00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:40,130
works comps last labs and then view the

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:43,360
the labs dashboard I'll go through that

00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:43,360
one more time so people can see it

00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:52,770
this works labs do labs dashboard

00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:55,140
instances so is Eric Hatcher in here

00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:58,230
so Eric co-founder loose' works he

00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:01,470
worked a lot on on this project a lot on

00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:03,630
the last project and advising me on this

00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:07,080
project as well so he can probably

00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:11,010
answer more questions but next day

00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:16,830
that's probably not true but it sounds

00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:18,809
good so yeah once you want once you

00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:23,190
create once you authenticate and you

00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:25,919
have a user these access attributes tell

00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:32,279
you everywhere that you need to go the

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:35,220
for for the search app to access tensor

00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:37,970
to access super set you need to take the

00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:43,440
public IP which is right here and their

00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:46,169
public IP and it's running I wrote a

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:54,090
start script just spin up a docker

00:19:46,169 --> 00:20:03,090
container and the password for everyone

00:19:54,090 --> 00:20:05,490
is admin super set and it you can load

00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:07,110
it with with test data but I didn't load

00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:12,890
it with any test data because I wanted

00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:17,690
people to see how to connect to it and

00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:17,690
see how they can use it for visualizing

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:31,220
visualizing search AI so once you once

00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:39,510
you have your lab once you have your lab

00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:40,799
start it you can click on the demo URL

00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:43,200
if you click the direct link it'll take

00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:47,100
you off of this page which is bad so I

00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:49,770
think you want to click the first link

00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:52,429
and it'll take you to a login and I

00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:56,160
called it short search just because I

00:20:52,429 --> 00:20:58,650
think it was most helpful for me

00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:03,450
understanding what I should not invest

00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:09,120
in or invest in options put options that

00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:10,860
expect the stock to fail which are risky

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,780
and I'm not giving anybody financial

00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:14,309
advice to be clear I'm just this is just

00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:26,400
I tried it with this I don't know

00:21:14,309 --> 00:21:29,190
anything about finance so and then you

00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:35,909
also get a diffusion admin the diffusion

00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:39,900
admin is the fusion admin is an

00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:42,600
interface for for solar mostly for this

00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:46,559
exercise but it's also the way we were

00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:49,140
able to add tensor flow really easily to

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:52,289
our to search pipeline to an index

00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:55,289
pipeline specifically so typically if

00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:59,490
you see anything typically if you wanted

00:21:55,289 --> 00:22:01,860
to add tensor flow to whether your

00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:06,059
indexes index pipelines or query

00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:08,549
pipelines you would need to train the

00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:11,010
model and the traditional tool set tool

00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:12,659
chain that you use like we used to put

00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:14,490
our notebooks but that's just because

00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:20,090
that's what we use in school you can

00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:23,330
also just use the command line and then

00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:27,630
protocol buffer is what you should use

00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:30,390
to serve your serve your model up

00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:33,090
because that's a pretty universal of

00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:34,770
indirect Gnostic data interchange format

00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:37,919
so if you if you're not familiar with

00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:41,549
protocol buffers or how to how to use

00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:44,610
them for serving your models you can

00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:47,510
google it or send me an e-mail I'll

00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:52,710
point you in the right direction and

00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:56,820
then we're actually serving serving the

00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:59,570
model with SPARC but we'll get into that

00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,570
in just a minute

00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:09,380
so once you log in let's see if you just

00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:14,730
click on the password it'll copy also

00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:16,289
once you log in you can I just thought

00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:22,409
you saw the app but you should log into

00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:24,360
diffusion you can see you'll see a

00:23:22,409 --> 00:23:29,669
welcome Quick Start Guide that's not

00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:36,899
really that useful for this talk you can

00:23:29,669 --> 00:23:41,360
see in the query workbench the fields

00:23:36,899 --> 00:23:47,279
that are present and in the crawling of

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:51,659
the Yahoo News app so these fields are I

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:55,980
mean these are all and the web page I

00:23:51,659 --> 00:24:03,590
didn't define them and we map each field

00:23:55,980 --> 00:24:08,309
to solar field so token and string and

00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:10,309
then here this field was was added by me

00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:14,039
the sentiment field and I'll show you

00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:16,789
how I added that so you can see it's not

00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:16,789
too complicated

00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:25,620
so

00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:50,720
so I'm not gonna wait for the fuel to

00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:54,120
simulate results still show up yeah I

00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:56,340
essentially I loaded my model which I

00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,970
store in a zip so you have to if you're

00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:04,770
serving up tensorflow models and spark

00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:07,170
you have to bundle them right and so

00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:10,080
here's the zip the bundled zip of the

00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:16,020
tensorflow model and the input field in

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:19,470
my case is input field but that's it's

00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:24,390
really important that the actual field

00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:27,810
is the body of the article as uh I think

00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:33,510
there's a body right here and so it's

00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:36,480
best to copy an existing solar field to

00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:41,040
another field if you're going to be

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:49,880
using it for learning just to isolate

00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:56,820
like say you update a solar field but

00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:58,260
you know you uh you update a model there

00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:02,730
either way if you update a solar field

00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:06,810
or model you want them to be loosely

00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:09,930
coupled from each other just as a best

00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:11,670
principle and in this case we're copying

00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:13,650
if you do any manipulation to the body

00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:16,380
like in your UI you don't want to do

00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:19,740
that manipulation to what the models

00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:22,560
being fed right so that's another reason

00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:24,990
why and the part of the loose coupling

00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:28,500
so this is just pure text we haven't

00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:31,940
done any manipulation to it and then

00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:35,390
we're predicting the sentiment and then

00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:35,390
let's see here

00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:42,680
I've already indexed the data for anyone

00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:47,420
who's going through the lab so you can

00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:51,950
sort of quickly get up and running now I

00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:54,890
can show you how to connect to super set

00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:59,330
connect your solar collection to super

00:26:54,890 --> 00:27:02,570
Senate I encountered a lot of pain with

00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:04,190
this but it's gotten better and I've

00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:09,290
made a small contribution to make it

00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:16,370
easier to and I'm going to expand on

00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:19,220
that if it needs expanding upon but if

00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:23,660
you go to sew on superset it's a pretty

00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:28,640
simple user interface that's one of the

00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:34,100
things I like about it and you just have

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:41,870
to add a database so I had a database

00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:44,480
here the name of your database is the

00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:47,570
name of your collection so I'm an active

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:50,390
step to actually doing this I think the

00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:52,870
principles are just I mean they're the

00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:55,220
most important you just need to specify

00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:57,920
the name of the collection that you want

00:27:55,220 --> 00:28:01,210
to expose and super set so in this case

00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:05,930
it's Financial Oracle's and then there's

00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:09,890
you have to use a sequel alchemy URI so

00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:11,960
Solar sequel is super powerful fusion

00:28:09,890 --> 00:28:14,180
sequel makes it easier to connect super

00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,160
set but you can do this with solar

00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:26,230
sequel if you have any questions you can

00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:26,230
reach out and these other these other

00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:33,950
fields aren't really needed to get up

00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:36,260
and running immediately I mean expose

00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:38,180
this DB in the sequel lab is probably

00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:39,890
going to be interesting because you

00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:42,460
could do some more explorations whether

00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:42,460
I use in the UI

00:28:47,539 --> 00:28:54,750
so let's see here to determine so in

00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:56,100
this sequel alchemy URI this is tricky

00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:59,159
it's not going to be the same for

00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:01,590
everyone but if you are trying to

00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:03,539
connect in a cloud environment you're

00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:08,370
going to need to specify your internal

00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:10,159
IP it because the external IP is on the

00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:14,330
other side of a load balancer and the

00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:18,750
Syst your systems have no idea about it

00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:23,090
the ephemeral IP so let's see if I so to

00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:27,059
find the new I to find the internal IP

00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:32,000
the best thing I could come up with for

00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:32,000
in time for this talk which is uh which

00:29:32,629 --> 00:29:41,149
was to just specify pipe true the first

00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:44,190
pipe true result and the counsel log is

00:29:41,149 --> 00:29:46,789
where your internal IP is so by the way

00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:50,250
in in labs you can always see

00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:52,679
console.log just in case you want to

00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:57,059
follow along and understand what's going

00:29:52,679 --> 00:30:00,929
on so this is what this is also one of

00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:03,360
my my favorite features of this app the

00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:05,460
labs app is like you can actually see

00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,710
what's going on and follow along if you

00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:10,019
want to create recreate some of this in

00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:22,139
your own environment and when you're

00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:25,500
trying to do so hive colon sequel

00:30:22,139 --> 00:30:27,720
alchemy URI string is pretty basic it's

00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,519
the standard format and the password

00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:32,360
which I got to go back and look at and

00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:32,360
then

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:45,190
that's a good example so this what this

00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:52,450
means is so there's there's two methods

00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:56,259
for communicating and with hive and we

00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:58,899
use transport I mean we use binary and

00:30:56,259 --> 00:31:01,210
there's a few ways for authenticating

00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:04,210
but I mean we could go down a rabbit

00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:07,840
hole on authentication you can if you

00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:11,440
need LDAP or or something else more

00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:13,359
Enterprise friendly you all of the

00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:15,179
authentication options are available to

00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:26,169
you this is just about connecting to

00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:28,350
Siebel so then jump right into adding

00:31:26,169 --> 00:31:28,350
this

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,990
and the password is

00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:54,580
well so this won't go long but if you

00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:59,080
leave you'll miss out on what's the big

00:31:54,580 --> 00:32:03,670
with the big winners are so ya know

00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:05,200
perfect so I tried to connect to it

00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:06,400
never works the first time for me for

00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:12,730
some reason this time it worked the

00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:16,150
first time so the format is just hive

00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:18,430
admin hive : its last less and you can

00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:19,450
see it above its a straightforward but

00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:20,860
the important thing to remember is

00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:27,430
internal IP if you're using our

00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:31,890
environment and then you save that again

00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:31,890
it's pretty simple and intuitive and

00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:41,470
here to add to add tables so table here

00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:44,590
is the financial Oracle's the schemas

00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:48,880
default so if you don't specify schema

00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:52,600
and solar sequel its default always and

00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:59,800
then the table name I'll make the same

00:32:52,600 --> 00:33:03,280
just to prevent any accidents so then we

00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:06,130
get to creating a chart it's it's again

00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:08,290
really simple and I think that you'll

00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:09,970
find some use for this and we'll hop in

00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:13,270
the spark shell as well so you can see

00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:16,330
how I varies in terms of usability and

00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:19,180
ease and like really getting your

00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:21,340
company to invest and machine learning

00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:23,140
there's like a lot of companies they

00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:24,880
have maybe somebody's working on

00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:26,500
something it's not in production or

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,780
there's not a lot of investment in it or

00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:31,260
there's not a whole lot of confidence I

00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:35,380
think the important thing about

00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:36,640
something like this is it makes what

00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:39,340
machine learning is doing for your

00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:41,440
business really accessible and even

00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:44,050
auditable so you can evaluate it you can

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,330
share these dashboards email because

00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:48,430
people aren't going to dive in and try

00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:51,010
to understand all the things that are

00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:56,160
going on and happening behind the scenes

00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:56,160
I think the dashboards give them a quick

00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:01,760
entry into entry point into what's going

00:33:59,530 --> 00:34:04,820
on so if we create a new chart

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:07,760
here this is all coming from solar and

00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:12,139
from fusion and I guess the simplest

00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:23,179
chart would be like you know is this a

00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:25,190
good time to invest and so I mean

00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:28,940
looking at my graph from earlier

00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:31,399
probably thinking yes now there's no

00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:36,830
we're not using any of the dates there

00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:38,929
there are date/time fields in that index

00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:42,080
that we have from the crawl Yahoo News

00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:45,200
data but we're not using it because it's

00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:47,120
not the article which is a shame it's

00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:52,669
like when we fetched it and when it was

00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:55,399
last modified which is like 50 years ago

00:34:52,669 --> 00:34:58,630
so not really was last modified it and

00:34:55,399 --> 00:35:01,750
then let's see here so the count is just

00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:05,630
exactly what it sounds like and then

00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:06,920
group by is when we get into picking the

00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:10,840
prediction but I don't know if you saw

00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:14,960
you can see all these fields to

00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:16,930
understand which one and it's to

00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:19,090
understand which ones are available and

00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:23,060
here's how simple it is

00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:25,250
BAM so overwhelmingly and it's changing

00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:27,940
throughout the day so earlier this

00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:32,030
morning I would say it was even more

00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:35,600
overwhelmingly positive then the numbers

00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:38,920
were lower but so you can see that's how

00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:47,060
simple it was just to show you know

00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:48,470
market sentiment in general and this is

00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:51,890
what the analyst thing about the market

00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:56,660
I don't know like how how much analysts

00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:58,460
eye information maps to like the the

00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:01,610
actual stock market but they all claim

00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:05,630
that they have led to all of these these

00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:08,570
successes so maybe that is a good place

00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:11,300
to start and then to save it and add it

00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:14,040
to a new dashboard you just save here

00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:24,290
and add to a new dashboard and

00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:26,760
like visualizing search predictions so

00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:28,350
and it'll take you to the dashboard and

00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,990
it's simple but you could stay there and

00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:33,900
keep working and this is really easy you

00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:37,410
can export the chart metadata force

00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:40,890
freeze refresh the sequel lab lots of

00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:46,020
usefulness and evaluating your index and

00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:49,080
your queries or other information about

00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:52,530
your search application if you store it

00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:54,420
in a collection so now we can go deeper

00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:58,290
and and and create a lot more

00:36:54,420 --> 00:37:00,720
visualizations and I think I will but I

00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:04,050
want to ensure that if there are any

00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:13,160
questions about what's going on here so

00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:13,160
far or like any curiosities or good

00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:34,780
so that's a good question and I believe

00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:40,480
that that's being discussed now just

00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:44,650
joins in general and I have not I have

00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:46,390
not attempted to to query to collections

00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:51,190
I think the the issue might be the

00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:54,250
connector between the I between sequel

00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:57,670
and and supercell I think it should be

00:37:54,250 --> 00:38:00,310
possible there's no limitation other

00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:03,010
than the connector so let me check

00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:06,510
actually I'll create another so I can

00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:06,510
create another collection really quickly

00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:20,400
and we can find out it'll take like

00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:20,400
maybe less than a minute

00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:42,789
I should take less than that Internet

00:38:44,769 --> 00:39:03,740
and then I go to these horses index

00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:11,569
workbench data sources no existing data

00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:13,510
source so I can point to cnn.com so it's

00:39:11,569 --> 00:39:16,670
a it's really interesting thought

00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:18,380
because if you're trying to do like

00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:20,440
investment analysis you probably want to

00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:25,269
pull in data from more than one source

00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:25,269
multiple collections in this case so

00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:34,000
we'll limit the documents to five

00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:48,100
and so here we have five documents now

00:39:44,810 --> 00:39:52,360
I'm going to try I wanted to try to

00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:52,360
query both collections and join them

00:39:54,790 --> 00:40:10,090
very very good question

00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:10,090
I've never tried to oh let's see tables

00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:32,380
you know what I forgot the each

00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:35,170
collection is treated as a database so

00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:46,750
even though they're they sort of felt

00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:52,450
more like a table let's see how this is

00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:59,620
going to be interesting it may work I'm

00:40:52,450 --> 00:41:02,710
not sure if it will but I don't see

00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:11,220
where my connection string is although I

00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:16,240
went to edit table it's a database edit

00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:31,670
so I'll grab that and then create a new

00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:35,690
database collection too

00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:35,690
grab this password again

00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,690
seems okay

00:41:55,849 --> 00:42:02,999
now let's see if we can Oh

00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:06,269
so if I let me make sure I exposed it

00:42:02,999 --> 00:42:22,219
and I supposed to see DB in the sequel

00:42:06,269 --> 00:42:22,219
lab suppose this DB in the sequel lab I

00:42:23,569 --> 00:42:34,200
need to add a table just to be sure that

00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:36,029
as a table collection to default again

00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:48,299
like I said just to keep things simple

00:42:36,029 --> 00:42:51,289
I'll name it collection to again did I

00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:51,289
pick the wrong

00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:01,480
just let me check maybe this is blocking

00:42:59,349 --> 00:43:05,680
me before I can try it but I don't think

00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:09,820
that's collection - oh you know what I

00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:13,420
know what it is so I set up collection -

00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:15,730
and I saw this these simulated results

00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:18,280
but I hadn't actually indexed any data I

00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:20,140
hadn't started to crawl so that's that's

00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:23,530
what happens if there's no data in there

00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:29,340
so I started to crawl there's now data

00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:29,340
in there see what happens

00:43:42,809 --> 00:43:54,299
come on it doesn't know that it exists

00:43:45,269 --> 00:44:15,239
yet I even though it's there let's see

00:43:54,299 --> 00:44:18,749
here so it's definitely there so let me

00:44:15,239 --> 00:44:23,009
see I'm gonna pull up the solar you are

00:44:18,749 --> 00:44:29,779
just to make sure everything I'm seeing

00:44:23,009 --> 00:44:36,229
I can believe sometimes there's some lag

00:44:29,779 --> 00:44:36,229
uh-oh 6535

00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:43,020
hmm

00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:59,259
I always forget there's a too many

00:44:53,949 --> 00:45:04,979
there's too many URLs in my head and I'm

00:44:59,259 --> 00:45:08,709
almost not a better clock's ticking so

00:45:04,979 --> 00:45:12,579
you know collection 2 is here and

00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:21,420
financial Oracle's is here so should be

00:45:12,579 --> 00:45:24,779
a table so let's see if I can default

00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:24,779
collection 2

00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:35,130
I don't know looks like it doesn't like

00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:38,790
trying to connect to multiple databases

00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:46,060
if they're in the same the same source

00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:48,730
which would make sense because well if

00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:50,950
they share a schema schema name I don't

00:45:48,730 --> 00:45:53,170
know I have to dig in I'm gonna dig into

00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:55,839
it there could be something else going

00:45:53,170 --> 00:46:00,250
on mate like there's a few different

00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:02,440
ways you can connect to super set or

00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:05,680
Zeppelin using solar so I just have to

00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:07,839
look into how I'm connecting if that's a

00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:11,410
limitation that I've imposed by my own

00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:17,530
choice of how to connect I'm using PI

00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:22,440
hive but maybe there's a better way so

00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:26,680
let's see here is there so I'm almost

00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:41,410
against is there a do you have it

00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:45,310
charge the adapter oh I have it it's

00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:48,210
here but I think the presentation is

00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:48,210
taking a lot of power

00:46:53,400 --> 00:47:01,500
or if you have a European charger but

00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:13,480
the a good thing about so I need to look

00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:19,050
into that limitation because that's a

00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:19,050
major one actually Thanks

00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:28,690
perfect the big thing the great thing

00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:30,370
about superset is it's super lightweight

00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:35,920
and you can get started with it really

00:47:30,370 --> 00:47:40,540
quickly let me see if I can add as a

00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:43,350
table I'll try this I don't know what's

00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:43,350
gonna if it's gonna work

00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:53,900
yes so I think I bet it's the way I'm

00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:55,550
connecting but the the thing that's

00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:58,940
really good about superset is just that

00:47:55,550 --> 00:48:01,430
it's a very lightweight and it's really

00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:04,220
easy to use so in the companies that you

00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:06,920
superset it's very popular like it has a

00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:09,050
lot of adoption because it's not overly

00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:12,440
complex like I think Zeppelin is great

00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:16,609
for data scientists and engineers and

00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:18,230
super set is really accessible I don't

00:48:16,609 --> 00:48:21,800
know I mean I don't know if it has

00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:23,780
enough features for all data scientists

00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:26,839
but definitely some that it has the

00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:29,950
sequel lab so has some interesting

00:48:26,839 --> 00:48:36,500
type-ahead features and and query search

00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:43,460
features that help you so look start

00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:46,160
from like the I think that's really good

00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:49,069
and you can share query copy to

00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:52,609
clipboard this query history

00:48:49,069 --> 00:48:54,890
lots of shortcuts throughout and it's

00:48:52,609 --> 00:48:55,369
probably in your language is it in

00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:58,490
German

00:48:55,369 --> 00:49:02,300
I don't know people's language here is

00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:04,550
German but it is in German any of any

00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:09,230
other questions about it I can show you

00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:11,839
some another visualization as well an

00:49:09,230 --> 00:49:15,800
easy one or a heart a more complex one

00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:18,170
if you want any any questions did you

00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:20,960
did did you try to set up this in the

00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:23,960
lab disease lab application did you have

00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:26,210
any trouble it's really simple right so

00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:28,400
I think you could probably take it but

00:49:26,210 --> 00:49:31,040
further than than this I think that's

00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:34,270
the goal and like if you encounter any

00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:40,040
problems or you fix an issue with sequel

00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:41,839
solar sequel open a JIRA issue and email

00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:44,990
the mailing list and make a pull request

00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:47,710
or on superset if you encounter

00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:50,839
something I think you just open an issue

00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:54,280
and they'll get on it as soon as they

00:49:50,839 --> 00:50:02,359
can't the various people the community

00:49:54,280 --> 00:50:05,089
and I think that's pretty much all I

00:50:02,359 --> 00:50:09,500
want to share like I I think that this

00:50:05,089 --> 00:50:17,230
is a very pro practical use of this

00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:17,230
application but it's not the only use I

00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:26,030
talked through these because I didn't

00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:29,109
want to go through them but this is they

00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:33,319
sent my slides I hate slides by the way

00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:35,020
and these are so I just want to show you

00:50:33,319 --> 00:50:41,270
because you stayed for the whole

00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:43,940
demonstration which ones I picked

00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:47,960
because of the financial Oracle's app

00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:49,849
and that was how I made money I mean I

00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:52,430
wasn't trying to make any money I used

00:50:49,849 --> 00:50:57,440
the Robin Hood for it's like a mobile

00:50:52,430 --> 00:51:00,290
app but I'm not big I had like $2,000 in

00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:04,119
there before I tried this and it worked

00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:06,560
out so but there's a lot of

00:51:04,119 --> 00:51:09,920
opportunities to work on all of these

00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:12,770
projects definitely at loose it works

00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,930
but I think at a lot of places because

00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:18,109
open source is starting to see a lot of

00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:19,160
support commercially from companies

00:51:18,109 --> 00:51:21,250
they're making investments and it's

00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:24,020
really good because I could not afford

00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:29,780
Windows so I had to use Ubuntu and

00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:33,079
that's how I got into it and it's just a

00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:36,230
thank you and oh yeah there's a happy

00:51:33,079 --> 00:51:38,599
hour salt and bone and I think Eric will

00:51:36,230 --> 00:51:40,730
sign the leucine and action book he'll

00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:44,599
sign autographs for anybody who's seen

00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:46,640
in action and all these are all people

00:51:44,599 --> 00:51:49,160
on the team that helped me there's

00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:51,589
Richard he's over there and Grandma

00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:52,760
Julian and so he had the happy hours I

00:51:51,589 --> 00:51:55,940
saw him bone I think we're probably

00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:57,680
going to just be talking about search

00:51:55,940 --> 00:52:02,630
stuff and like building search

00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:05,590
applications and trying to make solar

00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:12,620
less hairy so

00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:15,140
Harry felicitous Harry from me if you

00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:19,310
have any questions you can email me or

00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:21,410
DM me on Twitter I'm happy to help

00:52:19,310 --> 00:52:24,170
that's pretty much all I do is try to

00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:27,970
help developers so and this is what I do

00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:30,050
in my my free time has tried to extend

00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:37,990
some of the tools that we work with

00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:37,990
