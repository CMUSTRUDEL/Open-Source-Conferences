Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2019: Gregorio Kusowski â€“ 50 Shades of Legacy #bbuzz
Publication date: 2019-06-28
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2019 #bbuzz
Description: 
	What defines a Legacy System and why is it considered Legacy? Perhaps you are writing one right now, it's just a matter of time to figure it out.

Do buzzwords also become Legacy? In this talk we are going to review one historical buzzword Episode, see how trends repeat over and over, and what can be done to avoid pitfalls. Our behaviour is also related to it, so how are we doing on overall when compared to other areas?

This talk is presented by heycar.

so thank you very much it's a pleasure

00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,730
to be here as we know we are going to

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,610
talk

00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,619
two shades of Legacy the original idea

00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:22,410
for the name of this talk was actually

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,630
something more that's a negative it was

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:28,020
like death by buzz words 50 shades of

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:34,079
legacy but let's try to keep everything

00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:36,329
more positive so this is the agenda that

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,300
we are going to present today so

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:43,200
basically a quick introduction about a

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,719
car the company I'm working at hey car

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,710
is a used car market place we are here

00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:52,500
from Berlin we are joining the market to

00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:57,990
bring like different solutions so we are

00:00:52,500 --> 00:01:00,870
not help sorry we are not happy by just

00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:03,239
helping the customer to connect to the

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,210
dealer but we want to go further and we

00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:08,700
want actually to achieve success from a

00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:10,439
customer perspective so we actually want

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:14,070
to achieve transactions between the

00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:15,990
customers and the dealers but since in

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,850
the context of Berlin buzzwords we have

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:20,399
this like okay I'm wearing this hat or

00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,530
that other hat today I'm not wearing the

00:01:20,399 --> 00:01:26,240
hey car hat I'm wearing more like the

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:29,490
community hat so I'm from November go

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:33,270
the name may sound familiar it's like my

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:37,350
Hamburg or New Hamburg it's a small city

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:40,920
from Brazil I'm living here in Berlin

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:43,049
already for two and a half years some of

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,539
my hobbies so just you know a bit about

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,340
myself I'm into cycling mechanical

00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:49,560
keyboards software engineering

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,539
distributed programming so my free time

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,219
is basically mixing around those topics

00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:58,170
next topic then we are going to talk

00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:01,679
about the definitions so we are going to

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:05,569
cover buzzwords and also what legacy

00:02:01,679 --> 00:02:10,039
systems are so when we talk about legacy

00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:12,959
usually what comes to our heads like

00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:15,870
considering the software engineering

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,780
background is usually linked to

00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:21,390
something bad but if we think on a more

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,060
general way we are going to think like

00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:27,150
okay what I'm leaving for the future

00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:31,110
like are we being good at ancestors

00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:34,110
so if we talk only about legacy systems

00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,120
usually and this term is not a very

00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,310
accurate because legacy is a bit

00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,310
arbitrary to know if a system is a

00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:43,200
legacy or not maybe if we ask like the

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:45,209
maintainer of Lucine they are going to

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,159
say okay I'm working on a legacy system

00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:50,310
maybe they are going to say no it's not

00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:53,900
legacy but usually it's a system that is

00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:56,430
out of date it's not using the latest

00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:59,180
architecture the latest languages the

00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:01,950
latest frameworks and libraries and

00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,840
usually and I mean usually because

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:06,450
sometimes it's legacy and it also

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:09,420
doesn't work so it's the time that we

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:12,390
need to touch the legacy but let's

00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,909
consider it usually works some examples

00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:18,150
about this my previous bank in Brazil

00:03:14,909 --> 00:03:21,510
they are still running on COBOL maybe

00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:23,280
some banks here in Germany as well at

00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:28,980
least my current bank I know it's using

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:32,430
a more JVM stack so I'm quite happy with

00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:34,380
that but also we have some cron tasks

00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:36,389
they are keeping our systems running

00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,690
sometimes we don't even know they exist

00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:41,970
but someone wrote them and put it there

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:46,440
they are keeping the website or the

00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:48,389
system running I also I imagine a good

00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,160
part of us here have like a blog and

00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:53,250
probably we implemented this blog a few

00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:56,790
years ago it was using jQuery it's not

00:03:53,250 --> 00:04:00,000
like the buzzword of the moment anymore

00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:04,340
but today since it's not the buzzword

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,349
some people would say okay it's legacy

00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:10,889
now let's think about what we are doing

00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:13,199
right now so let's say I'm writing a new

00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:15,150
micro service I'm using Swift I don't

00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:18,090
use personally but I just try to pick

00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:23,340
one of the language that are coming to

00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:25,470
let's say back-end development so let's

00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:29,430
say I'm writing a new micro service in

00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:32,130
Swift using Kafka and it's like my best

00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:35,630
work so far I'm super happy and

00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:38,969
confident with that is that the legacy

00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:40,630
I'm not really sure a few weeks ago I

00:04:38,969 --> 00:04:43,120
had to fix one

00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:44,860
in production and actually I discovered

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,260
that the data was being generated wrong

00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:49,660
and I I don't have a clear idea on how

00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:51,970
to fix the generation of data I know how

00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:54,760
to fix the wrong data so I wrote the

00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:57,250
script every few days I go there I run

00:04:54,760 --> 00:05:02,020
the script I fix the data is that legacy

00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:04,690
like two weeks old and like my new micro

00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:08,170
front-end I think that that's the the

00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:12,790
latest term regarding architecture that

00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:15,730
we are talking about is it legacy let's

00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:18,310
take a look at this later so now let's

00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:21,610
think about birth words both words are

00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:23,980
usually words that are tied or they are

00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:25,900
fashionable and by fashionable we can

00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:29,680
also relate with trends that are also

00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:33,310
time related to one specific time or one

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:37,480
specific context so that's what we get

00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:41,230
from buzzwords getting the hype cycle

00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:45,010
from Gartner we know how the technology

00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:47,050
trends they usually work so we have like

00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:51,010
this over expectation on top of

00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:53,830
technologies and after some time we have

00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:56,410
like this pushback where we are not so

00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:59,890
happy not so confident and after the

00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:02,890
spirit comes destabilization so as they

00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:07,540
say it's a cycle and by cycle it means

00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:10,990
it can repeat also just one quick

00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:13,420
overview regarding hypes and key words I

00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:17,110
just got all of them from this blog post

00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:19,510
hype driven development so there are

00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:21,940
there is a set of keywords and a set of

00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:25,150
pipes that are coming and usually they

00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:27,400
follow the same trend also if you want

00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:31,450
to check more about this Gartner has

00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:33,700
this technology quadrant it's pretty

00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:36,520
interesting to see how what is coming

00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:40,000
what is hot what is not so hot regarding

00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:43,270
technology we don't have much time to

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,970
talk about history and this is actually

00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:49,000
what was going to give the name of death

00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:52,600
by buzzwords to the talk it's the AI

00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,249
winter I think for this conference it

00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:57,069
makes a lot of sense because

00:06:54,249 --> 00:07:00,309
we had two episodes basically the first

00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:02,889
AI winter it lasted for around six years

00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:06,159
in the second one as well basically

00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:10,509
there was this over expectation on top

00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:13,269
of artificial intelligence and with over

00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:15,729
expectation there is a time that we are

00:07:13,269 --> 00:07:18,819
going to have the disillusion of seeing

00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:22,089
okay we are not getting the value from

00:07:18,819 --> 00:07:27,339
that so we invested a lot of money there

00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:32,169
is no return now let's compare a bit

00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:36,849
regarding software engineering and other

00:07:32,169 --> 00:07:38,379
areas regarding legacy so if if I talk

00:07:36,849 --> 00:07:41,409
to someone that is not coming from the

00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:43,989
IT background and I try to talk about

00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:48,399
legacy probably art is something that is

00:07:43,989 --> 00:07:50,969
going to show up but when we talk about

00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:54,339
legacy we are not only talking about bad

00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:57,429
legacy so we have work on computer

00:07:54,339 --> 00:08:00,189
science from ad from Alan Turing on

00:07:57,429 --> 00:08:04,149
software engineering when it's not

00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:06,909
exactly linked together with languages

00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:09,879
and frameworks we have some work from

00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:10,929
Kent back with extreme programming work

00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:13,839
from Martin Fowler

00:08:10,929 --> 00:08:16,809
on architecture also methodologies so

00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:18,939
agile I consider as part of software

00:08:16,809 --> 00:08:21,579
engineering so it's a process and it's

00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:25,539
something that is a good legacy we still

00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:29,079
use today there's also one initiative

00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:32,829
from from Paul Graham from Y Combinator

00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:35,050
and he wants to design a language it's

00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:38,829
called art language and actually they

00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:41,289
run a hacker news on top of that for for

00:08:38,829 --> 00:08:44,019
a while the idea of the language is

00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:46,389
actually to be designed to last for a

00:08:44,019 --> 00:08:47,980
century so he wanted to design a

00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:51,269
language that is going to last for a

00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:55,120
century it's a pre interesting approach

00:08:51,269 --> 00:08:57,610
the language system not ready but the

00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,480
thing is like his giving time to it

00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:04,449
until he finds the best solution it's

00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,040
worth the the read I never used the

00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:08,090
language but it's super interesting

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:11,150
interesting

00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:15,820
now thinking when we go to language so

00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:15,820
art language is not trending yet

00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:22,010
probably you heard about CoffeeScript

00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:24,770
and Jeremy is the outer the creator of

00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:29,540
CoffeeScript then he posted this photo

00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:31,160
on Instagram and well this is the tweet

00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:34,550
where he's mentioning the the photon

00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:36,980
Instagram and he got this comment I

00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:41,210
don't know if you everyone can read it

00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:43,940
but basically someone is wishing him and

00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:47,630
his project owner hot days in hell

00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:50,030
because of the language like is this the

00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:52,730
legacy we want to build as software

00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:57,620
engineers as data scientist data

00:09:52,730 --> 00:10:01,100
engineers and basically we see this

00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:05,930
behavior of like people acting in a

00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:09,470
negative way now let's get back to our

00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:14,090
legacy systems or not so legacy our

00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:16,700
recent systems so my new micro service

00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:19,190
that I was super super proud of what

00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,140
happens when the requirements are being

00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:24,350
changed or new requirements are coming

00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:27,560
and what is going to happen if we are

00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:30,950
talking about this let's say two years

00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:33,260
from now probably I will look back at my

00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:36,560
code and I've see I will say like okay

00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:39,560
now it's legacy like I need to upgrade

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,350
the dependencies I need it's not the

00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:44,960
latest architecture or we don't use cafe

00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:46,910
anymore who knows

00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:52,070
well I don't need to mention the other

00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:54,470
ones but then I remember after a meet up

00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:56,930
I was talking to a CTO he was mentioning

00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:58,970
like oh we create micro services that

00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:02,210
are so small that instead of bugging

00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:04,490
fixing bugs we can just drop the micro

00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:07,760
service and write it again and I was

00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:10,490
like okay how how people are actually

00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:14,750
happy that they can write something that

00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:18,040
is going to last and we are reliving

00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:20,300
really this mary condom syndrome that

00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,379
withdraw things away we are not

00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,479
satisfied by them

00:11:21,379 --> 00:11:26,479
and then we just throw away and rewrite

00:11:23,479 --> 00:11:30,049
from scratch the impact it has to

00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:31,929
business is huge and now let's compare

00:11:30,049 --> 00:11:33,999
with other industries so let's say I

00:11:31,929 --> 00:11:36,859
have a flat tire

00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:38,959
should I go to the mechanic and or

00:11:36,859 --> 00:11:41,299
actually not to the mechanic to a new

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,979
store or since I'm from hey car should I

00:11:41,299 --> 00:11:46,189
buy a new car because I got a flat tire

00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:50,359
I don't think we are getting it wrong

00:11:46,189 --> 00:11:52,129
sorry we are getting it right and then

00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:54,229
there's a crack in the basement of my

00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:58,369
house should I buy a new house

00:11:54,229 --> 00:12:02,679
build a new house well we can go deep

00:11:58,369 --> 00:12:06,049
into like health care but then like just

00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:12,039
imagine like replacing everything or I

00:12:06,049 --> 00:12:14,779
don't know user creativity for this so

00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:19,099
what I can see from that we are just too

00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:20,569
young as an industry so basically how

00:12:19,099 --> 00:12:23,149
many years of software software

00:12:20,569 --> 00:12:26,859
engineering we have compared to for

00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:29,720
example civil engineering or healthcare

00:12:26,859 --> 00:12:31,909
now let's talk about post legacy

00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:34,039
basically the moment you are getting a

00:12:31,909 --> 00:12:37,249
legacy let's say you are receiving or

00:12:34,039 --> 00:12:40,970
taking over a legacy I have this case

00:12:37,249 --> 00:12:43,239
was a company in Brazil I worked at they

00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:46,789
selected one mobile application

00:12:43,239 --> 00:12:50,449
framework it was giving this cross

00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:53,179
compilation feature and it was using

00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:56,449
Java when one point to that means Java

00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:58,369
without generics Java without

00:12:56,449 --> 00:13:01,100
annotations as well

00:12:58,369 --> 00:13:03,529
proprietary firm framework also a very

00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:05,179
specific UI kit that you could not

00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:07,729
relate with anything available in the

00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:10,519
market they made the choice that people

00:13:07,729 --> 00:13:13,579
were looking at like oh what what is

00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:16,999
this but then comes like let's try to

00:13:13,579 --> 00:13:20,720
understand what was the context so the

00:13:16,999 --> 00:13:25,549
year was 2010 this was the market share

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:28,789
the top one was Symbian OS so the

00:13:25,549 --> 00:13:32,119
operating system from Nokia the second

00:13:28,789 --> 00:13:35,120
one was iOS and it was not performing so

00:13:32,119 --> 00:13:37,910
well Android was you

00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:41,750
like starting and Blackberry was

00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:46,010
ascending so what let's say you are a

00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:49,160
player in mobility what can you do to

00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:52,100
proceed with that and you need to take a

00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,890
decision and then if you join a company

00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:57,500
and you get just the first requirements

00:13:54,890 --> 00:14:00,380
like the first not requirements but the

00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,900
first picture of the system you look at

00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:04,880
this in what but then you start to

00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:07,100
understand the context and ok it makes

00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,160
sense I don't know what is going to to

00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:13,760
happen in this market also iOS was kind

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:16,310
of ok but in Brazil it's it's not

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,230
affordable for one enterprise as one

00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:21,770
enterprise solution to to have iOS

00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:24,440
devices for everyone then comes the part

00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:26,270
of understanding so if you want to take

00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,940
our legacy it's very good if you

00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:33,320
understand the context of that why the

00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:35,690
decisions were made when where and so on

00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:40,040
you can use this more framework to ask

00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:42,500
the right questions also regarding

00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,360
empathy think about yourself like how do

00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,640
you react to pressure how you deal with

00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,830
deadlines how you deal with unexpected

00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:51,380
things that happen in your project and

00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:53,959
also what is your technical and even

00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:57,140
your family background when we have a

00:14:53,959 --> 00:15:00,140
project usually we try to deal with this

00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:04,790
triangle so we try to play with that but

00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:07,100
it's not only about that like does

00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:09,140
anyone here never got affected by the

00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:13,850
things that are now outside the triangle

00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:16,880
I was affected and unfortunately I left

00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:22,880
this affect the project but it happens

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:25,370
it's like it's my life as well so trying

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,040
to think about the people that wrote the

00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:30,770
project that took the decisions so

00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:35,990
basically how they would react to all

00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:38,150
the situations and also from a more

00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:41,270
technical perspective you can also

00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:44,060
tackle the codebase directly so there

00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:46,550
are resources those two books regarding

00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:48,769
refactoring and testing they can be very

00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:52,309
very useful for dealing with flag

00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:55,610
sykov basis so just wrap up this post

00:15:52,309 --> 00:15:58,879
legacy try to understand the context be

00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:01,189
empathetic with the developers the

00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:03,829
project project product managers that

00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:06,199
working in our in your company before or

00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:08,749
in the product you are working and also

00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:11,329
consider the the resources like books

00:16:08,749 --> 00:16:13,040
blog posts whatever is available to

00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:13,959
support you when dealing with the

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,410
codebase

00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:21,559
now the pre legacy I know it's a bit

00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:23,540
inverted but basically usually we we

00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:25,910
take over the legacy from other people

00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:29,179
but sometimes we are writing new things

00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:33,709
so the pre legacy means the part that we

00:16:29,179 --> 00:16:36,259
are writing new software so there's this

00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:39,949
famous quote from Alan Perlis about list

00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:42,110
programmers and rich Ricci changed a bit

00:16:39,949 --> 00:16:44,179
so basically programmers know the

00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:49,160
benefits or the value of everything

00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:51,649
without knowing the costs so basically

00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:54,379
try to align expectations with your

00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:56,749
stakeholders your colleagues everyone in

00:16:54,379 --> 00:16:58,459
your team about the value that you are

00:16:56,749 --> 00:17:01,970
bringing with the solutions that you are

00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:03,980
taking and also the cost also learning

00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:06,679
and hiring should also be considered and

00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:09,889
it's also related with the multi-armed

00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:12,589
bandit problem where the bandit has so

00:17:09,889 --> 00:17:15,740
many different weapons to use that he

00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:18,529
gets lost and cannot finish his job so

00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:22,309
try to think about that also when

00:17:18,529 --> 00:17:24,470
evaluating tools consider a framework so

00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:27,829
try to evaluate multiple tools to solve

00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:32,960
the same problem there are many of them

00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:35,600
out there experiment so get your choice

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,090
or your choices experiment with

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,220
hackathons try to have a time with your

00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:42,139
team where you are going to work with

00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:47,750
that without touching production

00:17:42,139 --> 00:17:51,440
directly and also when considering the

00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:53,480
MVP try also to consider the are a team

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,580
or riskiest assumption tests where you

00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:57,139
are going not to tackle the simple

00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:59,240
problem that you have but you are going

00:17:57,139 --> 00:18:00,770
to tackle a problem that is more

00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:02,870
difficult but you are going to validate

00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:06,260
your idea bet in a bed

00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:08,780
also when experimentation avoid the the

00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:12,170
beer Trappe of following the Spotify

00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:15,380
model like blindly usually we see this

00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:19,100
model every time I see this I'm afraid

00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:21,440
of having this happening like as soon as

00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,510
you ship something people will ask to

00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,820
ship something else and no no we don't

00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:29,930
need to drop that it's working fine just

00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:33,980
what is your beam or something else and

00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:35,540
there is also this this other context

00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,180
for the same approach where you try to

00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:41,780
build incrementally without discarding

00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:43,730
what you build before it so there's a

00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:49,040
very good blog post about this as well

00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:50,420
so regarding implementation every time

00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:52,730
it's possible try to isolate

00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:56,060
dependencies and avoid bringing

00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:58,660
buzzwords into your domain so try to

00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:02,090
keep your business domain clear of

00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:03,950
buzzwords I also be skeptical about

00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:08,900
frameworks and try to use more libraries

00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:11,630
basically from object orientation like

00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:15,230
try to keep things not so couple

00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:18,350
together regarding documentation don't

00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:20,150
be afraid of expressing what you want to

00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:22,130
do with the project even if you don't

00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:25,610
have time to finish it may help someone

00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:27,800
later also there's the ad ours

00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:30,290
they are basically records that you can

00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:33,500
write for every decision you are taking

00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:36,830
if you consider it's a very valid point

00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:40,490
to explain to someone later or even to

00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:42,740
yourself your future self it's very good

00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:44,450
to take notes of that also document

00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:48,620
incidents it's also important for

00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:51,860
learning so now just to wrap up legacies

00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:54,470
are usually time-sensitive and some

00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:58,070
buzzwords too we know that artificial

00:19:54,470 --> 00:20:00,590
intelligence is it's still there and

00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:02,600
some people if you search for it some

00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:05,510
people are mentioning that there will be

00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:07,730
like a third AI winter we don't know

00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:10,280
exactly what is going to happen and I

00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:12,290
don't I don't have a clear idea yet to

00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:14,540
make my bets

00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:16,130
software engineer is this to a young

00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:19,070
industry

00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:21,230
when dealing with legacies that you are

00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:23,870
taking over from other teams or from

00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:26,809
other people understand the context

00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:29,030
being pathetic use resources that you

00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:33,799
have available for you like the books I
