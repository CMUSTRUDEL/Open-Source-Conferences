Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2019: Holden Karau – State of diversity in open source communities #bbuzz
Publication date: 2019-07-02
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2019 #bbuzz
Description: 
	Holden Karau talking about "State of diversity in open source communities: A bi exploration of correlations, draw your own inference".

Open Source projects are a medium to expose engineers to innovation, other cultures and fast-track ways to learn more about the new leading technologies. Representation in the world of Open Source contribution has the opportunity to benefit not only the participants but the broader society. While there are many intersectional aspects to diversity, this talk will focus on diversity of region of contributors and gender as these are easier to analyze and we have more personal experience with them. Together we will explore data from projects in the Apache Software Foundation, Linux Foundation, and Jupyter family of projects.

Topics include:
- Diversity of representation of gender, working hours, and region among the different levels of a given project’s leadership (committers, PMC, etc.)
- Source of project origination
- The existence of codes of conduct
- And how creating a welcoming environment helps diversity
- Language & time of communication in comments, code, and mailing lists
- The rate & sources of promotions for project participants
- The importance of recognizing non-code contributions and how projects with better process are more diverse

	00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:11,000
so yeah I'm gonna talk about

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,580
diversity in open-source communities I

00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,930
want to be really clear that these are

00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:21,680
only correlations I'm not claiming any

00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:23,270
causal links one way or another we can

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,259
we can certainly talk about what they

00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:28,550
might be but the the methodologies used

00:00:27,259 --> 00:00:30,820
are not such that I really feel

00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:33,769
comfortable claiming any causal links

00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:36,320
and yeah this is me

00:00:33,769 --> 00:00:37,850
this is boo she is my co-presenter you

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,230
may recognize her from the morning's

00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:42,579
keynote where she was hanging out with

00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:44,750
grits she is she's really good on stage

00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:46,489
so yeah I'm holding my preferred

00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:49,090
pronouns are she or her I am a developer

00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:51,230
advocate at Google I'm on the SPARC PMC

00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:53,059
which means it's really hard to get me

00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:55,789
off of the SPARC project which is good

00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:58,219
because I like SPARC and I contribute to

00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:59,210
a lot of other Apache projects I've

00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:01,789
worked at a whole bunch of other

00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:05,449
companies they were all very nice people

00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:08,899
and paid me money I'm a co-author of two

00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:10,910
books which are unrelated to any of the

00:01:08,899 --> 00:01:15,340
content discussed here but that should

00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:17,209
not stop you from buying them especially

00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,950
high-performance SPARC I got a much

00:01:17,209 --> 00:01:21,590
better royalty deal on that one it turns

00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,869
out you can negotiate if anyone's

00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:27,170
interested in sort of seeing open-source

00:01:23,869 --> 00:01:28,550
code reviews live streamed I think it's

00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,830
more interesting than watching paint dry

00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:32,780
you may disagree you can check out my

00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:35,209
youtube channel here and you can sort of

00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,429
see the thought process that goes into

00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:39,920
at least how I do my open-source code

00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:42,289
reviews and sometimes people join and

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,700
there's chats and people find issues

00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:46,160
that I wouldn't have found and we get to

00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,080
have those conversations I've got a

00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:50,020
bunch of random SPARC videos because

00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:52,399
that's a lot of what I do as well

00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:54,979
in addition to I am professionally I'm

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,920
trans queer Canadian in America on an

00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:58,520
h-1b work visa that expires on April 20

00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,039
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,349
I could figure out what today because

00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:06,229
that's coming up and part of the leather

00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:07,789
community and this is actually more

00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:09,619
related to this talk than normal

00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:11,270
normally I'm talking about SPARC and I'm

00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:12,650
just like and we should you know talk

00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,510
about where we're all from but I think

00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,099
actually it's really important for us to

00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,780
talk about where we're all from in

00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:19,090
open-source communities because that's

00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:21,920
sort of the first step to understanding

00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:23,660
what our community looks like and if we

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,849
know what our community looks like we

00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:28,489
don't know if we need to improve

00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:30,050
diversity or what sort of facets we

00:02:28,489 --> 00:02:31,280
might want to think about so if you're

00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,180
an in an open source community I

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,849
encourage you to have these

00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,989
conversations with other people you know

00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:37,640
especially if you're in the project

00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,319
management of it like where they're all

00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,140
from what their backgrounds are what

00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:44,360
people's biases might be and so let's

00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:47,600
say a conversation and so obviously this

00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,069
gives me a set of biases that exact

00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:52,910
details of which are like I believe

00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:54,380
universal health care is amazing and I

00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,000
am slightly terrified for the

00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,640
immigration changes happening in America

00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,470
and and other things like this right but

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,760
you know this gives me one set of views

00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:05,330
and another set of views could be

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,780
important too so yeah what is this all

00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,760
about

00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,049
open source is really important you're

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,850
all here at a conference about it so

00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:13,430
that's probably something you already

00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:15,470
care about and there's also the other

00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,790
part is there's not a lot of metrics

00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:19,340
around diversity in open source

00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:21,440
communities there's their summon and I

00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:23,660
link to some of them at the end for some

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,700
of the other studies but it's also this

00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,140
wishful thinking that maybe if we

00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,630
actually measure some of these metrics

00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:32,209
maybe we can do better right

00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:34,370
maybe the act of measuring will cause us

00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:35,750
to find ways to improve right there's

00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:37,310
this old saying that what gets measured

00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,049
is what gets improved

00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:41,390
and I think this can be true in open

00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:43,370
source communities as well also I want

00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:46,549
to be clear like these analytics like

00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:48,950
they're there in my github I'm certainly

00:03:46,549 --> 00:03:51,650
a mediocre data scientist I mostly make

00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:53,299
tools for data scientists so if you are

00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:56,030
someone who really likes doing data

00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:58,100
analytics please join me and and I would

00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:02,150
love to do more interesting analytics

00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:04,670
here okay and so with that I don't know

00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:08,540
if any of you read the news but perhaps

00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:11,299
my employer has perhaps not had the best

00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,680
most recent reputation about certain

00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:16,039
aspects of which I'm going to be

00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:17,479
discussing I enjoy being paid and I

00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:21,079
working at what's called an at-will

00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:24,800
state so that is all I'm gonna say about

00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:28,280
that but to be really clear I'm worrying

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,849
my personal hat that is not my google

00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,950
hat right I'm very grateful for Google

00:04:31,849 --> 00:04:35,870
for supporting this work but these are

00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,490
definitely my own personal views

00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,900
and not necessarily those of Google

00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:40,480
Google may disagree with some of my

00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,610
thoughts

00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:46,160
cool so one of one of the things that

00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:47,660
that I found really fascinating sort of

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,340
that motivated me to swim these I don't

00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,500
know that X was I was reading this book

00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:54,530
called the good girls revolt which is

00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:57,530
about the equal employment opportunities

00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:59,660
Commission in America in the 60s and one

00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,830
of the one of the things that people

00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,350
said in response to some of the

00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:05,090
complaints there and it was writers come

00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:07,730
to the magazine over the transom and

00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:09,980
women aren't coming we can't do anything

00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:12,470
if they aren't interested has anyone

00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:15,770
heard something similar to that in our

00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:18,140
open source communities yeah and that's

00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:19,700
that's a lot of nodding heads for those

00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,410
of you watching the recording you can

00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:25,130
trust me on this one but even if you

00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:27,290
don't we can see RMS perhaps saying

00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:30,290
something pretty similar about Emacs and

00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:32,780
GCC right and so I think that there's

00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:34,550
this belief that you know it's not our

00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:37,310
problem it's just that people aren't

00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,810
interested and I think I think some of

00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:42,590
these analytics might suggest that

00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:46,790
that's not the case right there are some

00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:49,790
recent studies this was this one's

00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:51,620
depressing home researchers found

00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:53,480
women's coding suggestions were accepted

00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,300
71% of the time when their gender was

00:05:53,480 --> 00:06:00,310
kept secret and 62% of the time when

00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:04,070
their gender was revealed I mean that's

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:08,060
that's a difference and also there there

00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:10,310
was just like 25% of the women surveyed

00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,080
reported being exposed to language or

00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,310
content that made them uncomfortable now

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,810
that's that's definitely a thing with

00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,390
cross-cultural communication that can

00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:18,530
happen unintentionally certainly I've

00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:22,040
occasionally made people uncomfortable

00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:27,710
by saying certain words that rhyme with

00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:29,210
truck because I don't know to me that's

00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:31,130
very normal but to other people it makes

00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:33,500
them feel very uncomfortable and I I try

00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:35,540
and not do this but it's it's the thing

00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,760
and this is one of the things which

00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:39,620
actually made me wonder maybe there's

00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,900
something in the language of a project

00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:43,190
which might be correlated with project

00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,290
diversity maybe there's something there

00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:47,680
I should do some analytics here and try

00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,680
and explore

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,000
so what have we done and so it's just me

00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:55,979
and blue on stage and while I love blue

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,960
she didn't do any of the programming I

00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:59,850
had some some lovely help and there's a

00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,410
call outside to that later but so when I

00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:04,350
use we it's not the Royal we I'm not

00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:07,530
that into myself but so we pull data

00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:10,650
from get meet up and we did some machine

00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:17,490
learning also known as statistics but

00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:19,139
with less principles and then I also use

00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:22,229
some humans because I was like you know

00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:24,060
what maybe I should do some surveys that

00:07:22,229 --> 00:07:26,370
might be kind of interesting and we made

00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:28,500
some pretty ish pictures they weren't

00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:31,350
very good but I did find a lot of cat

00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,600
pictures so just sort of average out the

00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:36,740
cuteness of the cat and the graph on all

00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:40,260
of the slides and and this will be okay

00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:42,090
all right so to be clear this is this is

00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:44,639
just correlation this is not causation

00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:47,310
this is also not legal advice or

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,669
academic quality data lawyer cat would

00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:53,310
be very upset if I was implying that any

00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:56,580
of these things were legal advice and my

00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:59,490
reference to the EEOC was simply for

00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:01,740
comparison in no way implying that there

00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:04,700
could be any direct relationship here

00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:09,510
please don't sue me or my boss okay

00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:12,599
moving on so git commits messages we

00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:14,580
infer gender we got humans to review

00:08:12,599 --> 00:08:15,990
projects and guess at the gender of the

00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:18,479
participants based on the information

00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:21,120
about the participants we looked at

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,650
project websites mailing lists and then

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,750
there's this bitly link which takes you

00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:29,970
to the github where all of this lids and

00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:33,510
pull requests are actually welcome for

00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:38,310
real okay cool so what does what was the

00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:39,630
data so I looked at about 50 projects 30

00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:43,770
gigs of commits and posts from those

00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:45,959
projects the human review was obviously

00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,670
sampled down because my budget was

00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:50,010
limited to that of what I thought I

00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:51,930
could put on my corporate card without

00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:53,949
my boss noticing which is about a

00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:56,350
hundred dollars

00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:58,839
so there was $100 worth of human review

00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:02,559
I actually did it three times so it was

00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:07,170
it was $300 worth of human review but

00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:10,689
spread out over a few months of planning

00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:12,730
and if you're watching this Eric I'm

00:09:10,689 --> 00:09:19,779
sorry and thanks for approving those

00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:21,489
expense reports okay cool and then okay

00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:22,869
then we also we had slightly different

00:09:21,489 --> 00:09:24,549
data that we used for the country

00:09:22,869 --> 00:09:26,980
contributions and we looked at 11 gigs

00:09:24,549 --> 00:09:29,259
worth of commits for that and we also

00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:31,629
only looked at individuals with at least

00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:33,189
one commit in a one-year window from the

00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:37,509
time that I took the snapshot of the

00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:38,769
data and so that narrowed it down enough

00:09:37,509 --> 00:09:41,109
that I could afford to do this with

00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:43,389
under $300 it's not a very principled

00:09:41,109 --> 00:09:47,739
window it was just this was the window

00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:51,069
that gave me work with my budgets so the

00:09:47,739 --> 00:09:52,720
human data collection was done with

00:09:51,069 --> 00:09:56,319
these instructions that are certainly

00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,419
not perfect and it depends on the

00:09:56,319 --> 00:10:03,069
cultural bias of random humans from the

00:09:58,419 --> 00:10:04,720
internet who I can hire from a website

00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:08,079
whose name I'm not gonna mention because

00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:09,339
I enjoy being employed but we asked them

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,299
to find the gender of the user in

00:10:09,339 --> 00:10:12,100
question

00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:13,660
we gave them some sample emails that

00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:16,389
have been sent in response to the user

00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:18,189
on the mailing list so this this brings

00:10:16,389 --> 00:10:20,230
in the bias of other people on the

00:10:18,189 --> 00:10:22,360
mailing list but the hope was that maybe

00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:23,709
people in the project would use the

00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,600
correct pronouns for the people they

00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:27,239
were interacting with especially if

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,279
they've been on the project for a while

00:10:27,239 --> 00:10:31,980
and so so the hope was the human

00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:34,389
reviewer could extract that information

00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,989
and then we also told them to feel free

00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:40,629
to search online and we try to infer

00:10:37,989 --> 00:10:42,819
LinkedIn and Twitter information for

00:10:40,629 --> 00:10:44,919
users some people listed in there like

00:10:42,819 --> 00:10:46,689
ASF stuff but that only really worked

00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:48,759
for the very prolific contributors the

00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:50,379
the smaller contributors tended to have

00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:52,799
less information than their profile so

00:10:50,379 --> 00:10:57,249
there's definitely some bias introduced

00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:59,619
there as well and then we also asked

00:10:57,249 --> 00:11:01,600
them to list to all of the resources

00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:04,809
that they use to try and further this

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,819
users gender so that when I another

00:11:04,809 --> 00:11:07,800
month goes by I can pay someone else

00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:10,139
$100

00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,970
on that corporate card to look through

00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:13,529
the data and do a do a double check but

00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:15,300
I have to wait for the next billing

00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:18,269
cycle to come around otherwise Eric is

00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:20,459
gonna start to get suspicious so step

00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:22,800
one any any good data scientist starts

00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:24,899
with eyeballing well hmm okay at least I

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,850
always start with eyeballing cuz I don't

00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:28,350
know what the hell I'm doing so let's

00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:31,350
take a look and once some of this data

00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:34,589
looks like so if we group together by

00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:36,449
project and we look at the inferred

00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:38,790
non-male percentage and the sampled

00:11:36,449 --> 00:11:41,629
non-male percentage and so we ask people

00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:44,220
you know what gender people weren't and

00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:47,339
there was only one person in the entire

00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,499
dataset who came back as non-binary

00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:51,179
everyone else was male or female and

00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:53,429
that represents obviously the bias of

00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:55,019
the reviewers to a degree but that's

00:11:53,429 --> 00:11:56,939
that's why non male rather than female

00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:59,069
and we can see there's there's a really

00:11:56,939 --> 00:12:00,509
tall bar and so that that's an exciting

00:11:59,069 --> 00:12:03,389
tall bar

00:12:00,509 --> 00:12:05,579
there's also another bar in here which

00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:07,649
is not from the ASF so I also looked at

00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:09,600
some some projects from Jupiter because

00:12:07,649 --> 00:12:12,089
I wanted to see like maybe the ASF is

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,999
doing really well or really poorly and

00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:17,100
the Jupiter projects tend to be doing a

00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:19,069
little bit better than the ASF projects

00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,629
in terms of diversity which is

00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:24,299
interesting there could be something at

00:12:21,629 --> 00:12:27,240
a foundation level there but then

00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:30,449
there's also CouchDB as a SF project

00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:34,679
relatively high diversity for for these

00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:37,139
projects and they actually do a bunch of

00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:39,600
explicit outreach as well which which

00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:41,429
could be correlated hopefully their

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,379
explicit outreach actually does have

00:12:41,429 --> 00:12:45,449
some effect and and that's what's more

00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:49,470
seeing or reflected here on the data but

00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:50,819
it could also be something else and

00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:53,100
right yeah so there are limitations that

00:12:50,819 --> 00:12:55,049
apply this may under or over account in

00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:58,379
certain situations because it's samples

00:12:55,049 --> 00:13:00,959
and computers are terrible okay so what

00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:03,660
is that really tall bar it's this

00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,919
project called the rivet I don't

00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,139
actually know how to pronounce it it's

00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:08,910
an Apache project apparently I found

00:13:07,139 --> 00:13:10,259
that out by going to their website no I

00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:12,389
found that out because it was in my data

00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:14,669
set and they've they've got this list of

00:13:12,389 --> 00:13:17,040
people working on it it's kind of neat

00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:18,809
they actually list the time zones on

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,029
there like people working on this page

00:13:18,809 --> 00:13:21,270
which I thought was kind of cool from

00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:23,370
like

00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:24,960
collaboration point of view that seems

00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:26,760
kind of useful information to know I

00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:28,050
happen to know that in the spark

00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:31,140
community for the people that I work

00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:32,340
with but certainly you know in new

00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:35,100
projects I'm just like I don't know

00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:38,940
who's awake let me just try pinging

00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:40,620
random humans so there are some things

00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:43,380
that like could be unique about that

00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:45,420
project right one of the things is if we

00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,640
if we look at the people they're coming

00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:51,300
from a wide variety of different

00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:52,890
organizations relative to perhaps the

00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,000
project that I work on Apache spark

00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:56,190
which might be a little bit more

00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,380
concentrated with one or two key

00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:00,690
employers as it were

00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:03,450
it hasn't easy to find community page

00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:04,770
there's really good instructions on how

00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:06,990
to get involved directly from the

00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:09,720
project homepage and also interestingly

00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:12,030
enough it has a lot of academic backing

00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,130
so there was a knowledge of National

00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:16,430
Science Foundation backing and so maybe

00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:18,570
that encouraged more people sort of from

00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:20,910
academia to get involved and maybe that

00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:22,440
helps improve these numbers they also

00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,760
participated in google Summer of Code

00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,500
which was kind of interesting and maybe

00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,680
that was another way that they got

00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:30,900
people involved so that's those those

00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:33,540
are some things you know this isn't like

00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:35,190
a very statistically significant sample

00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,840
we're looking at one project but

00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:38,400
certainly we're looking at the one

00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,970
project which definitely stood out the

00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:44,780
most so that's kind of cool but stage

00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:47,780
two we're going to apply science to this

00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:50,580
and science is when we empty a beer can

00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:54,690
into something else and then we go back

00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:58,370
in time okay the Back to the Future

00:14:54,690 --> 00:15:00,780
didn't was not so popular in Germany

00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:02,100
okay it was my jokes are just bad that's

00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,980
fine okay

00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,720
so that's great but I don't really have

00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:09,120
the time to go and dig into every

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,460
individual project at scale right that

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,690
would cost more than my three hundred

00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:16,890
dollar budget and I'm lazy so these are

00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,450
some of the things that we could

00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:21,000
programmatically figure out to a degree

00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:23,940
and I've used humans to to look and see

00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,890
if there was a code of conduct and the

00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:28,260
contributor guide but we can look at

00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:29,820
things like the sentiment of the project

00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,890
on the user dev list using sentiment

00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,570
analysis and maybe we'll see something

00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,660
interesting

00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:38,300
with the language based on our earlier

00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:39,800
study about women intending to

00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,090
experience language that made them

00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,030
uncomfortable so maybe there's something

00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:45,410
there so there's some gender related

00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,730
attributes that we can think of we can

00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:48,680
think of the gender percentages of the

00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:50,570
code contributions we could look at the

00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,160
mailing list users there's a lot of

00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:54,290
mailing list users and coming up with

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,410
this disability significant sample of

00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:59,780
them cost more than $300 sorry I didn't

00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:01,790
do it and we can also look at the gender

00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:03,920
percentages of the project management

00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:05,810
group and the people who are committing

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,980
code and then we can look and see which

00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:09,140
one of these are correlated with

00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:13,520
different things and we can maybe this

00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:15,530
will tell us happy things so I did both

00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:17,360
samples and inferred gender information

00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:21,380
if you look at these two graphs you'll

00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:25,430
notice they're different which is not

00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:28,250
great this points to perhaps either data

00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:30,800
quality with humans or data quality with

00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:32,660
machines one of the two is perhaps less

00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,880
than ideal but there there are some

00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,350
similarities and let's dive into to one

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,570
of those graphs and take a look oh

00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:41,750
actually let's talk about why this might

00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:43,040
be the case so infer gender is known to

00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:46,370
have a lot of issues especially with

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,650
non-american names they tend to pull

00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:50,480
from like historical census data and so

00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:53,690
it also is biased towards like older

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:56,000
names trans folks like the computer is

00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,980
going to say that I'm a dude I mean to

00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,130
be fair like 20% of people will - but

00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:03,950
you know there's there's some bias there

00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:06,350
- it could also be the place where they

00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:08,630
differed was on the the impact of

00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:10,670
sentiment to a degree it could be that

00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:12,080
our sentiment detection is off I don't I

00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:14,870
don't think so I think the sentiment

00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:16,190
detection is probably okay but if you've

00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:17,830
got an idea of different things we

00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:21,830
should explore on sentiment detection

00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:23,570
definitely let me know but yeah so

00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:26,170
what's our what's our first look so we

00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:28,370
can see that the positive sentiment is

00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:30,410
correlated with increased diversity and

00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:32,420
negative sentiment is to a degree

00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:34,220
negatively oh well okay I can see that

00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:37,370
we'll look at another graph where we

00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:39,230
have these labels readable but if you

00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:40,670
trust me negative sentiment is

00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:43,250
negatively correlated and we can see

00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:45,200
there's slightly different amounts of

00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:46,010
correlation depending on exactly which

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,190
thresholds where you

00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:52,400
for considering and mailing was bad and

00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:54,080
then there's also depressingly the

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,650
existence of a mentoring guide is

00:17:54,080 --> 00:18:00,350
negatively correlated which was

00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:04,760
surprising we'll talk about that more

00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:06,860
later and perhaps I mean in a nice way

00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,390
we do see that the inferred non mail

00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:10,250
percentage and the sampled non mail

00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:12,230
percentages are strongly correlated

00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,640
together if they weren't I would be very

00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:15,770
worried about our data quality but they

00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:17,300
are strongly correlated so even though

00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:21,320
there are some questions around data

00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:23,510
quality it is good enough for for me so

00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:27,620
if we if we just focus on mailing lists

00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:30,530
we can see that the average negative

00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:33,020
sentiment and the 90th quantile negative

00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:37,130
sentiment are both negatively correlated

00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:41,690
with increased diversity on a project

00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:44,750
and the positive ones are are also

00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:46,400
positively correlated so I mean this

00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,050
doesn't necessarily give us a causal

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,960
link right like maybe more diverse

00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:53,540
projects tend to have more neutral or

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,190
positive sentiment in that you know we

00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,960
may just be aware that we're

00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:58,520
communicating across cultural boundaries

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,970
like how I learned not to say things

00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:04,460
that rhyme with truck or it could be

00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:07,370
that you know people are turned away

00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:08,810
from this when they see negative things

00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:10,970
on the mailing list it's it's hard to

00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:12,860
say which one it is but I would

00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:16,040
encourage you to to use this information

00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:17,300
to perhaps get rid of the on

00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,580
your mailing list insofar as you can

00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:21,920
because they probably weren't adding a

00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:24,940
lot anyways and it might help you

00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:27,860
increase the diversity of your project

00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:34,640
okay so the the committer guide that one

00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:36,050
was bad okay so on on on a positive side

00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,530
non mail committer percentage is

00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:42,470
strongly correlated with increased

00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:44,360
diversity of contributors and this could

00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:45,920
just be that were like pulling from that

00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:48,080
contributor pool to make our committers

00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:50,210
and that's good right like if this was

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,320
not strongly correlated that would make

00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:53,060
me sad that would mean that we're not

00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:57,080
like pulling from that pool we're just

00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:58,460
pulling from the pool of dudes and so

00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,090
this is this is good

00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,500
or

00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:02,840
could also be that having nominal

00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:06,830
committers tends to attract more non

00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:10,190
male contributors who knows but yeah

00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:13,040
whatever it's cool on inferred data it

00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:15,860
looks pretty similar but the the exact

00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:18,220
values are a little bit different and so

00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:20,600
that's that's reassuring to a degree

00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:24,950
it's not quite the same but it's you

00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:26,750
know it's good so yeah interestingly

00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:29,020
enough the code of conduct being

00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:32,080
explicitly declared on the project page

00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:35,420
was was not correlated it was just

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:40,010
neutral and this could be that we're

00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:41,570
pulling from ASF projects right all ASF

00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:43,220
projects are like part of the Apache

00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:45,380
Software Foundation which does have a

00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:47,240
code of conduct so it could just be like

00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:49,490
kind of neutral when your project says

00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,870
it because like in practice yeah we're

00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:55,220
all supposed to be not to each

00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:58,610
other or maybe it's something else the

00:20:55,220 --> 00:21:00,230
mentoring I want to really confuse me I

00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:02,390
don't have a good explanation for that

00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:04,010
but that's okay you you all can come up

00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:06,280
with a reason for that this does not

00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:08,720
mean go delete your mentoring guides

00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,520
this just means like maybe take a look

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,650
at them maybe the mentoring guides tend

00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,690
to have language which makes people not

00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:15,980
happy maybe there's something there and

00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:18,350
our meandering guides that we should dig

00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,790
into and see what's going on maybe

00:21:18,350 --> 00:21:23,330
there's there's some opportunities for

00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:25,160
improvement there so one of the other

00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:28,760
things that I was curious about is the

00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:30,770
impact of programming language and this

00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:33,530
did not match my expectations at all

00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:34,910
when I made this chart yesterday well

00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:36,470
actually technically this morning

00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:39,530
because I reran it because I didn't

00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:42,440
trust myself but we can see here that

00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:45,050
some languages are you know they they

00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:47,480
seem to have higher percentages so this

00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:49,490
is I should I should explain this is the

00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:53,180
programming language and this is the

00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:55,820
min/max and average of the projects that

00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:58,220
are have that as the primary programming

00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:01,100
language of what their diversity numbers

00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:03,530
are on gender and python is just zero

00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:05,960
across the board which is not the answer

00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:07,670
I was expecting right and one of the

00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,440
things is that this is actually just on

00:22:07,670 --> 00:22:11,840
the NSF data it's not on the Jupiter

00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,860
data if it was on the Jupiter data and

00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,299
it gave me back zero

00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,850
the board I would have been like mmm

00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:19,100
well it's time to delete that graph but

00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:23,809
if we dig into this we can see there's

00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:26,270
not a lot of Apache projects with Python

00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:27,770
as their primary detected language so

00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:29,330
each project was only assigned one

00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:31,040
language and it was whichever one github

00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:35,390
decided to assign to it which we all

00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:37,460
know is perfect but you know perhaps you

00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:41,000
know one could argue that that spark

00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:43,670
really should be Scala and Python and

00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,610
then we'd get different numbers but this

00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:48,500
was the the easier approach and so since

00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:50,780
there's only like one or two projects in

00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:53,870
the Python one I think we should

00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:55,190
probably just discount this field and we

00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:57,590
can look at the other ones other ones

00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:03,080
all have some reasonable number of

00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:05,179
projects in them and this is interesting

00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:07,010
we can see that there is certainly a

00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:11,350
fair amount of variance inside of some

00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:14,809
languages so we can see that there are

00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:16,850
more diverse skala projects and less

00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:19,010
diverse Scala project so it's not simply

00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:21,110
a matter of reflecting the programming

00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:22,190
language that we're pulling from we can

00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:23,809
certainly see that there's a difference

00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:25,490
between the min and the max and the

00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:27,140
average there so that's kind of

00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:29,480
interesting right we can't just use the

00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:32,299
programming language excuse and just be

00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:34,130
like no one likes Java because it turns

00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:35,990
out some people really do who aren't

00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:37,760
male and and they contribute to ASF

00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,770
projects right and that's that's really

00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:43,220
awesome so it's not just that we use

00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:48,669
Java a lot not that there's anything

00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:53,120
wrong with Java well there is a lot but

00:23:48,669 --> 00:23:58,429
okay yeah okay so so the other question

00:23:53,120 --> 00:24:00,580
which I had because how many of you have

00:23:58,429 --> 00:24:03,110
become a committer on an Apache project

00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:08,870
okay keep your hands up if you felt that

00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:11,780
process was fair and easy okay so it got

00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:14,150
cut by half and so one of the things

00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:17,720
that I was curious is you know perhaps

00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:20,169
it's it's possible that because many

00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:23,120
projects tend to submit tend to select

00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:24,980
committers by consensus voting that

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,460
maybe we're allowing biases Don

00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,890
intention

00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:29,960
creep into that process right consensus

00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:32,179
voting is like everyone agrees no one

00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:36,470
vetoes and this is how you end up eating

00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:38,840
at in America the Olive Garden oh sorry

00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:42,020
no no the Cheesecake Factory Cheesecake

00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:44,690
Factory okay you do not have olive

00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:46,070
garden or Cheesecake Factory here but

00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:48,500
it's how you end up eating somewhere

00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:50,000
really bland and mediocre right when

00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,309
you're just like all of your friends

00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,250
anyone who has any objection can just be

00:24:52,309 --> 00:25:02,029
like no right and so maybe this is

00:24:55,250 --> 00:25:04,370
leading tool blender project makeup it

00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:06,169
looks like maybe not so much we tend to

00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:09,230
see right as we saw in that correlation

00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:10,630
slide earlier that the there there is a

00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:13,580
correlation between the number of

00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:16,070
non-male contributors and the number of

00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:18,080
non-male committers and we we tend to

00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:20,230
see that broken out for most projects

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:25,909
some of them though are certainly very

00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:29,360
different and if you want you can look

00:25:25,909 --> 00:25:31,549
at this graph later with like a

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,649
magnifying glass or you can go to the

00:25:31,549 --> 00:25:35,630
the the bitly link where the thing

00:25:33,649 --> 00:25:42,380
notebook is and you can you can look at

00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:44,870
this graph specifically yeah okay so

00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:47,360
gender is one of many aspects of

00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:49,730
diversity of a project there's also

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,110
where people are from and it turns out

00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:55,250
there are a lot of people from Germany

00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:57,260
so a good job the u.s. is probably

00:25:55,250 --> 00:26:00,350
undercounted here on the basis of that

00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:02,390
whole calm thing which was just blew

00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:04,460
everything out of the water but calm is

00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:06,770
is sufficiently popular for just all

00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:09,200
commercial organizations regardless of

00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:11,600
country that it was kind of difficult to

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,240
figure out where folks were from and so

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,159
this is this is kind of interesting we

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:20,630
see this this trail off Canada is here

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:24,049
yeah anyone else from Canada yeah go

00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:26,330
team okay so like Canada is in the top

00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:29,299
five and like as Canadians I feel like

00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:32,260
that's the Canadian version of gold so

00:26:29,299 --> 00:26:32,260
you know

00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:36,130
you don't want to be number one right

00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:40,150
because then that's that's just wolf

00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:41,740
that's a lot of apologies sorry

00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:43,600
cultural stereotypes um but they're

00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:46,210
there for my own culture so I think it's

00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,990
okay that's how it works right okay

00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:50,080
moving on

00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:51,940
uh-huh okay and so if we if we take

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,490
uniques rather than just looking at all

00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:58,300
of the contributions right so if like I

00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:59,260
contribute 100 patches to to spark as

00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,360
you know

00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:04,720
do we count me as one or 100 and if we

00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:06,310
do this the graph ends up looking pretty

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,430
much the same so it turns out that it's

00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:10,660
not just like there's a bot in Germany

00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:13,360
that's contributing hundreds of

00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:15,760
thousands of patches well there may be

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,680
but that's not the only reason why or if

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,600
there is that bot is changing its email

00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,550
address a lot and you're probably gonna

00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,610
get banned from the github API so okay

00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:27,220
so this is this is kind of interesting

00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:28,990
there too and there's there's a lot of

00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,910
other facets that we could explore here

00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:33,850
besides gender but they're all really

00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:35,560
hard and when you will have a budget of

00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:39,160
about whatever you can sneak past your

00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:41,410
boss it's not a great budget right and

00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:44,230
so I really think that if we should

00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:45,940
explore a lot of these things we often

00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:48,280
talk about diversity of employers and

00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:49,690
Apache projects and I think that would

00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:52,660
be a good thing for us to explicitly

00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:54,400
study outside of just you know PMC and

00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:56,080
committers I think it makes sense to

00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,210
look where the contributions on the

00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,160
mailing list are coming from

00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:02,560
I think certainly all of these other

00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:05,050
facets are all really exciting too and

00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:08,110
we should we should explore them but I

00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:09,910
can't do it for $300 and so if anyone

00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:11,590
would save perhaps asking the ASF for

00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:13,060
money to do diversity work you know

00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:16,750
maybe this could be an interesting area

00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:19,240
that we could use to figure out where or

00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:21,630
how we should focus our efforts to truly

00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:24,100
reflect the world that we're serving

00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:29,080
there's a whole bunch of related work

00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:31,150
and it's all really depressing but if

00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:35,080
you're tired of being happy I encourage

00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:40,150
you to check out these links are as I

00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:43,210
like to say everything is awesome yes

00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:45,040
yes awesome right I don't actually if

00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:47,290
you want to see video

00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:50,170
of a spark committer struggling to use

00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:52,330
spark there's this lovely bitly link

00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:53,680
down at the bottom where and I try and

00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:56,800
use the software that I've worked on for

00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:58,990
six years and it turns out that the

00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:01,020
sufferer that I've worked on is have

00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:03,910
some opportunities for improvement to

00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:06,430
use a phrase that I've seen every

00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:08,890
performance review and so you can check

00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:11,110
that out there and hopefully that that

00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:12,790
makes you feel confident enough that you

00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:16,120
can help contribute to doing these

00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:18,880
analytics with me and special thanks

00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:22,840
this wasn't just me there were many

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:25,450
lovely people and Spencer who is my

00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:28,060
former Riley editor she's the head of

00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:30,910
content at Domino data lab did a lot of

00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:33,280
early work with me on this Matt gave an

00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:35,320
earlier version of this talk with me and

00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:39,640
pointed out that the graphs looked like

00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:42,640
 they still do but less so and I

00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:45,130
added cat pictures so that helps right

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:49,450
and and Chris did the geographic

00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:52,330
analysis which was it's very useful if

00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:55,960
you want to participate please come and

00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:57,910
join me doing this work by yourself is a

00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:00,430
really good way to feel really sad about

00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:02,380
the world and if you get multiple people

00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:03,850
together working on diversity stuff when

00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:07,660
you burn out you know you've got someone

00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:10,200
else to talk to so that's useful you but

00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:12,430
you might burn out I'm just fair warning

00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:14,770
and you could say hi I'm gonna be around

00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:17,020
Berlin for the next few days and if I

00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:19,900
manage to do like one business meeting

00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:21,990
between now and when I leave it'll look

00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:26,320
a lot less sketchy on my expense reports

00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:30,940
otherwise I'm swimming by the beam

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:32,770
summit okay so how does a book author of

00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:34,930
a book that is admittedly completely

00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:37,300
unrelated to this talk I would be remiss

00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:43,060
if I did not try and tell you about my

00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:45,730
book you should buy it okay great moving

00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:49,480
on if anyone is interested in teaching

00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:52,330
distributed computing to children and

00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:54,720
and this is this is not a joke this is

00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:58,340
actually a project that I'm working on

00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,570
distributed computing for kids comm you

00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:01,940
and give me your email address and

00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:05,360
because you're European I won't spam you

00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:09,080
I will selectively contact you for

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:14,320
business-related reasonings and there is

00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:14,320
an unsubscribe link as mandated by law

00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:19,310
anyways I think we can teach Apache

00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:21,980
spark to children preferably children

00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:25,970
who live in Europe and not America so I

00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:29,120
don't have to answer their questions and

00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:31,250
so that is my hope there okay so I

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,560
wanted to save the last of it for Q&A

00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:35,300
and we can discuss these analytics we

00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:38,690
can look at the notebook and you can see

00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:40,460
my really janky Python code know that

00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:43,070
I'm a scholar developer so that's my

00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:46,250
excuse but does does anyone have

00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:54,260
questions I would I would love to or

00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:57,080
thoughts questions anyone Oh clearly I

00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:58,550
am just an amazing public speaker who

00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:02,600
has answered everyone's possible

00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:09,590
questions yes does anyone want to look

00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:13,460
at a mediocre Python notebook oh that is

00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:17,260
not the answer I was expecting okay here

00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:20,120
is a mediocre Python notebook okay yeah

00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:22,430
so we can go up to the top okay

00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:25,310
we'll ignore all of the spark setup

00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:29,600
stuff because it's terrible okay more

00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:30,740
spark setup more spark setup Oh some

00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,650
things that really should be functions

00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:35,390
in spark moving past that okay here's

00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:37,730
where we extract the meetup data which I

00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:39,590
never got around to or analyzing if

00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:43,250
anyone wants to analyze the meetup data

00:32:39,590 --> 00:32:45,560
I have a bunch of it I think it would be

00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:46,880
interesting to see if maybe like having

00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:48,500
meetups in different countries is

00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,240
correlated with any of these things I

00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:54,620
think that could be a thing which might

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,760
actually be really relevant yeah and so

00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:58,880
there's a bunch of it that's just

00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:01,790
commented out because I do that we use

00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,700
Percival to extract a lot of data from

00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:07,040
github Thank You github for not blocking

00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:08,810
me I really appreciate that although

00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:11,120
they do occasionally if you run this

00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:12,140
notebook on your own be prepared to be

00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,270
rate limited

00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:18,280
by github but they don't they don't turn

00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:21,710
your account off not a guarantee uh okay

00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:23,420
save our data super happy fun times I

00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:26,120
import a Python library which is

00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:30,350
actually secretly a jar because I use

00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:36,410
SPARC we look at some users there's

00:33:30,350 --> 00:33:38,900
these two grant and Carl what's up then

00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:42,610
we use regular expressions two parts

00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:48,230
email addresses because I hate my life

00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:49,700
and yeah we also try and extract names

00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:51,110
from email addresses because I was going

00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:53,960
to try and do some analytics on the

00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:56,330
mailing list but that regular expression

00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,280
had some opportunities for improvement

00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:00,860
so if you like writing regular

00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:04,940
expressions come join me we look at the

00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:06,620
distinct authors we look up get up users

00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:08,450
by email address so we we got their

00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:09,800
commits and then we go and we find their

00:34:08,450 --> 00:34:11,870
github profile to try and get any

00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,340
information that might be present about

00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:15,110
them

00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:17,169
we also fetched their user BIOS some

00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:19,370
people put their pronouns in their bio

00:34:17,169 --> 00:34:21,380
please put your pronouns in your bio

00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:24,500
it's really helpful when I run this

00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:26,390
pipeline but also it's just good and it

00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,310
sort of normalizes that process which I

00:34:26,390 --> 00:34:31,040
think would be would be good for the

00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:34,669
world we have this really high quality

00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:37,960
UDF that just uh yeah that that sleep

00:34:34,669 --> 00:34:42,950
randant mmm that's some quality stuff

00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:44,899
this gets the language for a project so

00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:49,610
we get the committee's and then we get

00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:52,399
their languages I use this thing called

00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:56,330
known blocking DF saver load also known

00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:59,120
as my notebook keeps crashing and so I

00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:02,000
just wanted to save them it's terrible

00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:05,270
but it works aggregate a bunch of data

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:09,260
oh yeah I tried to scrape crunch base

00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:12,230
but yeah as this comment says robots.txt

00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:14,990
seems to be okay with it for now last

00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:16,670
checked April 4th since then I don't

00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:18,410
think they are anymore so it's commented

00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:19,930
out we don't actually run that

00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:22,490
extraction anymore I think they got

00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:25,360
frustrated but crunch please had a bunch

00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:25,360
of information about

00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,250
open-source contributors for some reason

00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:33,569
I don't know who put that information in

00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:36,819
there but thanks get their information

00:35:33,569 --> 00:35:39,640
do a bunch of stuff with it check that

00:35:36,819 --> 00:35:42,040
my sentiment analyzer correctly detects

00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:46,240
the difference in sentiment between

00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:50,799
these two sentences and then we extract

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:55,150
sentiment across all of the mailing list

00:35:50,799 --> 00:35:56,589
posts for a project yay and then there's

00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:58,809
a whole bunch of repartition encase a

00:35:56,589 --> 00:36:01,750
spark and life is terrible

00:35:58,809 --> 00:36:03,910
ignore the exceptions once again this is

00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:10,119
spark that exception actually means

00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:11,890
everything is going ok that's on my to

00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:13,900
fix list ok

00:36:11,890 --> 00:36:19,599
we do a bunch more do a bunch more

00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:22,270
 more more no well you know when I

00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:24,819
find something interesting again okay oh

00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:26,020
right we compute the sample sizes so

00:36:24,819 --> 00:36:31,030
that they're like actually statistically

00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:32,559
significant what's there oh yeah and

00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:33,940
then this is where I computed the sum of

00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:35,799
the sample size to make sure I could do

00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:38,980
it under budget and I kept changing the

00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:40,809
constraints until I got a input that

00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,130
resulted in a small enough sample size

00:36:40,809 --> 00:36:44,500
so that's how we ended up with the one

00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:47,170
year window and then we do a bunch of

00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:49,960
other stuff but I'm down to five minutes

00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:51,910
left so if you want you can read this

00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:56,500
notebook I actually have a question oh

00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:59,440
cool do you have tips to actively make

00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:02,190
your project or the meetups etc more

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:06,250
diverse that's a great question I don't

00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:08,890
I so I think working with groups like a

00:37:06,250 --> 00:37:11,410
Trichy can be really good if you're

00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:13,000
organizing like physical events making

00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:14,650
sure they're inaccessible locations

00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:18,549
maybe doing things that aren't just

00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:20,079
drinking after work because I feel hella

00:37:18,549 --> 00:37:23,710
uncomfortable getting drunk with a bunch

00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:25,210
of programmers that I don't know and I

00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:28,059
imagine there are other people who also

00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:30,579
have similar comfort challenges around

00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:32,980
that there's there are good resources

00:37:30,579 --> 00:37:35,319
about that this is all just correlations

00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:37,210
though and they don't I

00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:38,710
I was hoping if I stuck to correlations

00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:41,260
I wouldn't get yelled at

00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:42,940
so I I don't want to go too much to

00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:46,690
specific advice but you should talk to

00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:49,420
Gris who's seeing right behind you when

00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:50,650
the camera is not running or you can ask

00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:59,980
me again when the camera is not running

00:37:50,650 --> 00:38:01,540
look that works too I did you maybe I

00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:04,359
missed it but did you get a chance to

00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:05,650
like look at the diversity by country

00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:07,990
like the certain countries do better

00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:10,570
than other countries oh no I didn't

00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:13,660
that's a great next thing to do yes

00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:19,030
it'll be one group by away and pull

00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:20,589
requests welcome yeah

00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:22,300
I'm gonna go get lunch but after that

00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:29,260
I'll be back if you want them if you

00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:30,970
actually want to okay that's I think

00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:32,260
we're good yeah awesome thank you very

00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:32,730
much holding no thanks everyone for

00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:39,539
coming

00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:39,539
