Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2019: Aizhamal Nurmamat Kyzy & Riona MacNamara - From User to Contributor #bbuzz
Publication date: 2019-06-27
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2019 #bbuzz
Description: 
	Aizhamal Nurmamat Kyzy and Riona MacNamara talking about "From User to Contributor: How documentation enables vibrant open source communities".

Good engineering documentation not only drives adoption (48% of businesses say that documentation was the deciding factor in choosing to adopt an open source technology) and supports developers; it's also critical to supporting community contributors. Clear documentation of a project's processes, such as contributor guides and codes of conduct, are especially valued by under-represented groups and are vital to building inclusive communities. But in practice, 93% of OSS devs complain about the lack of good, reliable documentation, making it the #1 problem they face when working with open source software.

How can we fix this? In Q1 2019, Google's Open Source Strategy team commissioned a user research study to better understand why users do (or do not) contribute back to the project, and how documentation can help remove roadblocks to that project's adoption and usage - and encourage and enable community contributions.

In this talk, we'll cover the methodology and participant profiles of the study, and describe the three essential user personas we identified - along with their critical user journeys. And we'll also distill the research to provide concrete recommendations and best practices for creating documentation that helps your community flourish.

hello and welcome to our talk was Rena

00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:15,830
and I we're super excited and grateful

00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:18,080
to be speaking at bundling buzzwords and

00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:20,630
we've been enjoying this event so much

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,029
thank you for having us and yes today

00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:25,210
we're going to talk about documentation

00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:27,710
and its super power how it enables

00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:31,520
diverse inclusive open source

00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:36,280
communities so my name is eijah mal and

00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:40,160
I am a program manager and I work with

00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:42,680
open source projects related to Big Data

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:48,730
Apache BIM Apache airflow maybe heard of

00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:52,280
that and yeah and in this communities I

00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:55,129
advocate for more love and more

00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,140
attention for documentation and I

00:00:55,129 --> 00:01:01,699
advocate for recognition of non code

00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:04,159
contribution and and my name is Rianna

00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:06,409
McNamara I am a technical writer and a

00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,270
documentation advocate working on

00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:09,940
Google's open source strategy team and

00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,500
I've been working in tech in

00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:15,260
documentation for about a quarter of a

00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,820
century and there are two things after

00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,550
all that time that I remain really

00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,990
passionate about and one is

00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:22,610
documentation because documentation is

00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,070
not an afterthought and it is not a

00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:26,300
nice-to-have

00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,890
documentation I truly believe is as

00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,900
fundamental to the discipline of

00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,730
software engineering is testing it

00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,520
empowers and accelerates great

00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:36,020
development and in the time that I have

00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:40,130
been working in open source in the very

00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:42,380
short time I've begun to realize that it

00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:45,080
is also critical for diversion and

00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,880
inclusion in technology and an open

00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,430
source and diversion inclusion is the

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,780
other great passion of mine and since in

00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:53,080
the last year I've begun to see

00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:56,750
documentation and this cause is very

00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:59,510
very strongly related so these terms

00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:01,190
like diversity inclusion and equity we

00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:03,440
throw them around a lot and for a long

00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:05,450
time I tended to use them kind of

00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,220
interchangeably but this is a

00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,690
description I actually really like from

00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:11,599
Jess Mitchell where diversity is a

00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:13,340
number it simply represents the presence

00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,170
of difference there is a diversity of

00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,000
nationalities in this room there's a

00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,819
diversity of opinions about the ending

00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,459
of Game of Thrones

00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:23,760
that is just it is merely the starting

00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:26,069
point inclusion is much directing and

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,920
inclusion is where we actually bring

00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:30,689
people in an open source is used the

00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,840
world over and our communities are in

00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:35,870
fact pretty diverse of users it is used

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,180
everywhere but the community our

00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,859
community's inclusive the thing is the

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:42,659
software development of all kinds

00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:45,569
open-source proprietary it's a deeply

00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:47,519
complex endeavor and it's now widely and

00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:50,909
known and accepted the diverse inclusive

00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,129
teens we solve problems faster they make

00:02:50,909 --> 00:02:55,019
more creative solutions and diverse

00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:57,689
inclusive companies are more profitable

00:02:55,019 --> 00:03:01,019
and diverse inclusive communities are

00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:02,849
more effective but unfortunately as we

00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:04,859
all know the community the contributor

00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:08,280
base that we have for open source at the

00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:09,750
moment does not reflect the user base so

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,200
that's when we're looking at diversity

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:15,659
let's have a look at some numbers and

00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:18,000
here's let's look at one axis of

00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:19,590
diversity and I just want to make the

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,560
point that this is a short presentation

00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:25,290
and there isn't enough time to go into

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,669
all the different axes of diversity I'm

00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,560
going to talk here about gender

00:03:26,669 --> 00:03:31,109
imbalance and of course I am ignoring

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,569
all these other things around race

00:03:31,109 --> 00:03:35,970
social class the levels of ability

00:03:33,569 --> 00:03:38,790
orientation all the rest nevermind the

00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:40,049
intersections of these things but for

00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,769
now we're going to talk about gender

00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:45,810
balance and let's assume that in the

00:03:43,769 --> 00:03:48,780
general population people identifying as

00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:50,280
male and female are about equal while

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,560
also acknowledging that it doesn't add

00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,609
up to hundred percent right so that's

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,389
that's our general population let's now

00:03:56,609 --> 00:04:00,150
look at the world of professional

00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:01,949
programmers and it depends the figures

00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,260
vary depending on how you define a

00:04:01,949 --> 00:04:06,209
programmer right but this one figure it

00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,519
goes somewhere between twenty one twenty

00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:10,169
seven percent so the numbers the

00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:15,780
diversity is not looking so good there

00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:18,120
let's look at open source I'm going to

00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:22,049
help you out there that's three percent

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,820
in the github survey in 2017 of the

00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:25,409
respondents ninety-five percent were

00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,180
male three percent were women and one

00:04:25,409 --> 00:04:30,029
percent for non-binary and obviously

00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,480
this is representing a problem for open

00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:33,820
source because when our compete

00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:35,440
munities are not inclusive when women

00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,350
and underrepresented minorities feel

00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,090
uncomfortable and unwelcome everybody

00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:42,370
suffers our communities and projects

00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:44,680
miss out on the skills creativity and

00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,960
talent of a huge number of our users and

00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,870
it's bad for our projects it's bad for

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,670
our users and when we consider that we

00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:53,440
are now in a world where increasingly a

00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,960
track record of contributions to

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,850
open-source is seen as a prerequisite

00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,760
for getting a job in proprietary

00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:03,580
software this imbalance and open source

00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:07,720
has the potential to make the gender

00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:09,580
imbalance even worse at Google we wanted

00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,950
to understand more about this so we

00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:15,190
commissioned a study and we wanted to

00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:18,160
better understand how why and how people

00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:20,290
contribute or do not contribute to open

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,180
source projects and here I'm going to

00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:23,470
hand you off to a jamel who's going to

00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,960
tell you more about the study the

00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:30,730
process that we took and the findings of

00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:34,170
the study Thank You Reena so we started

00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:37,390
the process by talking to different

00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:40,360
people at Google that are involved with

00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:42,160
open source we talked to project

00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,470
maintainers who are also like software

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,130
engineers technical writers product

00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:51,310
managers program managers and we were

00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:55,360
looking to understand what kind of

00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:57,460
challenges they had trying to bring more

00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,370
users and contributors to their project

00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:02,710
and through these conversations we also

00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:05,230
wanted to set our expectations define

00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:07,390
our research goals and also talk about

00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:09,520
what would be the desired outcome from

00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:13,240
the research so we can benefit a lot of

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:17,080
open source projects and so the goal was

00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:22,690
to understand who are our users that are

00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:24,850
using our software and how do they go

00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:29,050
from being just the user to a community

00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:31,710
member in contributor and in their

00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:34,060
transition from user to contributor what

00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:37,420
information needs they have like what

00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:40,870
questions they ask and we were hoping to

00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:42,430
find answers to these questions and once

00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:44,440
we found we wanted to document

00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,060
everything and document the best

00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,590
practice

00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:50,639
so how to foster open source

00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:53,880
contributions and we interviewed 18

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,370
candidates from various backgrounds and

00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,950
all of them recent open source software

00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:03,240
users and we discussed their experience

00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:06,030
with evaluating open source technologies

00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,880
and we especially asked them about the

00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:10,500
feelings and experience around

00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:13,530
contributing to open source and if they

00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:16,350
weren't contributing we wanted to know

00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:19,440
why what are the barriers and once these

00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:21,870
interviews were completed we collected

00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,380
all the date all this data and we

00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:28,530
grouped them and we did the thematic

00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:32,010
analysis to uncover common patterns and

00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:37,169
themes and which eventually helped us

00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:42,620
craft the user archetypes and their

00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:45,900
journey Maps so in our study we actually

00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:48,570
identified five archetypes here you can

00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:52,860
see only four because and the other

00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:55,440
archetype is lurkers lurkers they don't

00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:57,120
interact with the project and we don't

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,610
know anything about them so we ignore

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,760
them for now and we focus on this fork

00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:09,210
or leader convinced competent and

00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:12,450
curious archetypes and yeah let's start

00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:17,310
with Rory Rory she's a leader in open

00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:20,430
source she she has like she is an active

00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:24,060
a member of open-source community she

00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:26,520
she collaborates with other leaders she

00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:29,100
provides a lot of mentorship she

00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:31,620
contributes code and documentation and

00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:37,770
she is very well supported by her

00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:39,750
employer and but she loves open-source

00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:42,630
and she wants more people to use open

00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:44,760
source and and she doesn't have enough

00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:47,310
time to convince other teams and

00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:49,230
business units of value of using and

00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:52,680
contributing factor open source and she

00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:56,990
needs tools to scale and maintain and

00:08:52,680 --> 00:09:00,710
grow her open source projects

00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:03,950
then there's Avery Avery she's she knows

00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:06,560
a fellow of contributing she can

00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:08,300
contribute dogs she can contribute code

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,900
and she is very familiar with the

00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:14,630
projects you could bring a lot of like a

00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:17,270
lot of value to the project but she's

00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:20,380
not doing it yet because her employer

00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:25,250
doesn't support her her employer is

00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:27,020
skeptical about open source he like he

00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:29,420
doesn't know afoul of contributing to

00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:32,620
open source and Avery she has to do it

00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:36,470
on her free time and it's not very easy

00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:41,450
yesterday in her speech in Isabel she

00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:43,310
she was talking about convincing your

00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:45,920
manager of value of contributing to open

00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:48,770
source and that's exactly what Avery

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,860
needs she needs help convincing her

00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:55,430
manager that open source is good to use

00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:58,700
and open sources and people needs to

00:09:55,430 --> 00:10:01,940
keep contributing to others and then

00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:05,060
there is Taylor Taylor he is software

00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:07,580
engineer and he's somewhat familiar with

00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:10,490
the project he sometimes engaged with

00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:12,790
the project and he contributes code

00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:15,140
mostly bug fixes and he thinks that

00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:17,870
contributing code is the only way of

00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:20,960
contribution to open source he has a lot

00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:23,900
of expertise and that he could bring to

00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:28,220
the project but he's not confident

00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:29,720
whether his time is spending in the

00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:32,780
right way whether it's worth his time

00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:36,140
whether his contributions are going to

00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:37,790
be recognized and rewarded and tailored

00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,680
needs to be solved on the value of

00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:41,690
contribution like he needs to be

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,320
convinced that he can become a valuable

00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:47,780
member of the community and by

00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:51,920
continuing to contribute not only code

00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:54,830
but documentation right so yesterday

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:57,290
grace and Isabel they also talked about

00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:59,930
how we need to recognize and reward

00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:02,090
people like Taylor to keep them

00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:04,960
motivated involved and keep them active

00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:10,819
in open-source and that's exactly what

00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:13,809
Taylor needs and finally meet Park

00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:17,149
her partner she's our heroine and she's

00:11:13,809 --> 00:11:18,889
she's very curious about open source and

00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:23,079
she would like to use one for her void

00:11:18,889 --> 00:11:26,119
Co work but she faces a lot of barriers

00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:28,970
first she's unfamiliar with open source

00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:32,929
in general she doesn't know what the

00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:37,309
process is what like licenses about and

00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:39,919
she doesn't know ethics and how people

00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:43,129
interact and she might not even be

00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:46,129
familiar with tools and platforms like

00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:47,929
github and and she doesn't know whether

00:11:46,129 --> 00:11:51,350
her employer will be happy if she starts

00:11:47,929 --> 00:11:53,839
using it right and Parker loves the idea

00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:56,089
of open source however and she would

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:59,359
love to contribute back someday but

00:11:56,089 --> 00:12:02,539
she's because she's not engineering she

00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:06,949
doesn't know whether she can bring

00:12:02,539 --> 00:12:09,529
anything valuable to the project so she

00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:12,649
might be also nervous because she might

00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:15,379
not speak English as a first language so

00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:19,489
she might not be able to understand very

00:12:15,379 --> 00:12:23,269
like advanced documentation and and she

00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:27,289
might even experience like harassment in

00:12:23,269 --> 00:12:32,299
the web so it's very like scary to get

00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:34,669
involved and Parker she needs all the

00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:37,279
support that you can give her so she can

00:12:34,669 --> 00:12:39,829
get started like in you need to show her

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,889
like how it's done like how to file your

00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:44,449
first PR how to like just set the

00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:47,839
expectation okay it takes like a couple

00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:49,819
days to get your what is it PR say prove

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:53,329
it or a couple months or whatever right

00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:57,799
and I assume that many people in the

00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:59,539
room you like might be like Rory like

00:12:57,799 --> 00:13:01,959
leader in open source or a very

00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:05,359
experienced contributor like Avery but I

00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:11,119
really want to talk about Parker today

00:13:05,359 --> 00:13:13,399
because she's where we start in the

00:13:11,119 --> 00:13:15,499
beginning like I was Parker like a

00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:18,579
couple months ago right and when I just

00:13:15,499 --> 00:13:22,020
started contributing and I want us to

00:13:18,579 --> 00:13:25,440
see how she becomes

00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:27,330
user of open source and how she grows

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,980
into contributor in the open source or

00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:30,529
maybe she doesn't grow into contributor

00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:35,310
let's find out

00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:39,080
so how does Parker pick a project how

00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:41,790
she becomes a user right there are many

00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:44,490
available options libraries and how does

00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:47,670
she choose the right one she starts by

00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:50,760
looking into available options and once

00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:53,370
she finds one software the project that

00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:56,730
looks promising she does a quick

00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:59,490
assessment for free will it will it work

00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:02,060
with my team with my environment like

00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:04,920
will I be able to understand this and

00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:09,660
she wants to be able to sift out the

00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:12,540
project projects that she can't work

00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:15,000
with like quickly like she doesn't want

00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:19,260
to spend like one man studying project

00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,800
and not be able to use that then and if

00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:24,390
the project passes her sniff test she

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,480
needs to understand if the project is

00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:30,870
healthy and well maintained so she does

00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:34,850
it by looking at statistic and github by

00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:38,520
how many stars downloads how often the

00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:44,579
releases are how like how recent the

00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:47,149
commits are and she also like overviews

00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:49,740
documentation at this date quickly

00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:53,850
because she wants to make sure that they

00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:58,529
exist so she can rely on them later and

00:14:53,850 --> 00:15:01,649
only once she is sure that the project

00:14:58,529 --> 00:15:04,190
is healthy and active only after that

00:15:01,649 --> 00:15:07,230
she starts building into code itself and

00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:11,250
she needs to be able to create a map of

00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:14,850
the technology and understand whether

00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:19,079
it's a good fit for her use case and she

00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:21,570
also wants to she wants help getting up

00:15:19,079 --> 00:15:25,350
and running very quickly by doing the

00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:28,170
Quick Start and tutorials and all of the

00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:31,110
people that we spoke to they mentioned

00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:34,870
that documentation was so critical at

00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:36,880
this face and well maintained and

00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:40,120
structured accessible available

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:45,760
documentation was a strong signal that

00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:48,430
the project is healthy and of course

00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:51,640
before adopting any open source

00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:54,160
technology people like Parker she wants

00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:57,070
to make sure that there will be no like

00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:00,339
legal complications like of using free

00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:04,060
software right she wants to know whether

00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:08,589
there's any documentation available that

00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:10,930
explains like legal policies and whether

00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:13,390
she can pass them on to her legal team

00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:15,610
for assessment and Isabelle also

00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:17,470
mentioned that like everyone before

00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:19,630
adopting a new technology they asked

00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:21,520
these questions and it's very important

00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:26,380
and you need to make sure that you have

00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:28,540
it so one spark is able to answer all of

00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:32,160
those questions she's ready to adopt the

00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:34,720
technology she starts using it and she's

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,750
excited about technology because it's

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:42,520
free it's fun it helps her to her word

00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:46,060
and as she keeps using software as it

00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:53,080
always happens she eventually runs into

00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:55,300
a bug or some problem right and and she

00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,660
starts digging into documentation and

00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:03,059
she starts reaching out people in social

00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:07,720
channels to to find the solution and

00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:10,689
after hard work a lot of hours spent on

00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:14,110
the research she she finally finds a

00:17:10,689 --> 00:17:16,660
solution and she is excited about it she

00:17:14,110 --> 00:17:20,920
she knows she has an idea and she knows

00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:23,980
how to fix it right and at this stage

00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:28,059
Parker is adapting the project making it

00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:32,380
better because she is like making a fix

00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:34,240
for the bug right and and she's happy

00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:36,820
about it because she knows her fix is

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,500
good and it would benefit everyone in

00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:41,320
the community it would save a lot of

00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:44,050
trouble and time for many others that

00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:46,570
will use the same software and she

00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:48,130
really wants to contribute back but she

00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:51,490
has never created any

00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:55,000
you are or submitted to fix so it's a

00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:57,130
big career for her and let's imagine

00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,020
even like she comes and she wants to

00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:02,560
contribute back she talks to her boss

00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:04,060
and her boss is not supportive and she

00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,950
says like oh we don't pay you for your

00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:09,610
open source contributions don't spend

00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:11,890
time on it and it's and it's very hard

00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:14,230
and like she started thinking about all

00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:18,430
of this and she starts thinking about

00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:22,120
like whether her fix is good enough

00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:24,370
whether it's valuable whether people are

00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,350
going to call Parker that she's not good

00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:29,590
enough that she's asking stupid

00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:32,800
questions so so it's very daunting it's

00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:37,330
very scary and at this stage it becomes

00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:42,760
very easy for Parker not to share rather

00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:44,680
than share her fix and because the act

00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,560
of contribution contributing to open

00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:49,530
source itself is very vulnerable and

00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:53,530
exposes you in front of all these people

00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:55,600
right and she doesn't have bandwidth to

00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:58,480
deal with all of this and it's a lot of

00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,460
pressure and it's stressful and then

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,340
let's imagine she decides not to

00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:05,080
contribute back and it's really really

00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:09,940
sad story because it happens all the

00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:13,270
time and if she if Parker decides not to

00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:16,750
contribute that we all lose right Parker

00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:19,600
loses the opportunity to become like

00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:21,910
valuable member of the community the

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,730
project loses because it would benefit

00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:27,490
greatly from her fix and also her

00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:30,790
employer loses because they don't have

00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:32,860
this proof that they can show to their

00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:35,590
customers and LaHaye we are very active

00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:39,880
in open source communities as Isabel was

00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:43,360
mentioning yesterday so how can we help

00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:46,930
Parker like how we can ensure that she

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:50,950
doesn't feel this way and actually makes

00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:52,960
her way to her first contribution and do

00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:56,950
you have an ideas Reena I have some

00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:59,890
ideas okay thank you as you might well

00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:01,660
let's rewind this a little bit so how

00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:03,880
might the story have turned out better

00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:06,190
what if Parker had been able to access

00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,630
the information she needed to every step

00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:09,730
of her journey because let's remember

00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:12,520
the Parker is brand-new to open source

00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:14,130
she's not an engineer she doesn't have a

00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,390
lot of support internally or externally

00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:19,510
maybe English isn't her first language

00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:21,340
and she may not be uncomfortable in

00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,170
online communities these are all

00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:25,360
challenges that she faces but let's also

00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:28,690
acknowledge that she is smart as a whip

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:31,090
she has a ton to contribute and she has

00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:34,330
unique perspectives that are a value of

00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:36,430
that so how might that turn out what

00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:38,770
might be get if she actually felt

00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:41,680
supported at every stage of the journey

00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:43,900
is that the case it's actually not

00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,400
really the case today far too much so in

00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:48,400
the next few slides I want to talk a

00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:50,050
little bit about why documentation is so

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,760
critical in this journey what

00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:53,950
documentation you need is every stage of

00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:57,040
the journey and touch a little bit about

00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:59,890
how you can get that documentation this

00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,960
is a really sad story according to the

00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:04,090
open source survey incomplete or

00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:07,120
outdated information is a pervasive

00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:08,650
problem observed by 93% of the

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,680
population and this is horrifying

00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:13,540
because open source any kind of software

00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,910
is such a deeply complex and highly

00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:18,640
collaborative endeavor documentation is

00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:20,470
a critical part of it yet even now it's

00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,500
super common to hear people say the

00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:25,690
documentation is not that necessary it's

00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,880
still 25 years later I hear engineers

00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:29,260
say things like just read the code you

00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,570
don't need documentation this is

00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,990
actually a real-life query that I saw in

00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:33,610
kora

00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:36,550
I redacted the name because I'm a good

00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:38,380
person but they it's it's along with the

00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:40,120
same query some other answers were read

00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:42,430
the code commit by commit then you can

00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:44,650
learn to understand it you know who has

00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:46,720
the time for that and north alot of

00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:50,230
people specifically do not have the time

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:53,370
for that this is one example the UN

00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:57,400
study shows that women the world over do

00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:59,830
2.6 2.6 times the amount of unpaid labor

00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:02,890
that men do women do that represents

00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:05,680
hours and hours of day of unpaid work

00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:07,390
the men on average and that means that

00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:09,970
we need to acknowledge the free time to

00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:12,940
open contribute and use open sources of

00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:15,490
privilege people like Parker many people

00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:17,770
just do not have the time to go and

00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:19,840
read the code commit by commit we need

00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:21,610
documentation that explains the project

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,350
and the code and clearly outlines the

00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:26,020
processes of the community so people

00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:28,330
without this leisure time and employer

00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:30,250
support to investigate lack of

00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:34,150
documentation is an incredibly effective

00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:36,040
barrier to current contribution another

00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:37,840
one is that we may think of ourselves as

00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,940
a friendly community but the truth is

00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,679
that not everybody experiences the

00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:44,320
Internet in the same way and not

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,270
everybody feels safe reaching out for

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,730
example women are far more likely to

00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:50,770
encounter language or content that makes

00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:52,600
them feel unwelcome as well as

00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:56,020
stereotypical behavior and even

00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:58,230
harassment on the web and unsurprisingly

00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:00,850
then women and underrepresented

00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:02,590
minorities are far less likely to reach

00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:05,470
out to strangers and ask for help in

00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:08,380
forums or in other things so in this

00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:10,059
circumstance lack of documentation is an

00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:13,030
incredibly effective barrier to

00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:15,040
contribution here's another one nearly

00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:17,340
1/4 of the open-source community speaks

00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:19,929
and reads English less than very well

00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:21,550
again this adds complexity to how you

00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:22,929
find information and makes you less

00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:25,330
confident when you're reaching out to

00:23:22,929 --> 00:23:27,100
people when people in this case when

00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:29,080
English is the de facto language of

00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:31,510
software development and we don't have

00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:33,520
clear easily readable documentation

00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:36,550
that's enough an effective barrier to

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,350
contribution and in other areas that not

00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:39,970
everybody comes into open source the

00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:41,980
same level of expertise at the same

00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:43,960
level of background is something for

00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:46,690
Parker we see as a data analyst not an

00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:48,790
engineer if we don't have documentation

00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:51,010
that accommodates for every level of

00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:53,170
expertise and provides an on-ramp for

00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:55,600
everybody who might use our software

00:23:53,170 --> 00:24:00,910
that is an incredibly effective barrier

00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:04,050
to participation and contribution the

00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:06,610
fact is as I de Mille said

00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:09,309
contributing an even using open-source

00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:11,950
software requires ourselves to be

00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:14,950
incredibly vulnerable and open ourselves

00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:17,260
up to criticism from not even like in

00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:19,059
the workplace where we know people and

00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:21,610
they are paid to help us perform an

00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:24,160
anonymous people the world over it is an

00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:26,500
incredibly terrifying thing and this was

00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,809
echoed by everybody in our study not

00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,590
even not just the Parkers and the

00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:31,179
beginners

00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:33,400
everybody even experienced people

00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:35,260
experience the self-doubt when they were

00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,820
putting out their PRS the refer they

00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:38,380
were afraid to ask questions and they

00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,820
were afraid because they might sound

00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:42,220
stupid and they were afraid to answer

00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:49,390
questions because they might their

00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:50,950
answers might get torn apart so how can

00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:52,809
we then let's talk about the

00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:54,130
documentation how can we empower people

00:24:52,809 --> 00:24:56,740
to take this leap because it's

00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:58,659
incredibly rewarding what is the

00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:01,480
information that we can provide clear

00:24:58,659 --> 00:25:04,419
accessible information available to all

00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:06,970
that describes the project it's cold the

00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:08,740
open source world and the processes and

00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:10,570
norms of our communities so what I want

00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:12,640
to do is just look at Parker's journey

00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:14,350
and just talk about the specific

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,169
documentation needs that she has at

00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:19,750
every stage so when she's investigating

00:25:17,169 --> 00:25:21,580
a project she needs to know straight

00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:23,350
upfront things that will allow her to

00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:25,870
eliminate a project because it's not a

00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:28,120
fit for her team make sure that really

00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:30,010
up front on your documentation you have

00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,080
very discoverable things that outlines

00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:34,600
the basics platform languages other

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,970
compatibility but also things like use

00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:39,190
cases these are really important things

00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:41,289
not only for Parker will dissolve her

00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:43,570
problem but it allows her to take it to

00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:44,919
her manager and her boss and say this is

00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:47,679
something our business should be

00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:49,539
investing in they also want to know can

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,090
they get started quickly how hard is it

00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:54,100
going to be to ramp up clear getting

00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:57,010
started guides and tutorials are going

00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:59,020
to be really important here and at this

00:25:57,010 --> 00:26:00,789
stage they're going to be looking at the

00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:02,590
documentation itself this QuickStart

00:26:00,789 --> 00:26:05,590
information but they're also really

00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:07,299
going to be looking at the presence even

00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:09,250
if they don't dig into the documentation

00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:10,929
the presence of it is such a strong

00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:14,710
proxy that this is going to be well

00:26:10,929 --> 00:26:16,809
supported on your journey and Isabel and

00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:19,240
touched on this very strongly and

00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:21,429
actually talked about this about people

00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:24,250
you can share their use cases because if

00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:26,620
you're not supported you need I think

00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:29,559
it's like the majority of people in the

00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:32,380
github survey said that they their work

00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:34,029
employers had very unclear policies and

00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:36,250
understandings around using and

00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:37,960
contributing to open source so the more

00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:40,360
resources that can provide especially

00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:43,030
use cases and then documentation about

00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,420
the requirement and then she also needs

00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:45,340
to

00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:47,140
learn about getting started with github

00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:48,700
you don't need to document get up but

00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:51,220
you need to make sure that there are

00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:53,470
clear pointers to that and make sure

00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:56,980
that her baby steps are well documented

00:26:53,470 --> 00:27:00,630
so this is an example of the kind of

00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:00,630
things they look at people specific

00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:05,080
documentation sets that our respondents

00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:07,120
identified as being particularly helpful

00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:09,850
to them and that were decision-making

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,010
and they explicitly call that navigation

00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:14,890
like this is a really strong quality for

00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:17,560
it so when she gets into it this is

00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:19,240
where the standard typical engineering

00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:22,530
documentation comes in this is where

00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:25,650
things like api references overviews

00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:28,150
how-to guides tutorials troubleshooting

00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:30,070
standard core engineering documentation

00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:32,500
becomes very important but it's very

00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:35,290
important that this exists but it also

00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:36,820
supports all levels of expertise we kind

00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:39,580
of presuppose too much knowledge around

00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:41,890
that and we also need to make sure that

00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:44,530
they know where to find other sources of

00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:45,850
help people are less happy even asking

00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:47,320
questions but there are little happier

00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:50,940
reading answers to other people's

00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:53,740
questions and again at this stage

00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:57,550
navigation and organization is very

00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:59,260
important and at this stage when she's

00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:02,560
digging in it becomes really critical

00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:04,510
that your docs set is searchable because

00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:06,400
at this stage in the early stage they're

00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:07,720
looking to make a decision but when

00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:10,240
they're implementing they need to go

00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,980
back and find information over and over

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,690
again they know what they're looking for

00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:16,750
now and they need to be able to find us

00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:23,020
so search becomes really important in

00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:24,910
this stage so once she has this and she

00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:28,000
is using it and she gets this trigger

00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:30,130
she makes the fix it's very very

00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,260
important the most important factor is

00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:35,410
psychological safety we need a friendly

00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:37,330
and well moderated community and we can

00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:39,280
help by this by providing written

00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:41,290
guidelines accessible both to the

00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:44,940
maintainer --zz and the community but

00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:48,760
also to new people that describe how

00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:50,290
best to moderate and review PRS had to

00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:52,570
do it in a way that is safe and

00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:55,120
welcoming and that is really important

00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:57,020
especially remembering that Parker may

00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:01,100
not have had positive experiences on

00:28:57,020 --> 00:29:04,100
Internet in the past another area is

00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:06,500
that Parker may experiences a lot of

00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:08,870
self-doubt she's not sure how she can

00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,910
contribute it's a clear welcoming

00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:12,830
documentation that really makes her feel

00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:14,750
welcome acknowledges that she brings

00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:16,820
perspectives and provides a lot of

00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:19,190
options to contribute you may not be an

00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:21,140
engineer but as we say there's a lot of

00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,730
Chris's talk yesterday talked about this

00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:25,640
a lot this user management there's

00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:27,770
documentation obviously but there's also

00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:29,810
organizing meetups program management

00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:32,270
triage all sorts of ways that people can

00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:34,130
effectively do it and one thing that's

00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:38,290
worth bearing in mind here is that a lot

00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:41,540
of women and underrepresented minorities

00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:44,030
may not feel comfortable putting

00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:45,920
themselves forward if you notice a new

00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:48,140
user in the community and they're doing

00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,950
their logging issues they found an issue

00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:51,440
with the docks

00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:53,990
it's worth considering reaching out to

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,760
them and suggesting and saying you made

00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:57,620
a really good point here and you bring

00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,480
this fresh perspective you're in a

00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:01,490
position to identify gaps in the

00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,660
documentation which are seasoned users

00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:06,560
are not we would welcome please

00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:09,830
acknowledge and contribute to your

00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:11,870
documentation and once people do that

00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:14,600
it's really really important that we

00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:16,760
recognize and celebrate non-code

00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,740
contributions obviously including but

00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,930
not limited but obviously including

00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:23,390
documentation and there's so many ways

00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:25,490
of doing that and one thing is like put

00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:27,500
documentation updates in your release

00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:30,800
notes just like you put feature and code

00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:33,500
updates go and give public tanks that

00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:36,350
acknowledges people in the mailing lists

00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:38,270
this is a good thing to do and an

00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:41,390
encouraging thing to do but it can also

00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:43,190
help people overcome barriers with their

00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:44,810
employers because they can take this and

00:30:43,190 --> 00:30:47,750
demonstrate the value of what they are

00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:49,490
bringing to the community there's a lot

00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:52,160
of other ways and there's I just

00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:54,290
discovered this get a project recognize

00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,750
all contributors which is an awesome way

00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:58,730
of putting people's faces it pulls the

00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:00,320
names and things and puts it right into

00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:02,660
your documentation where everybody can

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,820
see it and it also supports things like

00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:07,850
non code contributions and I'll tweet

00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:10,000
out the link to that later on

00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:13,880
so when Parker contributes to this

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,590
everybody wins she gets to grow and to

00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,440
feel good and to be part of a community

00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:20,660
obviously the project's users all get

00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,760
the benefits of her fix the community is

00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:25,100
stronger and even her employer benefits

00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:26,840
it's more efficient if her fixes

00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,370
integrated upstream then when you

00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:31,010
upgrade there's one less thing to worry

00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:33,410
about and it's also something like a PR

00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:36,170
thing that her employer can do so it's

00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:39,410
really important so let's recap some of

00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:41,660
the key messages that we have here lack

00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:45,200
of documentation is a highly effective

00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:48,200
barrier to adoption and contribution and

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,330
in a world where communities are vital

00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,940
to project health code quality and

00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:55,570
adoption we need this kind of

00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:58,010
documentation it slack is particularly

00:31:55,570 --> 00:32:01,520
harmful to underrepresented groups

00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:03,650
including people who have limited time

00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,870
speak English who the lower level of

00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:08,450
expertise or feels unsafe and online

00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:09,170
communities psychological safety is

00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:10,910
paramount

00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:13,340
open-source requires us to be vulnerable

00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:15,380
we can make people feel safe and

00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:17,180
welcomed in the community with good

00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:19,490
documentation a friendly and well

00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:21,170
moderated community and active

00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:25,520
contributions that provide a model for

00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:27,170
new contributors the kind to build

00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:29,200
psychological safety and empower

00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:31,850
contributions we need to provide

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,700
documentation that clearly describes the

00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:37,450
project its code and the community and

00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:41,450
this is what's Bill's safety and

00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:43,930
confidence just as in the Apache Way

00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:46,430
decision making is made in the open

00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:48,710
documentation is how we get tribal

00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:50,750
knowledge out of the heads of people and

00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:56,180
put it in the hands of where it is

00:32:50,750 --> 00:33:02,960
accessible to everybody doc sir didn't

00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:04,990
happen it doesn't exist and we need to

00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,480
seek out support and recognize

00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:10,790
documentation contributions we need to

00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,560
make it as easy as possible to be

00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:14,960
contribute we need to reach out to

00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,880
people provide clear lines and we need

00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,860
to be responsive and kind it sounds like

00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,370
table stakes than everybody in this room

00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:25,160
I'm just

00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:29,480
and that so at the beginning of this

00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:31,370
talk we talked about diversity inclusion

00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:34,630
and we haven't yet really touched on

00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:37,550
equity the open source world is already

00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:41,420
diverse it has used the world over by

00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:43,490
all sorts of Engineers when we create

00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:45,830
documentation that enables everybody to

00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:49,250
contribute to our project we make those

00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:51,260
communities more inclusive but

00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:55,070
documentation has the power to do an

00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:56,870
awful lot more we talk about this world

00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:59,210
now where a track record of open-source

00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:01,340
contribution can be a pathway to

00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:03,830
employment and that means that is a

00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:06,140
pathway to economic advancement think

00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:08,210
about people some people have gone to

00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:09,530
universities gotten CS degrees some

00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:11,419
people are going through the bootcamp

00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:15,790
route they're doing this as their chance

00:34:11,419 --> 00:34:17,899
for a new role and to enter this field

00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:22,820
documentation could be a really powerful

00:34:17,899 --> 00:34:24,620
tool for equity and inclusion tribal

00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:26,240
knowledge concentrates power in the

00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:28,010
hands of the privileged view its

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,870
inefficient which is why we do

00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:32,750
everything on the list but it's also

00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:35,240
harmful and we know this at a really

00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:37,580
intuitive level all of us grew up with

00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,740
fairy stories were one of the myths is

00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:42,230
the young hero or heroine who needs to

00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:44,510
find the book of knowledge because the

00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:47,060
universal access to knowledge threatens

00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:49,580
the dominant order and there is a reason

00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:51,790
for example that age was a crime to

00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:54,409
teach enslaved people to read and

00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:57,260
everyone here in this room and I feel

00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:59,120
this very strongly about myself we all

00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:01,130
just by being in this room are

00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,810
experiencing a really strong level of

00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:05,660
privilege right we all have different

00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:09,320
levels of privilege right but to be here

00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:10,850
at this conference for those of us who

00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,860
were not German we were all able to get

00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:15,110
a visa and enter this country we all

00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:17,840
understand English enough to have these

00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:19,880
conversations and do this our employers

00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,710
probably paid for us to be here but in

00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:24,200
any way we're economically able to be

00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:27,020
here for people with kids we have

00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:29,270
somebody to watch those kids and just by

00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:30,740
being here everyone here and I miss my

00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:33,050
first buzz words and I'm feeling this

00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:34,700
really strongly we are building networks

00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:36,680
and connections we're building social

00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:39,650
capital that will grow our careers and

00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:41,120
our economic status and after this

00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:43,310
comfort conference we're going to feel

00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:45,260
so much more comfortable reaching out to

00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:46,910
people that we met here today and

00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:48,890
there's nothing wrong with having that

00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:50,690
privilege but in a world for our

00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:53,660
participation and open source can be a

00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:55,880
path to economic advancement to promote

00:35:53,660 --> 00:36:01,070
not just diversity and inclusion but

00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:02,900
also equity we can use that privilege if

00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:05,120
we ensure that we document our community

00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:07,310
norms and practices and our projects

00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:09,260
encodes the knowledge needed to navigate

00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:12,470
our communities is available to

00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:13,700
everybody we promote equity if we do

00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:15,290
what we can to make sure that that

00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:17,930
knowledge is accessible to everyone

00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:19,310
regardless of language or ability or

00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:21,500
social capital

00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:23,090
we promote equity and if we give people

00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:25,130
the knowledge they need to participate

00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:27,410
in this amazing industry to take

00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:30,740
advantage of the economic advancement it

00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:32,480
offers we promote equity and if we seek

00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:35,570
out contributions from underrepresented

00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:41,170
groups and give them opportunities we

00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:43,600
promote equity knowledge is power and

00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:46,670
documentation is how we make that power

00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:48,080
available to everyone thank you very

00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:50,120
much for having us here it has been a

00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:56,030
privilege thank you

00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:59,130
[Applause]

00:36:56,030 --> 00:37:00,839
all right so we saw from this talk and

00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:02,520
from the keynotes as well that there are

00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:06,390
a lot of ways to contribute to open

00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:08,880
source project other than donating and

00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:13,589
contributing source code that's good to

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:19,040
to know and I think we have time for one

00:37:13,589 --> 00:37:19,040
question yes I will pass around the mic

00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:28,589
thank you great talk you mentioned

00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:30,630
briefly something that I think is an

00:37:28,589 --> 00:37:33,150
incredible asset that a new contributor

00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:35,280
has to a project and I wish it had a

00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:38,730
name because I think all of us seasoned

00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,349
people that have API blindness we

00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:43,049
totally don't understand the perspective

00:37:40,349 --> 00:37:44,790
of a new contributor I've heard it

00:37:43,049 --> 00:37:49,140
called a very unique tool that is very

00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:51,299
sharp but quickly dulls I think if we

00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:53,010
could identify that and name this

00:37:51,299 --> 00:37:55,049
amazing quality that new contributors

00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:56,730
bring to a project that would be an

00:37:55,049 --> 00:37:58,470
amazing draw because these people bring

00:37:56,730 --> 00:38:02,430
something incredibly special that we all

00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:06,839
have lost I agree like if what I think

00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:11,760
you're describing is an obliviousness

00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:13,950
two blind spots we have blind spots new

00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,500
people do not and that's incredibly

00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:20,069
special yeah so we should be seeking out

00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,450
these people that have spots exactly

00:38:20,069 --> 00:38:24,390
especially when you think about things

00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:25,920
like we take certain skill levels for

00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:29,910
granted right so we don't document

00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,859
things for beginners yes I would love to

00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:33,780
have a conversation about how to what we

00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:35,490
should call that and have a name for it

00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:37,500
we've heard a name and I lost the name

00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:38,940
and I have my own tremendous API

00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:41,099
blindness but if we could give it a name

00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:42,809
that would spread I think that would

00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:45,780
just be an incredible draw to help us

00:38:42,809 --> 00:38:49,530
grow our communities and I don't have

00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:51,089
the name yet - is there a task that

00:38:49,530 --> 00:38:53,010
that's just a good conversation over

00:38:51,089 --> 00:38:57,119
coffee it's it's what a newcomer has

00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:58,829
that's the opposite of API blindness API

00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,569
blindness is when you're so familiar

00:38:58,829 --> 00:39:01,740
with your source code and your processes

00:39:00,569 --> 00:39:04,260
and github that you don't even

00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:05,880
understand what a new person feels when

00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,030
they try to join your project all of the

00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,260
barriers that they hit

00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:09,730
because you don't see those barriers

00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:12,670
anymore you're so comfortable with your

00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:15,700
community in your processes so newcomer

00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:17,050
because they with that they can tell you

00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,310
what are the barriers to the other

00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:21,220
newcomers that are trying to join your

00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:22,660
project and if we fix those the process

00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:26,650
just accelerates it becomes an awesome

00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:30,840
flywheel so we need a name for it that

00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:30,840
we all can agree on and yeah

00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:48,330
so I was suggesting that we refer to

00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:50,550
that as user empathy especially new user

00:39:48,330 --> 00:39:53,070
empathy trying to understand precisely

00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:56,340
those two sticky points and we're a bit

00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:59,280
late folks get kind of I hold and then

00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:01,710
dropped from the funnel so how do we

00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:07,340
prevent that attrition from the journey

00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:07,340
we can start the thread and suggest I

00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:13,080
think that's a very interesting

00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:15,180
conversation but let's stick to the

00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:19,100
schedule maybe you can take this

00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:19,100
discussion offline with the speakers and

00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:24,020
so let's thank the speakers again thank

00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:27,300
you very much Rina Angela

00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:27,300
