Description: 
	"We have won" - that's what I once heard about the trust that is being put into free and open source projects. Looking back at ten years of Berlin Buzzwords, it's hard to imagine how things could be any different: Projects developed at the Apache Software Foundation are basis on which tons of data analytics systems are built. 

But as a downstream user likely betting their core business on open source - how well do you understand how these projects are being governed, how direction is being set, how well they are equipped to survive the next decade? After all, there's more to open source than the source code itself.

The ASF provides a home to several hundred OSS projects - a lot of them relevant to the search, store, scale, stream ecosystem that Berlin Buzzwords targets. If you have been digging a bit deeper, you may have encountered the phrase “The Apache Way” - often used in relation to how projects at the ASF should work.

This talk tries to give a glimpse behind the scenes - with a strong focus on what the implications of best practices advertised at the ASF are for downstream users of it’s projects.
