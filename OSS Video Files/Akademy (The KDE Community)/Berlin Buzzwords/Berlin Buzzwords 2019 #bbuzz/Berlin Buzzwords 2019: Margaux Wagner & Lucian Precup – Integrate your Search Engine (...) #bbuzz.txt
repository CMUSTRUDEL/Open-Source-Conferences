Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2019: Margaux Wagner & Lucian Precup – Integrate your Search Engine (...) #bbuzz

Description: 
	Margaux Wagner and Lucian Precup talking about "Integrate your Search Engine with a Voice Assistant".

The User Experience on a mobile phone is different of that of a tablet and still different of that of a computer screen. You have to adapt your graphical interface, the information displayed but also the calls to your services.

When the “User Interface” is a “voice”, the User Experience and the services your application provides need to adjust.

In this presentation we will adapt, step by step, an Enterprise Search Engine to Google Assistant and, more generally, to a Virtual Voice Assistant. The challenge will be to find the one and only meaningful result with a minimum of round trips while taking into account all the constraints of this type of User Interaction (among which also: "being funny with the answers").

00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:27,899
Bousema that helped a lot with the demo

00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:29,310
van song alexei so yeah here we go so

00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:32,280
let's back first before she goes to

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,859
search to voice search by first - what

00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,990
we know already so here is a let's call

00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:38,460
a classical search engine ok so here is

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,070
on a large screen what we call large

00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,329
screen is on a laptop for example so

00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,700
here you can see you have a lot of

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:47,070
information display so I was can see you

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,619
have all your baskets and all your

00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,060
profile for example here also of course

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:52,950
you have all the result so you can see

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,500
you have like 4 or 5 result that you can

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,509
display here we see like we can have

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,450
like a marketing shortcuts like to push

00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:04,380
some content and here on the left we can

00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:06,570
see we have facets in order to narrow

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,490
the the results in order to help the

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:10,470
customer to go directly to what you

00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:12,450
really wants to so the screen displays

00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,159
only to fast is there but you notice

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:17,360
that there is a scrollbar so you have

00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:20,480
plenty of space there actually like

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,020
six or seven fastest there and ten or

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,790
twelve results on the first page so

00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:28,040
here's another example so here you have

00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:30,440
the what we call auto completion so you

00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:32,210
just have to type like three of two or

00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,680
three letters and the search and I will

00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:37,340
give you some suggestions products

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,500
objection so you notice that the input

00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,020
is not verbose you just typed three

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,760
letters and the engine answered yeah the

00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,130
goal here is really to show you all the

00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:50,209
information that we can provide you to

00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:52,550
the users here's another example again

00:02:50,209 --> 00:02:54,680
does nobody knows how to write that what

00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:58,550
it so they're search and I will give you

00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,890
like you suggest you another product in

00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:03,110
ordered once again to help the customer

00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:05,420
the user to find the product he wants so

00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,950
the goal is really to show like all the

00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:10,010
information that we can display on a

00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:12,410
classical search engine the reason I

00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:15,080
have to who speaks German and who speaks

00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:17,570
French is because as you notice we have

00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,900
some examples here that are taken from

00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:23,840
some search engines that we build and

00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:27,950
they are mostly in French but I think

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,500
you can follow so here's another example

00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:33,410
this is internal search uncheck that we

00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:35,180
develop at editing and you can also have

00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,890
all the suggestions like did you mean so

00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,140
for example when you do their customer

00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:41,720
didn't write like did a misspelled in in

00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:43,640
the search for the sorting here in this

00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,620
example you can even display the result

00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:48,340
by map because for these clients like

00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:51,380
you wanted to have all the document

00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:53,060
regarding the the different country here

00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,440
you have the imagination with all the

00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:57,500
page like it can have a lot of results

00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:59,030
and here the same like oh the facet like

00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,190
you can see we can have a lot of facets

00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:03,650
once again to help the customer and the

00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:04,459
users to get to the to the product to to

00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,170
what he's looking for

00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:09,769
so as you can notice there's plenty of

00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:11,660
space so you can as yeah in just one

00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:14,239
call to the search engine you can

00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:16,430
display plenty of things it's not like a

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,530
narrow plane dashboard but there's

00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,630
plenty of space now let's move on and

00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:24,020
see how what happens when we are

00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:26,870
reducing the string the screen size so

00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:28,430
now is on a mobile device so as you can

00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,900
see we still have a lot of information

00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,720
but search engine had to

00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:34,550
tapped and try to display the result in

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,449
another way for example here we don't

00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:41,090
have the the facet display by default so

00:04:38,449 --> 00:04:43,910
the user has to click on it you see all

00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:46,039
of them and you see like many men the

00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:48,500
main facet like they will hide a little

00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:53,120
bit of your of your screen so this is

00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:56,330
another way to display information but

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,300
still we have placed four facets even if

00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:01,340
not on the first screen so same here

00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,660
like we took exactly the same example

00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,449
that before on the laptop but on a

00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,740
mobile device and you can see you still

00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:09,590
have the information but display in

00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,660
another way so the search engine started

00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:15,370
to adapt a little bit but you know it's

00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:19,070
use your small adaptation

00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:23,270
okay the last example with the same with

00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:24,770
the same search on time than before so

00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,750
now we can have like only one result

00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:29,060
before we have like three or four the

00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:35,720
same for the facet and the filter and

00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:38,090
yeah all the information again okay so

00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,070
now let's move on to the real subject so

00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:42,110
the issues and challenge with the voice

00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,460
search so first of all like we saw we

00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,260
have the first challenge is a lack of

00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,449
space nack we don't have any more the

00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:49,699
device the visual device will need to

00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:52,460
adapt regarding the the display

00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:55,070
information large amount of results so

00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:56,930
you just so before all the pagination or

00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:58,699
the result that you can have here with

00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,860
the voice search we will not be able to

00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:04,220
list all the result that the certain I

00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:07,460
will get so we really need to narrow the

00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:10,430
request to know exactly what the user is

00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:12,229
looking for how to clarify like we saw

00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:14,659
before with again does like the search

00:06:12,229 --> 00:06:16,490
on try suggest something to the to the

00:06:14,659 --> 00:06:18,740
user with the voice search we will need

00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:21,050
to really to clarify and to have the

00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:24,139
exact request once again in order to

00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:27,320
give the good result the stop words on

00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:31,610
noise in the queries so users today I

00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:33,500
are more for bones yeah sorry so the

00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,320
queries are more verbose yeah exactly

00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:39,050
and when you use a classic search on try

00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:41,210
you are more used to have like a

00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,479
keywords but when you go to a voice

00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,490
search we are more

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,990
willing to talk like a conversation so

00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,759
you will say I would like something

00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,169
instead of to put only the keywords so

00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,409
this is another challenge that will have

00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:54,270
to answer it so if you if you go from

00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:57,419
auto-completion where you just typed

00:06:54,270 --> 00:07:01,319
three letters right and you come to

00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:06,419
voice search actually the query will be

00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:08,789
much larger and the last one the field

00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:11,189
to express other search keywords we will

00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:13,469
go deep into this subject but for

00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:15,689
example when you have organic organic

00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:18,300
tomato for example organic can be taken

00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:21,779
as a filter and the voice search will

00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:24,990
need to focus on what is a keyword and

00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:27,090
what can be a filter okay so let's see

00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:30,960
how we we tackle these challenges how we

00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:34,469
we deal with them so before we start

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,090
let's see what classical search engine

00:07:34,469 --> 00:07:37,919
so a search engine that displays

00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:41,610
something that you just saw on large

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:44,460
screen on an on mobile so usually no

00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:47,699
matter what search engine it is it needs

00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:53,310
an input and it's usually a text filters

00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:55,469
and some sorting information and as an

00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:57,960
output the search engine can give of

00:07:55,469 --> 00:07:59,729
course results and it can give like the

00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:03,830
first page of results the first page

00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:07,289
like of the first 100 M or 1000 however

00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:09,960
whatever it can also give suggestions

00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:11,689
like did you mean something else by your

00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:15,300
query by your request

00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:18,210
it can give facets and not just one it

00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,189
can give several facets and it can also

00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:22,379
give like additional information like

00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:25,110
something like the admin of the search

00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:26,669
engine has pushed on in the results we

00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:29,969
can call the marketing marketing

00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:32,490
shortcuts so all these things can be

00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:35,099
displayed on a screen this is our

00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,630
classical search engine works so now the

00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:38,599
challenge will be like to move for a

00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:42,539
classical search on Jai to a search

00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:44,790
search for Sanjay so the first step

00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:46,740
would be like translating the voice into

00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:50,790
text and then the second step will be

00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:53,069
like finding out what's the intent of

00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:54,540
the user because you can talk to a

00:08:53,069 --> 00:08:55,340
search engine but you can have like

00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,780
several service

00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:59,120
is like a service that looks for

00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:02,500
locations for store locations and a

00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:05,420
service like that looks like for product

00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,880
products so the first the first step

00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:12,050
whether the second step is to figure out

00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:14,900
the intent so for the speech-to-text

00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:17,990
part you actually have very powerful

00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:21,950
tools provided by Google Amazon and all

00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:24,560
the big ones if however you decide to go

00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:26,300
by yourself it's possible but it will be

00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,020
hard we actually tried to build a

00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:33,040
prototype at Dillion and yeah it works

00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:39,200
but it's like like it's really hard we

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:42,860
yeah so the voice the sound waves are

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,080
translated into like phonemes and then

00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:50,780
the foam phonemes are classified like

00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:52,940
categorized the most relevant ones and

00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:54,590
then the other ones and then we are

00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,800
searching these phonemes into a

00:09:54,590 --> 00:10:01,670
dictionary so the quality of your

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:03,560
speech-to-text engine is kind of related

00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:06,500
to the quality of your dictionary for

00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,870
example you might have said fan and

00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:11,870
gloves and the search and order the

00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:14,390
speech-to-text engine finds phone and

00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:18,770
globes because your dictionary doesn't

00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:20,830
have these two words so the output of

00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:23,510
the dictionary is called hypothesis

00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:25,460
hypothesis and you have like not just

00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:29,930
one you have like probabilities and

00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:34,280
stuff like that the second part which is

00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:36,650
like what's the intent of the user am i

00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:39,010
searching am i using the shop search

00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:42,050
service or the product search service

00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:44,420
it's actually already provided out of

00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:48,410
the box with all the voice assistants

00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:51,560
out there so being Google or Amazon so

00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:53,990
they are all using the same pattern so

00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:57,110
the first one is the intent the second

00:10:53,990 --> 00:11:01,100
one is you Terrence's so you Torrance's

00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:03,800
are like templates so templates of

00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:06,160
phrases that define the intent for

00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,279
example if you say I am looking for

00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,889
something

00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:13,350
then the engine will say okay you want

00:11:10,889 --> 00:11:17,870
to call the product search service if

00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:20,519
you say where is something then the

00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:24,180
voice assistant will say ok you will

00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:29,430
want you will call the search location

00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:31,620
service and the last the last point here

00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:36,269
the lot the last definition here is slot

00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:38,970
Amazon cause it entities is what's the

00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:41,309
parameters that you provide to the to

00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:43,680
the service so it's like methods and

00:11:41,309 --> 00:11:46,019
parameters in this example Tomatoes is

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:51,800
the parameters I am looking for tomatoes

00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:55,110
and the the intent is the product search

00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,629
very quickly on this imagine that you

00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:00,290
want to integrate your search engine

00:11:56,629 --> 00:12:03,029
yeah being yeah Google or something else

00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:07,050
in this example I took a search engine

00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:09,180
that we built which is called a 2 it

00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:12,480
goes like this or the device like Google

00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:14,699
home for example course the assistant

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,680
the voice assistant then it goes so this

00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:21,750
one is taken from Google so this one is

00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:24,000
yeah uses Google terms and technology we

00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:26,009
we go through dialogue fro and then you

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,600
need a piece of software the green one a

00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:32,759
to proxy there that will actually adapt

00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:35,670
the calls to your search engine search

00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:38,970
engine so you can just take any search

00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:41,939
engine and plug it in but as you will

00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:43,500
see you have to also adapt if you want

00:12:41,939 --> 00:12:48,029
to something relevant if you want to

00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:50,399
have something relevant ok so just to

00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:51,750
conclude this part so first of all you

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,059
will have the user speaking with his

00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,399
voice the voice will be transformed to

00:12:54,059 --> 00:12:58,199
text with the functionality

00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:00,720
speech-to-text sorry and then you will

00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:03,269
have what just losing lucien talk about

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,970
our intent utterance and slot to

00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:07,980
recognize what which which service to

00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:10,350
call and everything and then this is

00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:13,829
where you can plug we can connect your

00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:14,879
search engine so now the first challenge

00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:16,920
so like a talk before

00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:21,759
laço space to display information so

00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:24,100
let's go for this one ok

00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:26,529
yes there are two possibilities here for

00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:30,220
for when you when you're talking to a

00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:32,680
search engine you you have sometimes you

00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:35,350
can have some display a smaller one a

00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:38,709
small display but you you can have it if

00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:40,480
you look at a car you have you have like

00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:43,810
you can talk to the car but the car can

00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,670
also display things on a screen and also

00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:50,440
the the assistants that are found in

00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:53,019
your in your phone they can talk to you

00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:57,880
but they can also display something okay

00:13:53,019 --> 00:14:00,940
so it helps as you will see and yeah the

00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,680
second the second way of interacting

00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:05,620
with a search engine is like voice only

00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:07,839
and there it's much more difficult you

00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:13,240
actually don't have any space to display

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:15,430
anything you just talk to the user so

00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:20,589
second wall second one large amount of

00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:22,180
results how to narrow the request so

00:14:20,589 --> 00:14:25,990
there's there's a quick win solution

00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:28,810
here so actually the search engine will

00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:31,389
have to respond to the user with a

00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:34,990
question because you cannot respond with

00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:37,630
results facets suggestions and other

00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:39,940
informations other information so you

00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:42,370
will have to respond with a question so

00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:44,170
why not why not taking filters you say

00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:47,529
okay let's pick a filter and then ask

00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:51,430
the user which brand do you like what

00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:54,100
flavor for the ice cream but the issue

00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:56,440
there is that you can have many facets

00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:58,569
and we added the challenge is which

00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,880
facet to choose for the first question

00:14:58,569 --> 00:15:03,490
for the second question there's also a

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:07,029
pre-requisite there is that your search

00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:12,040
engine has to have facets and the facet

00:15:07,029 --> 00:15:18,730
that it has must be relevant it can be

00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:20,290
not the case so if we go further this is

00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:23,470
the example of a search engine that

00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:25,870
doesn't have facets so actually this is

00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:27,399
an example taken from Wikipedia and we

00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:29,620
are using hero a technology called

00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:31,449
carrot carrot search there is a plugin

00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,770
for elastic search for solar so you can

00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:37,480
plug it it to

00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:39,550
you have to any search engine so when

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,279
you search for orange oranges

00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:44,800
actually this is ambiguous and Wikipedia

00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:49,570
doesn't help facets it cannot say oh

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:51,850
okay what kind of voyages so you could

00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:54,700
use what we call clustering so this is

00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:58,750
like carrot search does that for us and

00:15:54,700 --> 00:16:01,180
you could respond to the user with a

00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:04,480
question that is do you mean the color

00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:05,290
do you mean the city in California do

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,310
you mean

00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:15,130
the company do you mean the fruit so

00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:17,140
yeah this is the disambiguation part so

00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:19,060
the first one will be the stop word on

00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:23,920
nose in the query so you will see how to

00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:26,020
get rid of this yeah so this is when you

00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,709
get off road what what does what does

00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:29,500
that mean

00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:31,060
if you are using a voice assistant you

00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,820
will notice that sometimes the voice

00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:36,880
assistant says I don't understand what

00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:40,350
you just asked me and then you say well

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,610
I'm just asking you the same thing as

00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:46,240
usually but I'm just using some other

00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:48,790
words why can't you adapt so thing is

00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,260
that when you define uterine seas within

00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:52,480
your voice assistant actually you have

00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:55,870
to be precise you you have to to say

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:59,589
your uterus is our I am looking for I am

00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:01,510
searching for please give me no no so

00:16:59,589 --> 00:17:03,250
you have to define all these way of

00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:07,059
interacting with with the search engine

00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:10,630
but this is like limited and there's a

00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:12,730
reason for why these voice assistance

00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:14,770
function like that why they work like

00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:17,500
that is because we have a history there

00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:21,939
we have 20 years of search engines that

00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:24,910
are made for text so the voice

00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:30,190
assistance tries to narrow your search

00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:32,440
to a keyword but if you go off-road for

00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:33,610
example yeah you ask a question that the

00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,130
the search engine and the voice

00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:37,480
assistant has never seen for example

00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:39,790
this one I'm searching for some a

00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:44,110
win-win our conference is on an elastic

00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:45,480
search or yeah what's the best way to

00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:49,410
plug this

00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:51,360
cable it's like real word and if the

00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:53,760
admin of the voice assistant hasn't

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,160
thought about this way of asking the

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:59,669
search engine yeah you cannot respond so

00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:03,270
what how can we tackle that

00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:05,280
so actually yeah we have a demo on this

00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:07,710
but we'll go faster because we have

00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:12,990
another demo in the end with a real

00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:15,240
voice assistant in order to remove the

00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:20,760
noise in the query there's a notion of

00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:24,480
stop words now you might say well stop

00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:26,610
words are yeah no longer fashioned

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,860
anymore because you can use a common

00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:31,559
terms query those who work with

00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:33,900
elasticsearch know what I mean actually

00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:36,750
will common term scurry will not help

00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:39,990
and you will understand why if I take

00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:42,059
this this query I am looking for

00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:46,740
chocolate please could you help me with

00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:49,380
that the one and single interesting word

00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:51,030
in this query the keyword that you have

00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:55,110
to pass to the search engine is

00:18:51,030 --> 00:19:01,410
chocolate all the other ones are just

00:18:55,110 --> 00:19:03,690
noise okay so when and these words are

00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:06,419
found in the query that you sent to the

00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:08,970
engine and they are not found in the

00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:11,790
products that you have indexed for

00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:14,280
example so they are not stop words from

00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:18,900
the common terms query point of view

00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:22,530
okay and you even might have these words

00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:25,830
like looking or help or could may our

00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:29,929
please you might even have them within

00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:34,080
your index indices but they are not that

00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:37,049
frequent so they are not stop words from

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:40,110
the common terms query point of view so

00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:41,490
actually yeah this is the pitfall so

00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:44,850
what's the solution the solution would

00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:48,690
be to index the queries okay so actually

00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:50,610
you you will take the logs the glogs of

00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:55,890
your queries the logs from your users

00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:58,140
and you will index those and then you

00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,559
will run some aggregations on those on

00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,320
top of

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:03,450
those and you will see which are the

00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,490
real stop words considering your use

00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:07,169
case so in this example so I will not

00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:08,460
show you the demo for that it's really

00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:11,759
technical and it's connected to

00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:19,529
elasticsearch but the idea is like you

00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:23,999
have here on the left the the index the

00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:26,210
in D the what you indexed from the query

00:20:23,999 --> 00:20:31,529
logs so the logs that you indexed and

00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:33,929
they are they are stemmed so this is why

00:20:31,529 --> 00:20:37,200
you say like way look instead of looking

00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:40,950
searching they are stand so you you can

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,289
see that the word I is really frequent

00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:44,970
seven times because I indexed some

00:20:43,289 --> 00:20:47,399
queries there actually I indexed all the

00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:49,679
queries that we have in the in the in

00:20:47,399 --> 00:20:53,490
the examples you will notice also that

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:57,210
four is very frequent and so am the

00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:59,429
search too then you say okay we'll just

00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:02,279
apply the standards the standard stop

00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:05,700
words and you will see that for example

00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:07,710
four disappeared because it is part of

00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:10,320
the standards stop words in elastic

00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:13,799
search for example or in routine but I

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:17,639
is not part of that list and neither

00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:21,659
search searching or looking so yeah you

00:21:17,639 --> 00:21:23,789
can add some custom stop words which are

00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:26,460
really connected to your use cases and

00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:28,830
then remove them so here in the third

00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:32,789
table you can see that we removed

00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:35,519
searching looking and yeah we remove

00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:38,190
some other additional words okay so this

00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:40,409
is like an admin job and the third one

00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:43,499
the fourth one the fourth table is like

00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:45,720
you can also take into account shingles

00:21:43,499 --> 00:21:48,179
like it you can take expressions that

00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,940
really repeat frequently for example I

00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:53,759
am searching it's actually repeats three

00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:58,409
times so you can say okay this is noise

00:21:53,759 --> 00:22:08,159
I will just remove that so much for this

00:21:58,409 --> 00:22:10,559
we will move on 15 minutes left okay

00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:13,049
so the last one is filter expressed as

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,970
search keyword so like I said before

00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:18,509
we'll see some examples so maybe we can

00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:21,029
move on yeah for example here so we have

00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:23,250
organic tomato for example an organic

00:22:21,029 --> 00:22:25,619
can be taken as a filter in order to

00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,960
improve the requests we have another

00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:30,869
example Simon Warner talks on elastic

00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:35,730
shot cinnamon can be a filter and can be

00:22:30,869 --> 00:22:38,429
a filter like type of speaker so maybe

00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:41,909
you want to go for the solution yeah so

00:22:38,429 --> 00:22:46,919
the idea is that when you're talking to

00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:50,220
like widow Widow with your voice yeah

00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:53,669
these terms will end up as as keywords

00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:55,409
but they are actually filters so yeah as

00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:59,700
you said so that the first solution is

00:22:55,409 --> 00:23:02,730
that you you actually extract entities

00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:06,179
so how do you extract entities that's

00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:09,210
another part of the story we will not

00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:11,159
talk about that here but yeah you figure

00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:14,610
out a way to extract entities from the

00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:17,309
users query and for the first example

00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:19,590
which is organic Tomatoes you say okay

00:23:17,309 --> 00:23:23,009
the text is tomato and actually the

00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:26,490
organic there is a filter which is and

00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:29,940
then you can just ask your search engine

00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:32,549
organic flag equals true and then you

00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:37,639
have the query that you will call on

00:23:32,549 --> 00:23:41,490
your API on the second example you might

00:23:37,639 --> 00:23:43,619
realize that the name there is actually

00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:45,389
a speaker so you place it in the into

00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:49,230
the speaker

00:23:45,389 --> 00:23:50,879
filter and then you end up with a

00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:52,859
curried that says the text is

00:23:50,879 --> 00:23:55,499
elasticsearch the speaker is simon view

00:23:52,859 --> 00:23:58,259
now and the type of the document that

00:23:55,499 --> 00:24:01,379
you want to return is a talk now so you

00:23:58,259 --> 00:24:04,440
just rephrase the query which initially

00:24:01,379 --> 00:24:08,279
was just a text and it actually

00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:13,259
contained filters you rephrased it in

00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:15,629
order to express filters and text the

00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:19,350
second solution is like it's more

00:24:15,629 --> 00:24:21,750
simpler like you don't do anything you

00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:22,500
are just taking the query and throw it

00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:27,120
out to those

00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:29,490
search engine and hope the the scoring

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,790
algorithms will work for you so yeah you

00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:34,950
hope for the best and this might work

00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:37,140
but there are some conditions there for

00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:39,980
example if organic is just a flag that

00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:43,980
says true or false this will not work

00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:50,190
because you will not see organic as a

00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:54,000
word into your data so you have to be

00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:58,200
careful here yeah you have for example

00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:01,800
if you have a product base that says

00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:04,500
yeah tomatoes and the organic indication

00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,960
says just a flag with true and false as

00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:13,020
a value you might want to transform that

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:15,180
to real text and say organic text equals

00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:21,600
organic or something and the second

00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:24,540
solution will work for you so here is

00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,700
like the take away so this is what we

00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:28,860
saw before so first of all the user will

00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:30,290
speak with his voice then he will

00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:33,390
translate to the speech-to-text

00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:35,250
functionality and then the intent and

00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:37,140
the uterus and the stock part what we

00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:39,600
saw before just to know exactly what

00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:42,420
services to call and what are the

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:44,970
variables and then you put your search

00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:46,290
on China and here are the let's say the

00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:47,880
ends where that we found for these

00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:51,180
different challenges so for example for

00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:53,100
the first one in order to to have

00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:56,100
information even if we don't have like

00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:58,440
visual device we need to ask question

00:25:56,100 --> 00:26:00,720
for the second one we need to add filter

00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,510
in order to narrow and to go directly to

00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,150
the result the more relevant result the

00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:11,400
result for if if you want to add

00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:13,800
something yes so the the first take way

00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:16,410
is that the in order you don't respond

00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:19,380
with a response you respond with a

00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:21,930
question and the second one is that you

00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:24,500
don't paginate the results or you don't

00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:27,330
display ten results you actually add

00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,530
filters to the query so you narrow down

00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:31,680
the

00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:34,830
the result because when you talk to the

00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:38,220
user you can maybe say like so one

00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:40,350
product or two products but not not for

00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:42,510
the third one - how to clarify so we saw

00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:46,950
the facet the cluster ization and the

00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:50,850
personalization so we just we didn't dig

00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:52,460
into the personalization thing there but

00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:55,350
it's really important because

00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:58,470
personalization allows a search engine

00:26:55,350 --> 00:27:00,990
to be more relevant and especially this

00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:04,820
goes especially for voice search if

00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:08,670
someone else asks for let's say milk on

00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:10,620
on a grocery store depending who asks

00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,550
the question the response might be

00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:15,030
different yeah

00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:18,480
is it body milk is it milk for babies or

00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:21,510
yeah but if you know the user that asks

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,550
the question then you can be more

00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:26,400
relevant and actually you add filters to

00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:28,710
the query which are taken from the user

00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,260
profile so this is personalization we

00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:35,330
actually didn't dig into this one but

00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:38,340
it's it's a way to clarify the request

00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:40,650
in order to avoid the noise so you need

00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:43,380
to index query and to create your list

00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:46,770
of top word regarding to you own use

00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:49,860
case and the most relevant stop word for

00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:52,250
your for your problem for uses and last

00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:54,720
one so the filter that we just saw

00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:57,750
yeah maybe you want to take this one

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,580
yeah so this is the query rewriting yeah

00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:03,570
the one that we saw that you you have

00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:06,480
like you have like queries that are

00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:08,280
expect expressed as just text and you

00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:12,600
rewrite the query to say text and

00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:15,180
filters yeah so or the second solution

00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:17,400
you make the filter searchable and hope

00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:24,060
for the scoring algorithm to work for

00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:27,480
you so we actually yeah have a have a

00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:31,290
demo for it for you which kind of

00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:32,880
emphasizes this part so we will try to

00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:38,220
make it work

00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:41,230
so yeah we as you saw we took a search

00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:44,950
engine which is a classical one

00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:46,809
we are kind of on this architecture you

00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:53,039
took a search engine that is this one

00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:59,850
and we tried to query it through the

00:28:53,039 --> 00:29:03,220
Google assistant okay

00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:08,230
sorry I have to stop the presentation in

00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:08,710
order in order for this to work so here

00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:11,049
it is

00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:15,130
so Margot do you want to take that so

00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:18,100
just bear with us it's like it's a live

00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:20,049
demo and as you will see there is a lot

00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:22,809
like machine learning and stuff there

00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:26,019
and the search engine like needs to to

00:29:22,809 --> 00:29:36,730
adapt if it's not working we will try to

00:29:26,019 --> 00:29:38,980
hack it but yeah this is the yeah so I

00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:40,659
think we will skip this one so in order

00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:44,230
to launch the application you actually

00:29:40,659 --> 00:29:46,659
need to say talk to the engine or

00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:49,299
something like that we just click we

00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:51,519
just click on the so as you see here

00:29:49,299 --> 00:29:54,669
it's like all right let's get the test

00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:58,630
version of a to welcome just what are

00:29:54,669 --> 00:30:01,600
you looking for today so if we pause a

00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:04,269
little bit here what you just saw here

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,970
it's a simulator so the advantage of

00:30:04,269 --> 00:30:10,120
this and it's the same on a phone you

00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:12,460
have some display there so the the the

00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:14,590
search engine actually can give you

00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:18,070
hints on what's accepted and what's not

00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:21,190
accepted okay so this is and if you look

00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:23,260
if you look just a few seconds if you

00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:26,620
look here actually the input can be

00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:29,649
voice can be touchscreen or can be even

00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:35,350
keyboard you can even write queries to

00:30:29,649 --> 00:30:37,830
the to the to the engine known also the

00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:37,830
mic is there

00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:50,590
I found 920 products for you what is

00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:53,470
your favorite brand so what what just

00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:59,500
happened there is that we had the intent

00:30:53,470 --> 00:31:00,940
there the so Google assistant found the

00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,340
intent which is I am searching for

00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:08,310
products because I said I am looking for

00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:11,020
if Margo would have said I would like

00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:13,270
some chocolate it might not have worked

00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:15,400
because the intent was not defined like

00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:19,240
that okay so this is something that you

00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:21,010
see on on your on your phone and this is

00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:23,260
how the engine responded actually

00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:26,350
because there are too many results there

00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:28,630
we cannot display 920 results for this

00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:30,640
particular search we cannot display the

00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:32,650
fastest there but the the piece of

00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:36,310
software that we placed as an adapter

00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:39,910
just chose a facet out there which

00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:42,730
happens to be the brand and just

00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:46,510
responded with a question okay because

00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:48,550
yeah we have too many results there so

00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:50,260
yeah let's try let's try this one is

00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:53,820
difficult to pronounce but yeah we will

00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:53,820
try like lint yeah

00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:03,840
you have to talk louder I think

00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:14,000
the best product I have found for you is

00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:17,600
Cho : owaru are lint okay you wear for

00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:21,680
the Sun it's a yeah it's a it's French

00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:23,750
there so the pronunciation is like so

00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:28,340
yeah this is the the first product so

00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:31,640
actually we have not many results of the

00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:34,880
engine could I mean we took the chance

00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:37,580
to ask - to answer with a result let's

00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:47,860
say we don't like this one and then yeah

00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:47,860
we provide the way to go further well

00:32:50,570 --> 00:33:01,169
that was a yes but you know it's a yeah

00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:08,929
we can stop and we just we just send a

00:33:01,169 --> 00:33:08,929
yes like by keyword and ah yeah just

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:17,610
okay okay son Daniel we we have here are

00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:20,370
the next three products okay

00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:23,460
now let's imagine that this is not

00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:25,890
enough so for example if we choose

00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:28,890
another brand and we still have too many

00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:38,039
products okay so yeah we have to go from

00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:40,620
the beginning there are some maybe you

00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:42,870
can speak I found 920 products for you

00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:50,010
what is your favorite brand that's a no

00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:58,110
surprise there oh yeah go for me oh yeah

00:33:50,010 --> 00:34:03,809
there's what this one and this

00:33:58,110 --> 00:34:06,590
understood your request okay try again

00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:06,590
maybe yeah

00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:14,270
okay I found 38 products for you should

00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:16,670
I look in which department okay so this

00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:19,220
second iteration there are actually

00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:23,270
still too many products they still

00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:26,090
cannot be displayed so you could decide

00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:35,960
to ask a second question okay so to say

00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:39,440
yeah okay what happens there that was I

00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:41,740
misunderstood your request if you speak

00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:45,230
in the mic maybe it will be better

00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:50,540
that's right so we will just choose some

00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:52,700
some ice cream there so no no that's

00:34:50,540 --> 00:35:04,010
that's okay if you say again frozen food

00:34:52,700 --> 00:35:06,440
it will work frozen food that's the best

00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:09,290
product I have found for you is glasses

00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:11,990
show Cola and the knee Milka do you want

00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:13,730
more results so here yeah you as you

00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:15,800
noticed you need needed a second

00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:17,600
iteration so you display the facet at

00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,700
first which was the brand and then

00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:22,850
another facet which was the department

00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:25,400
and then there were like not many

00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:28,130
results so it was it was okay to display

00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:33,680
them so let's say we don't want any more

00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:37,880
results and yeah I think I don't know if

00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:39,500
we have more time or not you can say no

00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:46,360
yeah thank you all

00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:46,360
no no

00:35:53,570 --> 00:36:01,690
I think there's some noise here so the

00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:01,690
sir it waits for Oh for some more input

00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:17,450
yeah I misunderstood your request

00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:19,820
okay so just just type no thank you you

00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:22,430
are welcome have a great time at Berlin

00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:24,200
buzzwords okay so that ends the

00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:29,869
conversation we do with the search

00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:31,910
engine or so yeah so thank you for for

00:36:29,869 --> 00:36:34,849
being present and for your patience I

00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:38,900
hope the French examples didn't bother

00:36:34,849 --> 00:36:42,140
you too much I don't know if we haven't

00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:45,020
yet time for some questions if you have

00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:47,359
questions we'd be happy to respond and

00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:53,420
if not we'll be around till the end of

00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:56,920
the day with the conference okay thank

00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:59,300
you for the talk can you customize

00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:01,520
suggestion somehow so like if when you

00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:03,200
we're searching for chocolate you don't

00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:06,170
get white buttons or anything like

00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:09,440
outside of your search scope so like if

00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:11,450
you have like a database of products can

00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,910
you customize voice-to-text

00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:18,440
to only understand these kind of

00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:21,650
products you have your database so the

00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:25,190
question is if we can customize the

00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:27,200
search engine in order for it to like to

00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:31,430
to already know that we are looking for

00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:36,200
some specific product or I'm not sure

00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:40,910
that I understood the point yeah it's a

00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:43,210
yeah we need to so actually i'm

00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:47,480
answering with a question

00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:51,859
so like to customize the text or the

00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:54,619
voice to text engine to only suggest a

00:37:51,859 --> 00:37:58,099
keywords from your database not a

00:37:54,619 --> 00:38:00,650
generic keywords the suggestions that

00:37:58,099 --> 00:38:03,290
you saw there are not generic are

00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:06,319
actually facets that the search engine

00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:09,490
returns so you have seen oh I don't know

00:38:06,319 --> 00:38:09,490
if we can scroll up

00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:16,250
yeah when you say yeah for example if I

00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:19,790
say I'm looking for chocolates alright

00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:22,700
here's the test version of a to welcome

00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:30,680
what are you looking for today I am

00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:32,150
looking for chocolate so what I'm

00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:34,760
talking about like this word set for

00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:41,450
syllable or dairy like this kind of

00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:43,370
words okay so yeah the dirty 420

00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:45,080
products for you what is your favorite

00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:47,090
brand okay so I understand No

00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:50,360
so the these suggestions are actually

00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:54,110
real real suggestions I mean they are

00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:55,850
present in the database dairy there was

00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:57,590
not present in the database but actually

00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:59,330
these are just suggestions you can say

00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:02,660
something else because it displays the

00:38:59,330 --> 00:39:05,390
first five the first files value for

00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:07,790
your facets but not the other one so you

00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:11,930
actually can say here any word you like

00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:14,390
so the engine is like kind of it has to

00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:18,290
take your input into account and if your

00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:20,300
input is dairy let's say yeah it takes

00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:22,250
it and it says okay I'll send that to

00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:25,310
the engine but the answer is like void

00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:28,070
there's no there's no result there so

00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:32,900
this is yeah this is a risk and you

00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:34,820
cannot handle that actually it's a yeah

00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:36,500
this is the machine learning behind the

00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:39,050
voice recognition and stuff like that

00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:41,060
that would get better and better so now

00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:43,940
this one was trained with several voices

00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:46,970
because we were several persons to work

00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:50,050
on this demo and yeah it's normal that

00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:54,170
maybe it does not understand

00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:55,850
Margeaux for example right like that but

00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:58,130
there it should be taken into account

00:39:55,850 --> 00:40:01,880
yeah so it's actually an information

00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:06,230
that it's pushed to the engine now thank

00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,890
thanks for the question yeah hi thank

00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:09,050
you

00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:11,510
you mentioned that one of the things we

00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:13,070
don't have with a voice assistant is you

00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:14,540
called it marketing shortcuts but I

00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:19,280
think we're all more familiar with it as

00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:21,210
ads what there's a lot of businesses

00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,279
that would be very upset about that

00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:27,720
do you have any suggestions on how we

00:40:23,279 --> 00:40:30,480
can address that actually sometimes we

00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:32,640
call them best bets they can be

00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:34,260
something else than ads it depends on

00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,240
the search engine if the certainiy

00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:39,180
search engine it's it's an enterprise

00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:41,390
search engine they are not actually ads

00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:43,529
they are something that the

00:40:41,390 --> 00:40:46,170
administrator of the search engine

00:40:43,529 --> 00:40:49,380
what's to push to the user because he

00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:52,950
knows the the business he knows the meta

00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:56,010
domain and he knows that maybe the best

00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:58,920
result for this particular query is this

00:40:56,010 --> 00:41:02,369
landing page that I already prepared so

00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:06,720
yeah it's it's a it's an issue yeah how

00:41:02,369 --> 00:41:13,200
do you push like publicity or admin

00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:16,140
really admin related results but yeah I

00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:19,829
mean it's up to you to to build up the

00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:22,500
the answer that you want so you could

00:41:19,829 --> 00:41:24,720
have like an algorithm that says okay I

00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:28,589
have a suggestion from an admin or I

00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:31,470
have a publicity there you could say is

00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:33,809
it relevant is it really really relevant

00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:36,569
more relevant than the results there can

00:41:33,809 --> 00:41:38,940
I take the risk to display that so it's

00:41:36,569 --> 00:41:40,799
actually the the green box that it's the

00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:43,380
adapter between your search engine and

00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:45,589
the voice assistant that can tell so

00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:49,470
it's actually something that you decide

00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:52,859
when you build the the adapter and the

00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:54,299
voice search engine okay and we take the

00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:57,750
last question because we are terribly

00:41:54,299 --> 00:42:00,029
out of time I thank you for the

00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:02,460
interesting talk so I have a very small

00:42:00,029 --> 00:42:06,109
question that you spoke about limiting

00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:08,910
your search results - you were using

00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:10,799
carrot for clustering face sitting and

00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:12,630
personalization I'm just wondering how

00:42:10,799 --> 00:42:15,539
do you Club them and how exactly do you

00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:19,440
kind of narrow the results down using

00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:21,510
that so actually carrot is not used for

00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,339
personalization but it's useful for

00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:27,690
clustering yes

00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:32,309
so yeah that's that's a great question

00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:33,400
so clustering algorithms actually allow

00:42:32,309 --> 00:42:37,060
you to

00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:41,830
bring facets to some results that do not

00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:47,050
have facets and then it's up to you how

00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:50,890
you work with that so you could say for

00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:52,930
example the example with oranges there

00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:55,450
was really ambiguous because you had

00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:58,300
clusters that has had come kind of the

00:42:55,450 --> 00:43:02,080
same size okay so you could have like

00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:04,810
some algorithms there some you can't

00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:07,690
even plug machine learning there to say

00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:10,090
okay when I don't have facets but I have

00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:14,260
too many results I will try to use

00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:16,990
clusters and then if I have like two or

00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:20,950
three clusters that are as big and they

00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:23,320
are like they stand out I will ask a

00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:28,060
question to say okay please give me

00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:30,220
another another hint like and another

00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:33,010
hint means like you add another word to

00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:35,440
the query or lock like and you can even

00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:37,570
take suggestions from the clustering

00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:42,700
algorithms for example if we go back to

00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:51,640
the to the presentation it was yeah so I

00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:53,260
don't know where it was yeah so yeah you

00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:55,540
can you could you know even use the

00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:58,210
words from here so you can say color you

00:43:55,540 --> 00:44:01,420
can say California you can say orange sa

00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:02,980
which is the company so yeah and this is

00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:04,750
just a graphical display but you

00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:06,940
actually can tell more about that

00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:08,920
because you can tell that orange sa it's

00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:12,520
a company so you could also have some

00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:14,530
additional treatment there in order to

00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:17,470
transform these clusters into real

00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:20,050
questions that you asked the user so you

00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:22,570
could transform these two questions like

00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:25,240
is it orange the company because this is

00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:26,980
Wikipedia so you could have some some

00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:29,320
additional information there is it

00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:32,140
orange the color so yeah

00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:34,030
you have some more work to do there in

00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:37,420
order to adapt your a search engine but

00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:40,330
yeah it's a it's more complicating than

00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:44,790
just displaying facets you have filter

00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:44,790
suggestions from coming from facets yeah

00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:52,380
thank you so much for for this

00:44:50,070 --> 00:44:54,450
fascinating talk this is really

00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:56,310
inspiring thank you for coming and

00:44:54,450 --> 00:45:00,090
thanks for burning buzzwords for having

00:44:56,310 --> 00:45:01,420
us and thank you all of you for for

00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:04,219
having come

00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:04,219
