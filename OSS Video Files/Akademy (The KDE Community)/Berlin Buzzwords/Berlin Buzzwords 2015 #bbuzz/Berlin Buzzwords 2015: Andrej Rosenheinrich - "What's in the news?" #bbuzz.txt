Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2015: Andrej Rosenheinrich - "What's in the news?" #bbuzz

Description: 
	Andrej Rosenheinrich talking about '"What's in the news?' - or: why Angela Merkel is not significant"

Bluekiwi.de, Unister's meta search engine, offers an explicit search over news articles. But what about the user who wants to inform herself on what is actually new and important? Watching hundreds of news sources, we collect thousands of news every day - far too many to read or present concisely. So the question becomes how to aggregate, summarize and present the important news of the day.

In this talk, we want to present some strategies we used to aggregate news, figure out what is important and not just common, and what techniques can be used to come up with descriptive teasers. These teasers could be used in turn to trigger useful search queries, thus providing the user with the full news stories behind them. 

Our approach comprises proper entity detection and natural language processing, which we will compare to pure term based techniques. Even if this approach is certainly more laborious than 'out-of-the-box' information retrieval, it is well worth the effort, providing us with understandable and succinct summaries of what's really going on.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,030
I

00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:10,900
and hello and welcome to my talk what's

00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:13,299
in the news or langa lemarchal is not

00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,129
significant my name is Andrew was no

00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:17,590
English what I'm going to talk about

00:00:15,129 --> 00:00:19,150
today is some work I've done and some

00:00:17,590 --> 00:00:22,419
experiences have made together a

00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:24,189
colleague of mine dr. Van Dyke man was

00:00:22,419 --> 00:00:26,790
made a responsible for the natural

00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:30,130
language processing part of this project

00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:33,930
but more about that later we both work

00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:36,129
at the research and development center a

00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:40,210
department of the unit sir game behind

00:00:36,129 --> 00:00:43,990
light sick in case you haven't heard

00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:45,310
about you Nestor it's not uncommon user

00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:48,070
is one of the biggest Internet companies

00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:50,260
in Germany You certainly have heard of

00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:52,900
some of our brands with brands like

00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:55,630
happen envelope da or hi Cindy we are

00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:58,329
market leader in online travel sales in

00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:01,350
Germany we're one of the main contenders

00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:06,430
in areas like online flight ticket sales

00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:08,549
hotel reservations but apart from the

00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:11,979
travel area we also running a lot of

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:15,609
pages in areas like finance like

00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:18,039
shopping like comparison so if that's

00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:20,920
interesting for you go check the website

00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:25,600
unity and usually there are some jobs

00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:28,060
around at locations all over Germany so

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,240
at research and development department

00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:34,049
we do something slightly different our

00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:38,799
main focuses development of blue key bde

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:40,899
blue key B is a meter search and ok why

00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,639
another meet research as a question I

00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:47,409
get answered from TY asked from time to

00:01:42,639 --> 00:01:53,799
time and whatever this laptop is doing

00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:55,630
here why not me to search well doing a

00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:57,880
search is not that difficult today is

00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:00,249
set up a simple full-text search or

00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,899
whatever is something you can do there

00:02:00,249 --> 00:02:04,599
are tools around for that it's probably

00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:07,569
ready out of the box if you have to data

00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:10,509
to search and it's always one thing you

00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:11,950
have to keep in mind and what is the

00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:13,720
difference between a search and a good

00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:15,780
search it's of course the relevant of

00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,910
your relevance of your results and

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:19,560
everyone is doing

00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,600
some certain things to improve the

00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,850
relevance and two of the main ideas

00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,970
we're doing what are not so uncommon I

00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:29,280
guess is of course a semantic analysis

00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,530
of the key search query and for instance

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:34,440
here in this case the query would be

00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,300
called as Mexico and we would think that

00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,210
you probably talked about the sea Gulf

00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,250
of Mexico and present you the certain

00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:44,190
results like the defect box in the upper

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:47,340
right corner for that and so on if I

00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:49,260
would query for go if in Mexico even

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,610
that in a stop word that would not be

00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,830
considered in the full text search the

00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,450
semantic analysis tells you okay this is

00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,090
something different maybe we're talking

00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:01,500
about Mexico and the sport goals in

00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:03,780
Mexico and so semantic analysis helps

00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,670
for sure another thing that we're doing

00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,920
is we're considering the context or the

00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:10,650
context is actually something that we do

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,440
not know most of the time but context is

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,270
something that would bring different

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,860
result when i'm looking for mexico what

00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,420
am I looking for and we're looking for

00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:21,320
facts don't want to go there for

00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,580
vacation maybe I need a hotel and so on

00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,660
and so we implemented a lot of different

00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:30,209
searches in a different context and

00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:33,060
depending on what we think is the port

00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:38,220
context for the query you use we display

00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:41,220
certain boxes with with such a context

00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:43,110
and you as the user can decide what you

00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:45,030
actually want to see you want to see the

00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:48,860
hotel offers or the facts or the news or

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:52,500
whatever and as I mentioned one of them

00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:58,680
one of the context modes we wanted to

00:03:52,500 --> 00:04:01,680
have a new search and probably a

00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,570
question I do not have to plot out that

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:07,500
much but why do we want to have a new

00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:09,570
search news our topic of amazing

00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:12,840
interest if you look at Alexa ranking of

00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:16,380
the most visited pages in Germany in the

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,419
top 25 there are at least five news or

00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:22,620
new similar we can argue about one or

00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:25,979
two of them pages that i would consider

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:29,039
as being nice or new similar think even

00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:31,409
for their domains like to online the e

00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:34,349
like gmx de that

00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:36,809
tane a lot of news so news seems to be

00:04:34,349 --> 00:04:40,169
of a huge interest and the other thing

00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:43,019
about users there's a lot of it around a

00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:45,239
lot of sources you can think of a lot of

00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:47,639
news and let's face it a lot of

00:04:45,239 --> 00:04:49,679
something you can easily you a loose

00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:53,219
overview is the perfect scenario for

00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:55,289
research right so it was a no-brainer we

00:04:53,219 --> 00:04:59,699
wanted to do new search we wanted to

00:04:55,289 --> 00:05:02,459
have it and we did what we had to do we

00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:06,629
set up a process to fetch news from many

00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:08,399
many sources constantly we do some

00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:10,919
pre-processing on the news we store the

00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,509
news in an index what is cool so we can

00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:17,069
use all the fancy features of elastic

00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:19,259
search and with that data we got we

00:05:17,069 --> 00:05:21,539
implemented the search on it our

00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:24,959
designers came up with screen front and

00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:26,519
team put on the page and voila there we

00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:30,599
go we have a new search with the news

00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:33,269
box it looks good for us the results are

00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:37,439
good uses like it we like it everyone's

00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:42,329
happy but as usual you have a huge

00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:45,419
amount of data laying around and for

00:05:42,329 --> 00:05:47,249
sure you start thinking about what can

00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:51,059
we do with that data it's interesting

00:05:47,249 --> 00:05:53,039
and we have a lot of news actually it's

00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:57,539
pretty obvious what you can do or what

00:05:53,039 --> 00:06:00,389
you would like to do what you'd like to

00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:02,579
do is aggregate news imagine they're

00:06:00,389 --> 00:06:06,689
more than 100 newspapers in Germany

00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:10,110
every newspaper is writing about how the

00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:12,239
last soccer game actually went the

00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:14,129
result is the same everywhere you don't

00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:15,989
have to display it 100 times just show

00:06:14,129 --> 00:06:19,019
the fact this is the result 10 or

00:06:15,989 --> 00:06:21,479
whatever and maybe you don't want to

00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:24,449
read all the news because just too many

00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:27,179
of them I want a short summary a punch

00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:32,249
line you know this is the fact we won

00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:34,919
the game and of course as part of the

00:06:32,249 --> 00:06:36,209
the title we want to figure out what are

00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:37,979
the important news if I have a five

00:06:36,209 --> 00:06:39,959
digit number of news every day I cannot

00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:42,520
read all of them I want to focus on

00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:45,860
let's say the top 10 news so

00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,900
we actually know what we want aggregate

00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:50,570
summarize find the most important news

00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:55,030
that was the task at hand the only thing

00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:57,530
we did not know is how to get there so

00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:59,600
let's start with the last thing years

00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:03,620
how can we figure out what are actually

00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:05,630
important news I'm quite sure that I'm

00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,980
not the only one who encountered the

00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:10,240
task of figuring out what is the

00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:12,800
important part in the data I have and

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,170
I'm quite sure that probably almost

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,180
everyone knows that counting is usually

00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:19,070
not a solution whatever you count you

00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:23,330
can count terms you can cut entities or

00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:26,240
whatever you got um but still everyone

00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:28,610
is trying that I tried it too it's not

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,580
working we need something different so

00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:33,820
what is an idea to figure out what news

00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:37,280
are important I had an idea in mind and

00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:40,670
I guess you can already guess what it is

00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:43,180
because it's in and in the title it's

00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:45,560
elastic source significant term

00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:49,250
aggregation that was introduced to think

00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:51,520
the beginning of last year and in case

00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:54,320
you haven't attended to talk about the

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:57,730
significant term a gregarious terday or

00:07:54,320 --> 00:08:00,440
you never heard of it was elasticsearch

00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:02,210
significant term aggregation about you

00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,000
can read up a blog post there's a very

00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:07,190
good blog post about it or you read the

00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,260
definitive guide that's worth reading

00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:11,450
anyway and the definitive guide actually

00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,310
explains it the following way the

00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,560
significant terms aggregation finds

00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:17,750
uncomely common terms in your data set

00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:20,120
what do we mean by uncommonly common

00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:23,330
these are terms that are statistically

00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:26,390
unusual a hell of a definition but what

00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:28,550
does it mean actually we compared two

00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:30,590
sets of documents one is the foreground

00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:34,340
set that is the set of documents you

00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:36,590
select by a query or however any other

00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:38,150
background set simplest case is the

00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:40,430
background set as your whole index you

00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:43,640
could narrow that down by other filters

00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:46,430
or whatever and then you compare how

00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:49,210
often do terms appear in this set of

00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:51,860
documents and if this frequency is

00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:53,600
higher in the foreground set then it is

00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,710
in the background set significantly

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,260
higher

00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:59,660
then something is happening although

00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,970
this term has a special significance

00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:04,100
between your foreground said if you

00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:06,050
imagine I have a term that is in my

00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:08,240
background set and every 50th document

00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:10,580
and my foreground set it's in every

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:14,390
third so this seems to be really really

00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:17,890
important for my foreground set so this

00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:17,890
is the idea that we wanted to use

00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:23,180
choosing the foreground set is pretty

00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:26,060
simple i could do a range query and say

00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:28,520
like give me the news of the last 24

00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:35,330
hours and then figure out okay what is

00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:37,370
important during that time with this

00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:40,610
definition in mind i can actually

00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:43,070
explain a part of my title as well

00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:45,860
because i claim that Angela Merkel is

00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:48,320
not significant why is Angela Merkel not

00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:50,840
significant well obviously because she's

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,300
in the news every day there's a poor guy

00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:56,030
and a in a new as a newspaper that has

00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:58,040
to fill the page every day or thinking

00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:01,760
about what to write and just write down

00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:04,610
and Gail I'm Atlas doing a safe bet so

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:07,190
her name will be at least 10 times in

00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:08,840
every newspaper every day think about

00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,940
even more extreme example weather

00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,580
forecasts if you take data from one

00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:15,590
newspaper there will be one article with

00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,240
weather forecast every day and no one

00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:19,370
would be amazed that tomorrow will be

00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,290
one article by the forecast so this is

00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:24,740
not significant at all this is nothing

00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:30,040
you have to look at so significant term

00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:32,900
aggregations is the idea we want to use

00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,870
but there is a problem with significant

00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:40,130
terms aggregation and that is what are

00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:44,870
the terms were you looking at we're

00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:46,970
using the headlines for a good signal

00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:49,160
charm aggregation and you could say okay

00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:51,170
I use the terms that are delivered by

00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,450
elasticsearch but the output of my

00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:56,540
analyzer that will give you a single

00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:59,300
token or maybe a bigram whatever you put

00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:01,400
your index I said your index app or the

00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:04,010
problem is this usually is not really

00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:06,440
descriptive another problem is you would

00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:08,220
not consider grammar you could come up

00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,460
with marker but you also could come

00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:14,130
with now kids and so on and the medical

00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:16,890
example usually names will be split as I

00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:18,450
said the name thing you could do with my

00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,700
grams that will save you an angular

00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:23,370
marker it wouldn't not save you and that

00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,230
being a lotus ocean a burger but you

00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:26,730
could go ahead and say okay I have a

00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,280
bunch of pi grams maybe they're

00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:31,980
overlapping my concatenate them and so

00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:35,640
on I tried all this it's really funny

00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:38,520
what results you will get but still the

00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:41,700
output will in rare cases be well-formed

00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:44,610
or make sense also ever so just working

00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:48,360
on simple terms is not going to bring

00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:49,830
you anywhere em I said we're doing

00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,620
pre-processing one of the things we're

00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:54,300
doing pre-processing as we do an entity

00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:57,120
recognition we could use the attitudes

00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:59,010
of the news for a significant term that

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,960
is cool somehow because what you will

00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:03,120
get our clean valid results you don't

00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:05,850
have to care about names you have proper

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,950
labels everything is cool still it's not

00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,600
the script of you might know that Angela

00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:13,370
Merkel was somehow important yesterday

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,840
by chance but you do not know why

00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:18,480
another thing with entities you will not

00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,850
find new news if your entity recognition

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,830
does not know the term you're talking

00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:24,840
about a company / introducing a new

00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:27,690
product you will not realize that this

00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:30,080
is important and not being able to

00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:35,550
detect something new and use this

00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:37,320
mistake for sure and last thing and that

00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,970
is a problem for both of it you cannot

00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,150
aggregate on this news i said we want to

00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:44,130
aggregate but if i know that i have the

00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:46,560
term angela merkel or the entity angela

00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:48,480
merkel and it is contained in angular

00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,610
market means francois hollande as well

00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,340
as angela merkel meets Vladimir Putin

00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:55,080
but you cannot a great and debt because

00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:57,600
it's the same years it's a different

00:12:55,080 --> 00:13:00,450
news and you have to figure out

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,800
something different so at least here we

00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,540
noticed that we have a conceptual

00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,570
problem of the whole thing they have to

00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:09,480
think about something different and the

00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:11,430
solution here was pretty obvious we have

00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,280
to move away from token token being a

00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:17,010
term or an entity or just a single

00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:19,590
entity whatever you want to call it to

00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:20,579
effects we have to consider the headline

00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,920
or the news

00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:25,920
in whole and try to make effect out of

00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:27,899
it and that's where i was looking

00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,389
sitting in my office with the sad face

00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:32,399
but stuck here my colleague came up to

00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:34,019
me ask me what I'm actually trying to do

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:37,350
and how the whole thing is working and

00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:39,389
is that maybe I can help you here on

00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:42,779
that with some natural language

00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:47,819
processing approach and he came up with

00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:52,230
a four-step process that he implemented

00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:54,149
as a prototype I'll skip the step zero I

00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:57,089
explained him a detailed in a few

00:13:54,149 --> 00:13:58,739
moments but just the idea is what are we

00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:01,290
trying to achieve we want to find the

00:13:58,739 --> 00:14:04,470
important terms that summarize the

00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:08,279
sentence or the headline based on the

00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:10,739
structure of the sentence so how's it

00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:14,910
working impetus as i said the headline

00:14:10,739 --> 00:14:17,910
we do some basic NLP staff with the

00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:19,290
sentence plotting remove some special

00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:21,629
characters that you don't want to

00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:25,410
consider that just makes a few of the

00:14:21,629 --> 00:14:28,290
rules that we will see in a few moments

00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:31,139
easier we do tokenizing all that is

00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:33,749
basic standard and in the end we do a

00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:36,779
part-of-speech tagging everything can be

00:14:33,749 --> 00:14:38,939
done with out-of-the-box tools for the

00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:43,290
speech tagging Eustace then a Stanford

00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:46,319
post a girl with the STS sugs tax ID

00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:47,759
from from Stuttgart and the example I

00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:50,009
guess everyone seen something like this

00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:52,889
before there was a talk from trotting

00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:54,569
aslam yesterday you have sentence like

00:14:52,889 --> 00:14:57,509
Angela Merkel Swift amid wat na dena

00:14:54,569 --> 00:14:59,220
Putin in Moscow a gala as a proper name

00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:03,689
Merkel is the proper name through the

00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:07,350
finite verb and so on ok nothing magic

00:15:03,689 --> 00:15:10,319
in here next step is a chunking step or

00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:13,290
we also call it phrase detection we have

00:15:10,319 --> 00:15:18,119
a set of rules a regular grammar and we

00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:20,489
apply those this grammar to the text

00:15:18,119 --> 00:15:25,429
sentence and try to figure out actually

00:15:20,489 --> 00:15:25,429
what tokens together are

00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:33,060
could be combined to a to a phrase for

00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:36,149
instance I could say that nominal phrase

00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:38,700
for me is a sequence of proper names at

00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:41,790
least one preposition prepositional

00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:44,160
phrase and so on take the example here

00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:48,420
you come up with a representation of the

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:51,779
phrases like in the bottom of the figure

00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:53,130
of the page if you don't like this kind

00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:55,529
of representation you're more into

00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:57,540
drawings think of it as a syntax tree

00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:59,910
representation of a sentence the

00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,980
sentence consists of a nominal phrase a

00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:06,329
verbal phrase a prepositional phrase and

00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:08,339
so on this is also nothing to magic the

00:16:06,329 --> 00:16:09,779
only thing you have to come up with what

00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:12,089
are my phrases what is the set of

00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:16,019
grammar that is something you have to

00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:19,170
implement on your own third step we

00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:24,630
actually use these trees probably a

00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:26,700
partial trees to extract facts we have a

00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:28,620
self implemented extraction language

00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:32,040
with the goal to instil extract

00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:34,260
important keywords by using a set of

00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,140
rules for instance we have a rules we

00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:39,180
say okay we have a nominal phrase

00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,709
followed by a verbal phrase if we have

00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:43,199
something like that okay that is a match

00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:45,390
and from this match we want to keep

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,910
certain parts like we want to keep

00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:49,680
nominal phrase we want to keep the

00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:52,260
verbal phrase but from the verbal phrase

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:54,810
we actually keep the verb there the

00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:57,810
finite verb add the nominal phrase at

00:16:54,810 --> 00:17:00,269
the end of it so from our example Angela

00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:03,779
Merkel truth I Met Ball Vladimir Putin

00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:06,000
in Moscow what is left over as a fact by

00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:09,150
this rule is Aguila markets with letting

00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:13,559
me a poutine we apply all the rules we

00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:15,750
have to the syndics tree potentially we

00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:18,419
have a set of results we have to filter

00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:20,730
out what is the best result for us you

00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:22,980
can think of a lot of filters actually

00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:25,350
apply several of them one possible

00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:27,809
filter could be just the length of the

00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:31,110
result you get markets roof market with

00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:33,330
Putin is even better maybe you prefer

00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:35,970
the longer form market with Putin in

00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:38,410
Moscow maybe you don't because it's not

00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:41,560
the idea of summarizing what

00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:43,300
short summary and that is one filter you

00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:46,900
could come up with another idea would be

00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:48,580
coverage what is the web what is the

00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:52,060
rule of the largest coverage of my

00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:55,600
syntax tree and so on okay we got those

00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:58,480
facts and out of those facts in a last

00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,580
step we generate some reason actually we

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:04,000
do two things we generate normalized

00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:05,800
terms out of it and also we want to

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,230
generate a syntactically well-formed

00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:11,740
summary something we can present to the

00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:13,960
user as human readable result as a

00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:17,470
potential search query you can use on

00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:20,710
our website to get to the actual news

00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:22,870
for that summary the first thing the

00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:25,150
normalized term it's pretty simple we

00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:27,340
take the keywords be extracted in the

00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:29,290
last step we normalize them we

00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:33,690
concatenate them we put all this in a

00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:33,690
Linux I actually fall asleep off

00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:43,510
come on so in our case Angela Merkel to

00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,670
Vladimir Putin the normalized

00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:48,390
concatenated form that we actually store

00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:53,020
in the index would be mac-11 poutine and

00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:56,350
we also generate the well-formed summary

00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:58,450
that is pretty simple we take syntax

00:18:56,350 --> 00:19:02,200
tree and we remove actually all the

00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:04,300
parts of the sentence or of the syntax

00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:07,570
tree that we do not want to keep with

00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:09,490
our rules and from the example the scent

00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:12,190
extruder showed here what will be left

00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:14,530
over is in the end a summary and Gail

00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:17,080
immaculate with Vladimir Putin what is

00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:19,780
human readable what is descriptive what

00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:24,270
is a good result that we can present to

00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:27,370
our user so what are we doing with that

00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:31,540
I'm coming to the end we can use the

00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:33,820
normalized summary year for the

00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:37,030
significant term query just these are

00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:40,150
some examples that would show you what

00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:42,190
kind of normalized summary we would get

00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:44,680
out career-ending strike at these

00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:48,850
examples like two weeks ago so just in

00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:50,620
case you recognize the news and if we

00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:51,420
have something like this we can easily

00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,160
look up

00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:56,610
what is develop from summary display to

00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:59,520
the user and so on so be think we

00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:02,490
accomplished our mission so in the end

00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,650
to summarize it we found a way by using

00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:08,460
natural language processing to aggregate

00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:11,250
news to summarize news and also using

00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:13,470
elastic search we found out what are the

00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:15,420
significant news we can display this to

00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:19,560
the user is an actual example from our

00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:21,570
website there of course some problems

00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:24,270
still there it's an iterative process to

00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:25,740
actually get all these rules correct

00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:30,090
there are always examples that don't

00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:32,510
work and move that actually undone and

00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:40,470
there's only one thing left for me and

00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:45,510
that is come on it's on my laptop by the

00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:47,040
way and and that is to actually invite

00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:50,180
you come and see you that blue de

00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:53,480
does not feel reimplemented it its life

00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,480
