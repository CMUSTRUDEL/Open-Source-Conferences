Description: 
	Sorted lists of integers are commonly used in Lucene's implementation of inverted index. Those lists are often compressed in-memory as a trade-off between memory footprint and access speed and CPU utilization. Thus, encoding and, more important, decoding of these lists consumes significant CPU time. 

We can use a SIMD instructions available in modern commodity processors to boost integer decompression performance. Key obstacle here is that Java/HotSpot doesn't provide access to SIMD instructions. Calling a JNI method from Java is rather expensive comparing to a simple C function call. Fortunately, for cases when native method just perform some encoding/decoding on a byte array, HotSpot has a private interface (it will likely to become a more standard extension) which adds a minimum overhead to the native routine.
