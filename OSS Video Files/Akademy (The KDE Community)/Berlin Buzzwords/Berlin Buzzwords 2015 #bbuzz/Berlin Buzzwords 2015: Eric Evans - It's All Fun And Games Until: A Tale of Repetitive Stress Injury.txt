Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2015: Eric Evans - It's All Fun And Games Until: A Tale of Repetitive Stress Injury
Publication date: 2015-06-04
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2015 #bbuzz
Description: 
	I spent years ignoring ergonomics, operating under an arrogance that the health issues associated with long hours behind a keyboard were something that happened to others, and not Me. Unsurprisingly, I would learn the hard way that I was wrong.

Years of surgery, physical therapy, medication, and a healthier set of work habits have taught me the value of an ounce of prevention. In this presentation I relate a cautionary tale of mistakes made, consequences incurred, and the lessons learned along the way.

yeah I'm very happy to be here um this

00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:15,350
is kind of the highlight of my year

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,330
buzzwords is my favorite conference we

00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,859
were just I was just talking to Simon I

00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,750
was one of the people that stood up

00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:22,430
yesterday when Isabelle asked how many

00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:25,610
people had been at the first one I've

00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:28,430
been it at everyone since then I've

00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:30,619
actually spoken it ever every buzzword

00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:35,329
since then though this is my first

00:00:30,619 --> 00:00:37,280
keynote buzz words or otherwise so take

00:00:35,329 --> 00:00:42,319
solace in knowing if I screw this up no

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:44,120
one would be more upset than me and I do

00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:46,579
want to thank you all for showing up

00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:49,129
this morning I had a little trepidation

00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:51,229
of my own this is you maybe it's a bit

00:00:49,129 --> 00:00:55,729
off topic and I'll seem a little weird

00:00:51,229 --> 00:00:57,530
for a for a tech conference but I think

00:00:55,729 --> 00:00:59,989
it's you know it's pretty safe to say

00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:01,749
that you know we all spend a great deal

00:00:59,989 --> 00:01:03,739
of time in front of our computers and

00:01:01,749 --> 00:01:05,720
there are some health risks associated

00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:08,829
with that and I think we could we could

00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,659
do with raising the awareness a bit

00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:14,329
before I get started I do want to make

00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:17,030
it absolutely clear that I am NOT a

00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:19,340
doctor I'm not a medical professional of

00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:24,049
any kind I don't even play one on

00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:26,149
television I'm going to tell a story my

00:01:24,049 --> 00:01:27,859
story of the troubles I've had with

00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:31,119
repetitive stress injury and in doing so

00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:35,090
I kind of invariably have to talk about

00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:36,679
symptoms and diagnosis and treatment and

00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:38,929
maybe a little bit about workstation

00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:41,200
ergonomics but you shouldn't take any of

00:01:38,929 --> 00:01:45,229
that home with you as you know as as

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,609
information you should act on the only

00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:49,399
thing I would hope you you would take

00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:51,439
home with you is that you should go get

00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:56,600
medical advice and then and then follow

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:58,929
it so every story has a beginning I'm

00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,609
choosing to SAP mine in the year 2000

00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:03,020
it's a bit arbitrary it certainly

00:02:01,609 --> 00:02:08,090
doesn't represent when I first started

00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:09,350
using computers but prior to 2000 it

00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,470
would have been more or less as a

00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:16,460
secondary tool for work in school and as

00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:18,260
a hobby 2000s a nice epoch for me

00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:19,250
because it's when I got my my very first

00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:25,070
job at a

00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:28,490
tech startup 15 years is a long time in

00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:30,530
this industry and a lot has changed but

00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:32,420
i think you know what it what it means

00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:35,959
to work at a start-up is remain largely

00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:38,630
the same so just sort of you know set

00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:41,990
the scene you know we had a small group

00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:45,560
of small group of relatively young

00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:47,500
energetic people you know a group that

00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,790
was very much believed in the mission

00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,550
you know true believers would be a good

00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:55,070
way to describe us we had a bit of money

00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:56,480
but in those early days of a startup you

00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:58,580
know that's viewed as a runway and that

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,260
runway gets a bit shorter every day you

00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,790
have these really concrete sort of

00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,470
milestones you have to reach by a

00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:06,830
certain period of time before you can

00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:14,570
kind of move on before you become

00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:18,590
established this kind of fuels this

00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:20,660
sense of urgency this this need to get

00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:22,880
things done to do whatever it takes

00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:26,900
everybody wears multiple hats everyone's

00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:30,470
a basically on call it kind of results

00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:32,720
in this culture of heroics for me

00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:35,660
personally though that what overshadowed

00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,820
that was just the amount of fun I had it

00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:40,880
was it was kind of the right place at

00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:44,030
the right time for me I would

00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:45,590
characterize it as like the most the

00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:48,489
thing that stuck out to me the most was

00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:50,600
what they would let me do you know

00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:52,489
anywhere else you know the established

00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,410
company I would have been seen deemed as

00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:56,420
to junior or we're not having the right

00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:58,640
background for you know a good many of

00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:01,670
these projects but all I needed was a

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,230
can-do attitude and and they would let

00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,900
me you know that would let me work on

00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:08,840
things on top of that you know they let

00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:12,709
me do crazy out-of-the-box thinking so I

00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,510
just had so much fun I learned so much a

00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:16,040
typical day for me you know i would

00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:17,510
bounce out of the bed out of bed in the

00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,120
morning just super excited to get

00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:21,739
started which is a good way to be and i

00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,860
would show up you know strictly earlier

00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:27,020
than i needed too often before anyone

00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,510
else i would work long on interrupted

00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,700
hours those early days you know we had

00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:32,750
lunch catered in and so I didn't even

00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:34,160
need to suffer the interrupt

00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,560
chin to get something to eat I could

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,000
just drag a play back to my desk and I

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,500
would work into the evening and

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,070
oftentimes I would go home and I would

00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:46,750
work some more you know I worked through

00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:49,550
the weekend I would pull all-nighters I

00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,990
loved holidays holiday for me is when

00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:52,220
everyone else took a holiday because in

00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:55,910
the office was empty and I could just

00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:57,170
get a I could get so much done in it I'd

00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:59,120
like to think that I have a good work

00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:00,980
ethic but that's not what this was I

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,170
would have told you at the time I was a

00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:06,200
hacker this is what i did this is the

00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:07,670
thing as I thought about having this job

00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:09,770
all it really did was afford me the

00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:12,470
luxury of thinking about it you know

00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:14,480
full time without worrying about how I

00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:16,820
was going to put food on the table and

00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,980
all of this kind of fit in well with

00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,900
this you know this early stage of the

00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:21,890
startup this culture of heroics you just

00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:26,120
looked like I was you know really

00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:29,120
pulling for the team I think that

00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,340
initial initial super intense period of

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,890
a startup usually is pretty pretty fine

00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,630
I pretty short either you fail and you

00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:38,300
know let's let's admit it most startups

00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:39,770
do or you succeed and more resources

00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,450
become available and more people are

00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:45,350
hired and there's less pressure on that

00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:47,690
initial group around this time though is

00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:51,050
when we had that first big crash in tech

00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:52,610
and a bursting of the bubble and I think

00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,010
just being the first time this happened

00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:57,110
I think there was a lot of a lot of

00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:59,320
skepticism that it would ever recover

00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:02,840
and so while we were doing really well

00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:05,420
you know investor confidence was so far

00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:08,000
it was so down that it kind of cast

00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:09,770
doubt on our future so we did something

00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,470
very unusual for for such an early stage

00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:14,770
startup for such a young company we

00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:18,020
became profitable and we did it by just

00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:20,510
sheer hard work just sheer force of will

00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:23,570
we doubled down we did even more from

00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:27,170
less so two years on if anything it's

00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:29,270
just gotten more intense for me and the

00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:32,180
first few cracks started to show I

00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:34,760
started to get some pain in my in my

00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,830
hands and my wrist at my forearms I

00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,300
started to get some numbness and

00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,340
tingling in my fingers and this would

00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,920
have been in the fingers on the inside

00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:46,210
of my hand so the thumb index finger and

00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:51,440
maybe told lesser degree the ring finger

00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:53,630
occasionally from time to time I could

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,670
always correlate it to recent activity I

00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:58,510
could say well I just came off an

00:06:55,670 --> 00:07:00,920
all-nighter or I just put in a row

00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:03,770
particularly hard week to get something

00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,540
launched on time I could always

00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:09,050
correlate it with recent events and that

00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:11,840
unfortunately kind of fueled this denial

00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:17,180
that that it wasn't anything to worry

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:20,930
about that that you know that was just a

00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:24,650
you know simple a simple case of

00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:27,170
overwork or or strain you know that was

00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:28,550
fine I go home I take a nice long

00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:29,840
weekend or something stay away from the

00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:32,390
keyboard and I would feel better and

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:35,270
that reinforced this I don't really know

00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:38,000
what what I was thinking back then but I

00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:41,780
had this real sense of of I don't know

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,300
denial that I felt as if this didn't

00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:45,380
apply to me that you know repetitive

00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:47,690
stress injuries were something that

00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,950
happened to other people and that this

00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,690
wasn't something I needed to worry about

00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:54,350
her at least not right now it just it

00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:56,150
just couldn't make it a priority and so

00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:57,650
this sort of episodic major just helped

00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,390
me kind of dismiss it as well that's

00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:02,240
nothing obviously I feel better it must

00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:04,760
be okay but another year down the road

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,850
and the pain is getting a little worse

00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:10,460
so is the numbness and tingling it's now

00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:12,380
joined by neck pain shoulder pain back

00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:15,980
pain I'm getting some pretty bad

00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:17,840
headaches and it's becoming often it's

00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:20,870
no longer you know episodic I can no

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,370
longer correlate it to any given

00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:27,170
activity it's actually becoming kind of

00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:29,900
constant and I'm kind of ashamed to say

00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:31,250
that that what really got me what made

00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,320
me decide to go to go see a doctor

00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:36,890
wasn't out of fear what I was doing to

00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,390
my body it was that it was getting in

00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:41,479
the way of things it wasn't you know it

00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:44,150
was interfering with my was my output

00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45,500
and for some reason I still thought I

00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,940
would go to the doctor and everything

00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,960
would just be you know it would just be

00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:53,000
something simple so I went to see my

00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:56,900
primary care physician the doctor I see

00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,800
for you know most things and I was right

00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,810
it was a very short visit

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,790
she wanted to wanted to know what the

00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:05,820
symptoms were she made note of what I

00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:08,160
did for a living and promptly referred

00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:10,339
me to an orthopedic hand surgeon who

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,899
specializes in occupational injuries

00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:15,750
that's not a diagnosis but it made it

00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:17,610
pretty obvious what she was thinking so

00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,860
I I called to set up an appointment with

00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:22,350
this hand surgeon and they have a few

00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,300
questions you know like what do you do

00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,920
for living what are your symptoms and

00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,089
they wouldn't even see me they wouldn't

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,450
even put me on the calendar until I

00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:33,209
first got a nerve conduction study from

00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:35,700
a neurologist now nerve conduction study

00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:37,769
is a diagnostic procedure that's used to

00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,360
determine whether or not you have carpal

00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:41,610
tunnel syndrome which is sort of the

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,350
poster child for for repetitive stress

00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:45,360
injuries so I still didn't have a

00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:51,450
diagnosis but it was pretty obvious what

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:54,120
they were thinking before I explain what

00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:56,339
the nerve conduction study is let me

00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:00,839
tell another story take a small side I

00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:05,310
promise to circle back around I spent

00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:08,190
the latter years of my teens living in

00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:09,420
the city of El Paso Texas so for those

00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:12,000
of you who are not familiar with US

00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:16,170
geography which i assume is everyone

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,200
here from the US El Paso is a city in

00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:22,380
West Texas it's a very very remote out

00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,230
in the middle of the desert if you think

00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:27,690
is sort of stereotypical idea of of a

00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:30,540
desert in the u.s. Southwest you know

00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:34,380
cactuses sagebrush tumbleweeds nothing

00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:36,660
but sand that's it exactly but it is a

00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:38,640
border community so if you look at El

00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,140
Paso from the air it looks like this is

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,610
one big city with a river running

00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,709
through the middle of it when in fact

00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:46,320
everything north of that river is the

00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:48,029
u.s. it's El Paso and every everything

00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,560
south of that river is the city of wat

00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:54,029
is in Mexico so everything north of that

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,649
river has a drinking age of 21

00:10:54,029 --> 00:11:01,310
everything's South 18 so it follows if

00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:05,399
you're a teenager living in in El Paso

00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:06,630
and it's hot and it's boring and all you

00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:08,370
have to do is walk across the bridge

00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:10,720
into what is to buy a beer like everyone

00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:12,459
else that's what you're going to do

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,110
and it wasn't just me thousands of

00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:17,740
american teenagers flocked there every

00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:20,980
friday and saturday night making that

00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:22,629
place very very strange it was strange I

00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,519
think it was strange precisely because

00:11:22,629 --> 00:11:28,420
it was filled with hammered American

00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:31,540
teenagers they had this guy who would go

00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:36,160
around from bar to bar club to club with

00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:38,500
this device called caja de tokus which i

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:43,199
think translates to something like box

00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,199
of shocks her box of electrical shocks

00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,350
this is what a google image search says

00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:49,149
this looks like that's not what I

00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:51,939
remember this site this thing looks very

00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:54,160
I don't know manufactured what I

00:11:51,939 --> 00:11:55,569
remember looked like it was cobbled

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,759
together out of bits and pieces of

00:11:55,569 --> 00:12:00,160
household appliances I distinctly

00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:02,889
remember a bear transformer kind of

00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,910
haphazardly screwed a piece of scrap

00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:08,709
plywood with just bare wires everywhere

00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:11,949
not the sort of thing that you know

00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:13,660
synonymous was safety but this man would

00:12:11,949 --> 00:12:17,139
set up at a booth or a table and people

00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:20,889
would line up to sit opposite of him and

00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:22,660
crucially pay him money like a dollar or

00:12:20,889 --> 00:12:24,490
something so that they could pick up

00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:28,540
these electrodes and let the man shock

00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:30,189
them I would love to tell you what the

00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,500
point of this is what you know what this

00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:35,800
is all about the truth is I have no idea

00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,809
I used to think it was maybe you know

00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,850
like some contest because the man would

00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:42,069
turn the knob up as this this went

00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:44,079
through and of course they would rise

00:12:42,069 --> 00:12:47,170
and twist and twitch and it was just

00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,970
this grotesque spectacle then he would

00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:51,370
announce the number at the end and and

00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:52,600
everyone would cheer but they cheered no

00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,980
matter what they cheered no matter what

00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:56,500
the number was and nobody seemed to be

00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:59,800
keeping track of it so I really don't

00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:02,920
think it was a contest now to put this

00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:06,009
in further context you know I'm I'm

00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:09,250
let's say 18 18 years of age and like

00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:11,889
most males of our species I have peaked

00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:15,540
I have reached my peak by that i mean

00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:15,540
i'm at peak stupidity

00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:22,470
at no point prior in my life or no point

00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:26,620
sense have I been more stupid than I was

00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:29,380
right then and on top of this I'm

00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:32,980
drinking alcohol makes everybody stupid

00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:35,410
so it's it's compounded stupidity if

00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:37,209
there was ever a window of time ever a

00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:40,269
period when you could convince me to do

00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:44,860
something heinous ly stupid this was it

00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:46,720
and many people succeeded but I never

00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:49,810
once participated in this this whole

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,420
ritual of the caja de tokus in fact i

00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:55,810
SAT back and sort of you know righteous

00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:57,190
condemnation you shaking my head and

00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:59,199
it's stuck with me all of these years

00:13:57,190 --> 00:14:01,980
it's for me it's kind of rule number one

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:06,850
it's you know you do not pay someone to

00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:10,930
electrocute you everything after that's

00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:13,720
optional so what does this have to do

00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:16,800
with the nerve conduction study it's the

00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:19,810
same thing it's exactly the same thing

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:24,160
it's really it's right in the name nerve

00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:26,380
conduction the nerves are yours thus you

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:30,279
are the conductor and what we are

00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:34,360
conducting is electricity it's all

00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:36,040
wrapped up in a much tidier package if

00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:38,680
you look at this picture you know we can

00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,300
see the sharps container and the gloves

00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:44,019
dispensers mounted to the wall behind

00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:45,819
our patient this gentleman here in the

00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:49,089
foreground he appears to be sitting on

00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:50,980
an exam table this woman is clearly the

00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:52,660
neurologist and she's got her scrubs on

00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:54,519
she looks very professional she looks

00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,589
you know like a medical professional

00:14:54,519 --> 00:15:00,190
even the equipment looks a little bit

00:14:56,589 --> 00:15:02,019
better what we can see of it it's a it's

00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:05,680
attached to a laptop computer so it's

00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:07,060
got to be legit but make no mystery

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,760
about it this guy's about to get popped

00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:11,410
and when he does he's probably going to

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,260
come flying up off this table when he

00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:16,810
lands and his heart is racing and his

00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:18,430
breathing a shallow and rapid I suspect

00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:21,279
he'll be contemplating the stupidity

00:15:18,430 --> 00:15:24,279
that that led him to directly or

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,190
indirectly be you know paying this woman

00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:28,550
to

00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:30,680
camera but there is a method to this

00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:32,000
madness and I think it helps to

00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:37,820
understand what carpal tunnel syndrome

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:40,130
is so the carpal tunnel is this this

00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:42,080
area here at the base of your palm it's

00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:44,510
like a very narrow little opening

00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:46,070
through which all of the tendons and the

00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:48,020
the nerves and the blood vessels

00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:50,180
traverse and it's all everything's kind

00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:55,250
of held in place with this carpal

00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:57,770
ligament through repetitive motion of

00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:59,740
your of your fingers in your hand the

00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:02,750
repetitive motion of these these tendons

00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:04,820
this fluid-filled sheath which is shown

00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:08,660
here in the dark blue can become

00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:10,730
inflamed and you know it swells and

00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:13,160
makes that that already compact area

00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:14,480
much more compact and and you know your

00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,850
builds pressure within there and that

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:20,030
can impinge the blood flow and can

00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:21,740
impinge the nerves the body is very

00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:23,270
flexible and you know of course you can

00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,550
heal from this you will heal from this

00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:27,290
but in doing so little scar tissues

00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:29,690
formed and that you know it's formed

00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:31,160
within that carpal tunnel and so it

00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,420
makes makes it a little tighter and

00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:36,890
makes it a little easier for that to

00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:38,330
happen you know subsequently you know

00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:40,100
eventually you have so much scar tissue

00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,810
in there that it's it's very difficult

00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,490
for that information inflammation to go

00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:46,070
down and you know it just becomes sort

00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:47,540
of the new normal so the the nerve

00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:49,250
conduction study is you know it's

00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:51,050
transmitting an electrical current down

00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,580
your arm measuring the you know the

00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:56,660
response or the output at your fingers

00:16:52,580 --> 00:17:00,200
to look for that that impingement of the

00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:02,540
nerve in my case the median nerve would

00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:07,250
explain the numbness in the fingers on

00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:10,100
the inside of my hand so my nerve

00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:11,930
conduction study resulted in a diagnosis

00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:13,189
of carpal tunnel syndrome which I guess

00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:16,850
at this point was not terribly

00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:19,880
surprising and with this diagnosis I was

00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:22,310
able to to finally go see this this hand

00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,699
surgeon there were a few things that

00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:27,410
were surprising in that initial visit

00:17:24,699 --> 00:17:29,750
perhaps first and foremost was even

00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:32,300
though he is a hand surgeon the majority

00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:35,990
of what he does is an attempt to avoid

00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:37,820
hand surgery to address the root causes

00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,809
and see if we can't get you better

00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,360
without it with

00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:46,070
out surgery the surgery is a sort of

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:47,720
weapon of last resort another of the

00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,970
more surprising things that came out of

00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,309
that visit is I never mentioned to him

00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:55,639
any of those other symptoms the the

00:17:52,309 --> 00:17:57,679
headache backaches neck pain shoulder

00:17:55,639 --> 00:18:00,830
pain never never brought any of that up

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:03,230
and yet he began talking about it as if

00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:06,470
it was you know just a matter of fact as

00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:07,940
if as if he had known all along and this

00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:11,950
is I guess when I kind of realized that

00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:14,269
I was not a unique and special snowflake

00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:19,999
he explained that you know these that

00:18:14,269 --> 00:18:22,249
essentially these these behaviors this

00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:24,470
activity and you know particularly when

00:18:22,249 --> 00:18:27,919
you're not not adhering to the correct

00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:29,629
posture and ergonomics it results in

00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,669
some very little fairly standard set of

00:18:29,629 --> 00:18:35,179
symptoms and injuries and typically it's

00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:37,100
more than just you know you know pain in

00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:38,869
your hands the body is a system

00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,110
everything is connected and so generally

00:18:38,869 --> 00:18:46,309
this sort of abuse and stress and strain

00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:48,789
affects many parts of your body he set

00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:52,129
in motion a number of things that day

00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:54,919
the first of which was the work site

00:18:52,129 --> 00:18:58,100
evaluation so what this is is you have a

00:18:54,919 --> 00:19:01,100
physical therapist who also has a

00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:03,710
specialty in occupational injuries comes

00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:06,080
out to wherever it is you work kind of

00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:08,090
sits off to the side watch as you do

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,769
your thing take some notes and then

00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:12,399
pulls you pulls you off to the side and

00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:15,889
tells you what it is you're doing wrong

00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:18,559
most importantly why these wrong things

00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:22,190
are causing you pain you know creating

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:23,960
injuries they they tell you what it is

00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:26,360
you should be doing they give you a set

00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,519
of good behaviors some stretching

00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,590
exercises stressing the importance of

00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:32,629
breaks and they help you set up your

00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:34,269
workstation so you know the height of

00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:36,679
everything the angle of everything

00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:38,779
relationship of all of the pieces and

00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:40,909
again most importantly with explanations

00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:45,379
as to why this is good or why this is

00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:48,350
better I was given physical therapy I

00:19:45,379 --> 00:19:50,179
think this was something like 2-3 times

00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:52,039
a week for something like four to six

00:19:50,179 --> 00:19:52,580
weeks there were a variety of things

00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:54,559
done and

00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,960
some of which I just to this day I don't

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,490
really understand ultrasound therapies

00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,870
we're supposed to have some impact on

00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,970
the nerves but I never really quite

00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:04,159
interested why there was a fair amount

00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:06,440
of like what seemed like massage therapy

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,210
and I think that was about breaking up

00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,220
some of the scar tissue in that in that

00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:12,260
region and loosening loosening up the

00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:18,019
tissues there's also a lot of strength

00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:21,740
training a lot of resistance training I

00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:25,220
also started diagnostic injections man

00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:27,649
these things are fun it's not an

00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:29,299
intravenous injection is steroids they

00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:32,960
put it right into that carpal tunnel

00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:34,610
area when you look at the injection you

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,409
look at the volume of fluid and you're

00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:38,630
thinking you know conservation of mass I

00:20:36,409 --> 00:20:43,669
don't think that's going to all fit in

00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:45,049
there when he starts pressing you know

00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:46,820
pressing on the plunger and for some

00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:48,950
reason he's gotta push really hard you

00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:50,389
know he's got he's got to bear down into

00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:53,720
it then it really feels like it's not

00:20:50,389 --> 00:20:55,610
going to fit all in there the

00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:57,289
expectation is this is this may make you

00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:59,720
feel better in the days and weeks to

00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:03,139
come but the intention is not to make

00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,789
you feel better for the sake of it he

00:21:03,139 --> 00:21:08,960
puts this injection in a different place

00:21:04,789 --> 00:21:12,710
each time and then asks you to you know

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,940
to detail take detailed notes report

00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:16,399
back to him will you know what relief

00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,690
you had so he can kind of build up a map

00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:19,549
of what's going on inside your hand

00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:22,279
based on what you know what areas give

00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:25,940
you relief there's also a diminishing

00:21:22,279 --> 00:21:27,649
return to these injections so every

00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,539
subsequent injection you know the dose

00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:33,049
gets a little bigger to compensate for

00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:35,110
this and yeah you thought it was bad the

00:21:33,049 --> 00:21:37,789
first time over the last time you know

00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:43,100
my hand was just black and blue was

00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:48,529
really bad yeah good times I also

00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:50,600
started taking anti-inflammatories we

00:21:48,529 --> 00:21:53,000
tried a number of different things ended

00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,830
up settling on nsaids like you'd buy

00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:58,010
over-the-counter naproxen or ibuprofen

00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:59,960
although in significantly higher doses

00:21:58,010 --> 00:22:02,899
than what the bottle recommends

00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:05,210
prescription level doses and this was

00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:06,350
all that you know every day several

00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:10,010
times a day for

00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:12,080
weeks and months probably the least

00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:13,730
surprising thing is I was sent home with

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,230
splints I've already been thinking about

00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:19,190
how I was going to explain that fashion

00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:21,020
choice but it was my doctor's opinion

00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:22,730
that that there was little value in

00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,049
wearing these around during the day and

00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:26,530
while you work so long as you're

00:22:24,049 --> 00:22:29,330
maintaining the right you know

00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:30,799
positioning in posture he just wanted me

00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:33,440
to where I'm at night to keep from

00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:38,059
sleeping on them you know impinging that

00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:40,070
nerve further at night so I followed all

00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:41,960
the directions did everything that was

00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:45,190
asked of me by this point I'm taking it

00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:47,210
fully seriously I no longer believe that

00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:48,590
that this is not you know this is

00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:51,650
something I don't need to worry about it

00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:54,530
I do in fact believe at this point that

00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:59,200
it affects me as well and so a year

00:22:54,530 --> 00:23:02,210
later by 2004 I was doing much better

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,070
the carpal tunnel syndrome in my right

00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:05,809
hand was significantly worse than my

00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:07,159
left but have been you know in my left

00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:09,080
it had reached a point where I would

00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:11,770
call it you know manageable it was good

00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,780
if I if I did what I was supposed to

00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:17,690
headaches backaches neck pain all that's

00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:20,000
pretty much gone at this point and the

00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:22,460
right hand the worst of the two hands is

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,900
much improved but not not not fully

00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,580
better still a lot of numbness and

00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:29,480
tingling and you don't want to let that

00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:31,299
go unchecked because that can result in

00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:35,110
nerve damage and the nerve damage

00:23:31,299 --> 00:23:37,010
results in some pretty debilitating

00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:41,380
disfigurements of the hand so you

00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:43,880
definitely gotta stay on top of that so

00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:46,490
at this point we elected to have surgery

00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:49,640
surgery on the right hand the surgery

00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:53,809
for this is actually remarkably simple

00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:55,580
they just sever that transverse carpal

00:23:53,809 --> 00:23:57,799
ligament that band that kind of holds

00:23:55,580 --> 00:24:00,289
everything in place they make like a

00:23:57,799 --> 00:24:02,450
zigzag incision and then the expectation

00:24:00,289 --> 00:24:04,030
is it'll heal a little longer than and

00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:06,669
what it was to begin with and and

00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:09,230
relieve some of that pressure in there

00:24:06,669 --> 00:24:10,940
there came with some restrictions after

00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:12,980
the surgery you know limits on how much

00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:15,309
I could lift and you know how much

00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:17,960
gripping of things I could do and stuff

00:24:15,309 --> 00:24:19,940
ironically the one thing I could do when

00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,190
I went home and I did

00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,889
sit in front of the keyboard and type as

00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:26,029
long as I could deal with the thick

00:24:23,889 --> 00:24:29,980
surgical dressing I could go home and

00:24:26,029 --> 00:24:32,179
type I thought that was very strange

00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:35,029
after the surgery I had more physical

00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:37,850
therapy this seemed more geared geared

00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:39,769
towards a recovery from the surgery than

00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:45,639
the first bit so less of that resistance

00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:48,019
training so then fast forward to 2011

00:24:45,639 --> 00:24:50,179
surgery worked pretty good my right hand

00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:52,340
is now my good hand everything's good

00:24:50,179 --> 00:24:55,250
there everything everything else is

00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:57,110
essentially manageable at this point but

00:24:55,250 --> 00:25:00,200
in 2011 I started to have some more

00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:01,759
numbness and tingling in my fingers this

00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,980
time it's some of the fingers on the

00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:09,350
outside of my hands though so the pinky

00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:11,360
the ring finger I go back to the doctor

00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:15,259
right away again I no longer think that

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,590
the that I can avoid this you know that

00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:19,970
I did it that it doesn't apply to me and

00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:24,679
I get a diagnosis of cubital tunnel

00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:27,409
syndrome kind of messes up the whole

00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:29,899
acronym cts you never know cts there's

00:25:27,409 --> 00:25:31,759
like two of them cubital tunnel syndrome

00:25:29,899 --> 00:25:33,470
though is an impingement of a different

00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:35,120
nerve it's an impingement of the ulnar

00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:37,340
nerve which explains the different

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:41,299
fingers going numb and it's an

00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:44,539
impingement at the elbow how I got this

00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:47,539
is you know quite possibly is it was a

00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:50,059
result of some some you know some damage

00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:52,399
already done prior to this and I was

00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:55,129
reminded by my doctor that you know

00:25:52,399 --> 00:25:56,419
that's that the abuse that had led up to

00:25:55,129 --> 00:25:58,340
me being treated for carpal tunnel

00:25:56,419 --> 00:26:01,220
syndrome probably did it did other

00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:04,309
damage as well but I had also started to

00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:06,919
get quite lazy and lacks on my organ ah

00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:08,509
miix you know in that window sense and

00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:11,450
one of the things I had done is started

00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:14,269
to have the the arm rests on my chair

00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:16,340
creep upward to the point where as i was

00:26:14,269 --> 00:26:18,259
typing I had my weight you know I had

00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:20,240
the weight of my arms down on top of the

00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:24,110
of the armrest I was applying pressure

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,549
and that's kind of notorious for this so

00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:28,009
in addition to getting my organ aam

00:26:25,549 --> 00:26:31,279
Ock's fixed getting back on track with

00:26:28,009 --> 00:26:33,460
that I was given splints again to wear

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:36,170
again at night

00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:38,270
prevent you from sleeping with your your

00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:42,710
elbows bent and impinging the nerve

00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:44,690
while you sleep the options for surgery

00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:50,570
for this are are much more limited

00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:51,800
they're less less lower success rate

00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:54,200
with the surgery it's more complicated

00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:56,929
more invasive takes longer to recover

00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:00,290
from so you have to be pretty bad to get

00:26:56,929 --> 00:27:01,490
surgery for this one I still kind of

00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:02,900
have a problem with this from time to

00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:04,190
time I'll get the numbness and tingling

00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:06,380
and I'll have to remember to put my

00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:09,470
splint son and I sleep with my arms

00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:12,410
straight so then fast forward to earlier

00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:15,650
this year I started to get some pain

00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:17,990
again this time in my on the outer

00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:21,140
portion of my forearm round where it

00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:23,270
connects to the elbow I went to the

00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:25,460
doctor and I get this diagnosis that

00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:27,530
camp an ass but they call it Mouse elbow

00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:28,670
or tennis elbow there's actually a lot

00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:31,040
of activities that are really

00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:34,610
susceptible to this carpenters get it

00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:36,320
from swinging a hammer and of course you

00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:37,940
know those of us who sit behind a

00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:41,150
keyboard all day can get it from from

00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:43,820
using the mouse it's sort of a strain on

00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:48,410
this tendon that connects the extensor

00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:51,320
muscles and forearm to the elbow how I

00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:52,550
got this is probably again it may have

00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:57,380
been something I had been courting for

00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:59,840
years I had also again started to become

00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:02,510
slack in the intervening years and with

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,100
respect to the height and distance of

00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:06,140
where the mouse was relative to the

00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:08,140
keyboard and you know palm rests and arm

00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:10,400
rests I was I was getting a little

00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:12,290
playing it a little fast and loose again

00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:16,040
I was also killing a lot of zombies

00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:17,960
around this time you know in addition to

00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:19,580
my daily workload I you know I was

00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,520
killing a fair amount of zombies and of

00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:24,890
course that requires a little extra so

00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:27,500
in addition to getting my my ergonomics

00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:31,640
back on track and killing a few few less

00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:34,160
zombies I started taking some

00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:36,320
anti-inflammatories again and I was

00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:38,690
given this brace another the fashion

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:41,090
choice I had to explain to people sort

00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:42,650
of a band with a little plastic nodule

00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:44,480
that sits over that area I think the

00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:47,800
intent of which is to kind of give you

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,800
some additional support

00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:55,610
so then fast forward today to today as

00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:57,409
of today I would say I'm you know more

00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:59,679
or less healthy I feel like I've never

00:28:57,409 --> 00:29:01,669
quite been the same since you know since

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:05,450
since this got to the point that I had

00:29:01,669 --> 00:29:06,980
to go to the doctor the first time even

00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:08,600
more more so than what I mentioned

00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:11,210
during the timeline I have kind of you

00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:14,630
know from quite often sort of gotten

00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:17,630
lakhs on the on the you know I'm taking

00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:19,250
breaks on the stretching exercises or

00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:21,769
you know kind of allowed my ergonomics

00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:24,169
to to go out outside of you know

00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:26,389
protocol and I'm usually reminded with

00:29:24,169 --> 00:29:28,539
some some old pain and then I and I get

00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:30,889
back on track and then everything's fine

00:29:28,539 --> 00:29:33,380
feels like it's just kind of under the

00:29:30,889 --> 00:29:37,010
surface and I have been able to maintain

00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:39,500
a pretty good pretty good pace you know

00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:40,909
I work a good number of hours a fair

00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:44,240
number of hours though I do know my

00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:46,610
limitations these days I'm able to put

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,470
in a very full week and do so relatively

00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:49,669
comfortable but I have to you know I

00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:52,399
really have to kind of stay on top of

00:29:49,669 --> 00:29:57,740
things I don't seem to have much wiggle

00:29:52,399 --> 00:30:00,019
room anymore so let's let's step back a

00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:04,159
little bit take some retrospective see

00:30:00,019 --> 00:30:06,169
what we can learn from all of this the

00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,809
main thing for me like the main takeaway

00:30:06,169 --> 00:30:11,840
of everything that I had you know that

00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:14,809
every bit of assistance i got from from

00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:16,880
medicine the one thing that you know

00:30:14,809 --> 00:30:19,639
hands down I wouldn't trade away was

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,380
that work site evaluation this is

00:30:19,639 --> 00:30:26,690
essentially just you know a couple of

00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:33,289
hours of my time nothing was done to me

00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:36,110
it was entirely knowledge transfer but I

00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:39,110
got more relief in just you know in just

00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:41,960
the the subsequent few days than any

00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:44,929
other single you know treatment or or

00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:47,899
procedure you know ever gave and the one

00:30:44,929 --> 00:30:49,730
thing I sort of credit with allowing me

00:30:47,899 --> 00:30:52,580
to continue to follow my passions all

00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:54,049
these years you know are these you know

00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:56,600
is essentially what I had what I learned

00:30:54,049 --> 00:30:59,129
and when I fall off the wagon when I

00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:01,210
when I fail to

00:30:59,129 --> 00:31:02,799
to follow this it's you know it's

00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:09,489
returning to this the set of protocols

00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:11,889
that puts me back on track the main

00:31:09,489 --> 00:31:13,809
takeaway I got from this you know again

00:31:11,889 --> 00:31:16,119
don't go home and practice ergonomics

00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:17,799
based on anything you heard here but the

00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:19,149
thing I found that you know that kind of

00:31:17,799 --> 00:31:21,669
resonated with everything that they

00:31:19,149 --> 00:31:23,549
taught me was this kind of this idea of

00:31:21,669 --> 00:31:26,769
you know remaining balance tour

00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:28,269
anatomically neutral when you work you

00:31:26,769 --> 00:31:30,309
know we're kind of vertical structures

00:31:28,269 --> 00:31:32,019
you know you know we're we're best

00:31:30,309 --> 00:31:34,090
adapted to supporting our own weight and

00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:37,779
enormous stresses you know in the

00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:39,729
vertical and so when we when we you know

00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:41,950
leave that that vertical when we're

00:31:39,729 --> 00:31:43,889
leaning you know forward or backward

00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:46,210
which is which seems very very common

00:31:43,889 --> 00:31:47,529
and we have to hold ourselves in that

00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:54,099
position our weight is distributed

00:31:47,529 --> 00:31:55,690
poorly you know days or you know you

00:31:54,099 --> 00:31:57,549
know occasionally this isn't an issue

00:31:55,690 --> 00:32:00,190
but when it's you know week after week

00:31:57,549 --> 00:32:04,029
month after month it can really take his

00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:06,519
toll the the strength training that I

00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:09,519
that I mentioned in the physical therapy

00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:11,919
was precisely to deal with this it was

00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:15,399
very targeted very focused you know at

00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:17,619
it was meant to to develop the muscles

00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:19,059
that had been that would counteract or

00:32:17,619 --> 00:32:21,309
balance out the muscles that i had

00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:24,159
developed from you know sitting hunched

00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:27,309
over for example for years on end to

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:30,190
restore that kind of balance you know

00:32:27,309 --> 00:32:34,479
that this this theme of anatomically

00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:38,799
neutral you know pertains to the the you

00:32:34,479 --> 00:32:41,440
know the rather common wisdom of keeping

00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:43,239
your wrist straight when you type if you

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,679
go back to that diagram of the hand that

00:32:43,239 --> 00:32:47,889
carpal tunnel is right there at the base

00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:50,200
of the palm if you if you bend your

00:32:47,889 --> 00:32:51,820
wrist while you're typing your including

00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:54,519
that opening it's like pinching a garden

00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:56,200
hose you know everything needs to move

00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:57,849
freely through there and you're creating

00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,879
a lot of additional pressure so you make

00:32:57,849 --> 00:33:03,879
that that irritation and the subsequent

00:33:00,879 --> 00:33:05,499
formation of scar tissue all the more

00:33:03,879 --> 00:33:08,080
likely when you type with your wrist

00:33:05,499 --> 00:33:10,720
bent you know straight is kind of the

00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,900
anatomical anatomically neutral position

00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:16,010
for that where every

00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:18,920
moves freely me I committed every sin in

00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:21,680
the book and I was never upright never

00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:23,960
balance never anatomically neutral and I

00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:27,380
was always leaning on one arm rest or

00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:33,020
you know leaned back or lean forward I

00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:36,500
mean this is this is like very this is

00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:37,910
very common with a laptop you could

00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,290
probably look around and see a few

00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:41,000
people staring down at the screens now

00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:43,340
and they're all hunched over let's see

00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,850
see a few people like suddenly went up

00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:48,830
right when I said that yeah I mean with

00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:50,480
the laptop with the screen fixed to the

00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:53,030
you know to the keyboard like that it's

00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:57,290
very hard not to hunch over it like I

00:33:53,030 --> 00:34:00,380
like it's your precious and I don't know

00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:02,000
for me even now the other the more

00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,770
intensely I get into whatever it is I'm

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,240
doing for some reason the closer i need

00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:07,010
to get my face to that screen and the

00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:09,890
more I'm hunched over I have to remember

00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:12,200
not to do that I also laughed at this

00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:14,149
one because I used to do this a lot

00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:17,120
whenever I wasn't you know super intense

00:34:14,149 --> 00:34:19,040
Deepak mode hovered over the screen I

00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:20,870
was doing in this he's not doing it

00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,280
right though the right way is to get

00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:25,880
your feet kicked up on an overturned

00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:27,290
trash bin or a sub woofer and then you

00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:34,070
can scoot all the way in toward the

00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:35,419
desks like right up in your armpits so

00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:38,570
this is kind of the conventional wisdom

00:34:35,419 --> 00:34:40,669
and again you know it's just to

00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:43,280
demonstrate this idea of you know of

00:34:40,669 --> 00:34:45,020
everything being balanced and neutral

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,179
you know if you look at this the monitor

00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:49,460
is such a height that that she doesn't

00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:51,409
have to hold you know hold her head down

00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:53,120
or up you know she can she can have her

00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:56,270
head balanced on her neck you know a

00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:58,150
nice vertical structure that's well well

00:34:56,270 --> 00:35:00,020
suited for supporting the weight and

00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:03,020
just looked straight forward at the

00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:04,400
screen you know her torso is upright so

00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:06,710
that way it is all distributed in the

00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,890
vertical got a little lumbar support

00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:11,930
their legs bent at a 90 knees bent at a

00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:12,950
90 feet flat on the floor so everything

00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:16,280
is you know the weight is evenly

00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:18,080
distributed as possible her arms dangles

00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,850
straight down at her sides and then with

00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,230
the elbows bent at a 90 and her wrists

00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:24,880
straight the keyboard is right there

00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:26,769
it's all it's all meant you know 22

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,990
distribute their weight evenly and

00:35:26,769 --> 00:35:31,599
across you know the structures of our

00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:33,869
body that are most adapted to to

00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,220
supporting them and just you know as

00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:43,150
anatomically neutral as you could you

00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:45,700
could be so over the years I you know

00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:47,950
you know I've really have been really

00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:49,720
elevated this work site evaluation you

00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:51,849
know to you know it's to being the thing

00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:54,480
you know the thing I credit with being

00:35:51,849 --> 00:36:00,160
able to continue to follow my passions

00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:01,299
through the intervening years but I more

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,869
recently believe that I've been looking

00:36:01,299 --> 00:36:06,609
at this this wrong when I got my work

00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:09,160
site evaluation it's set quite a

00:36:06,609 --> 00:36:12,279
precedent you know I'm even know where I

00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:14,859
was working no one had ever seen that

00:36:12,279 --> 00:36:19,150
before and you know satna you know big

00:36:14,859 --> 00:36:20,470
open area kind of war room style and and

00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:22,930
so it was kind of unavoidable that

00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:25,000
everybody you know everybody saw this

00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:27,369
going on and they were very curious and

00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,369
you know tried very hard to not be

00:36:27,369 --> 00:36:33,430
obvious about staring and it was kind of

00:36:30,369 --> 00:36:36,460
embarrassing i guess but our human

00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:38,230
resource manager also noticed this and

00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:40,329
she pulled aside the the physical

00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:42,369
therapist and got contact information

00:36:40,329 --> 00:36:45,099
and arranged for everybody to get one of

00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:48,160
these worksite evaluations if they if

00:36:45,099 --> 00:36:50,259
they wanted I knew that what I didn't

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:53,109
know was how many people actually took

00:36:50,259 --> 00:36:54,700
them up on that in particular how many

00:36:53,109 --> 00:36:56,500
people who took them up on that were

00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:58,420
just people who were who were sitting

00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,730
around me and wondering what was going

00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:03,849
on that day it's only been in recent

00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:05,740
years you know when I meet up with a the

00:37:03,849 --> 00:37:07,690
past coworker at a conference or

00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:09,849
something over beers you know we start

00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:13,839
reminiscing about the old days all those

00:37:09,849 --> 00:37:15,579
old people tend to do and this subject

00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:17,920
will come up I remember when you had

00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:20,289
your work site evaluation and that

00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,660
prompted me to get one of my own and and

00:37:20,289 --> 00:37:24,880
then they go on to in the same way I do

00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:26,500
to credit it with keeping them healthy

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,650
and allowing them to follow their

00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:32,460
passions all these years the difference

00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:35,470
though is that for them it was proactive

00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:37,390
for me it was reactive and obviously it

00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:38,849
is so much better to avoid getting these

00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:41,320
kinds of

00:37:38,849 --> 00:37:44,830
than it is to deal with them after the

00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:47,349
fact and I took a little solace in

00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:49,630
knowing you know that that at least my

00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:52,599
bad example my bad experiences may have

00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:55,839
helped some others avoid those the same

00:37:52,599 --> 00:37:58,510
some of those same mistakes that's kind

00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:02,320
of know the genesis of this talk so why

00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:04,060
I wanted to come do it I think that

00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,980
attitude that this is you know this

00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:08,710
isn't something that we need to worry

00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:10,630
about it's something that doesn't

00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:16,030
pertain to us I think it's a far more

00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:18,010
common then we all like to admit and you

00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:19,660
know it's it's really important you know

00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:21,750
your health is important if you were to

00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:23,950
continue to do this for decades on end

00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:26,820
it's important that you be healthy

00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:28,810
you're able to do it comfortably so

00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:30,220
again if you take anything away from

00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:32,950
this I would I would hope that it would

00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:34,210
be when you go home whatever form this

00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:36,250
takes you know whether they call it a

00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:41,260
work site evaluation or or something

00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:43,420
else find an expert and follow their

00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:48,540
advice because I think you it would

00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:48,540
