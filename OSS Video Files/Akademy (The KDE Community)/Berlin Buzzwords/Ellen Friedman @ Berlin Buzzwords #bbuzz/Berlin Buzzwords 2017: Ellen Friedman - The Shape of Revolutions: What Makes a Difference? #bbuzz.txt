Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2017: Ellen Friedman - The Shape of Revolutions: What Makes a Difference? #bbuzz
Publication date: 2020-02-12

Description: 
	There’s a revolution underway in how people work with data. Streaming data is no longer seen as a special use case – and that’s a good thing because streaming is a better fit to the way life happens. Innovative technologies for robust stream processing are changing what you can reasonably expect to do with stream-based applications, particularly when low latency is required. Apache Flink is one such emerging technology, and its popularity is growing.

Innovation by those who design and develop new technologies is, however, just one-half of an effective data revolution. It’s not just the people who build the disruptive technologies who must have vision if significant change is to occur: the users of those new technologies must also have vision if the revolution is to have real impact.

Using specific examples from a variety of projects involving streaming data, this talk focuses on how innovation with real impact can happen, including the shift in thinking and in engineering culture that underlie successful change in how we work with data at scale. For instance, people are beginning to recognize that stream-first architectures are useful even beyond real-time processing.  Another big idea has to do with where data lives: the big data revolution showed us that data structures spanning more than one machine are a good thing -- now a new revolution involves data structures that span more than one continent (geo-distribution) and that go from on-premise to cloud.

We’ll also look at how streaming data supports flexible practices such as a microservices style that have huge implications in IoT, in A/B testing, deployment of machine learning models and other large-scale analytical workflows. Finally we will how the right technologies and the right design can make life easier for developers and for system administrators by creating a separation of concerns.

	00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:12,960
well thank you all very much for coming

00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:14,670
out I realized in today's crazy world I

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,980
should recall the title the shape of

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:20,190
technical revolutions or data Revolution

00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,019
Center end up in somebody's list so I

00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:23,939
want to talk to you about how technical

00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:26,369
revolutions take place what your role

00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:27,689
can be why some are successful and some

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:30,929
are not

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:33,300
I work as a print principal technologist

00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:35,340
for map R I'm a committer on the Apache

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,760
mehoudar name pachi drill projects a

00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,680
huge enthusiast for Apache flink and I

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,450
write some short look for a Riley media

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,600
I would be thrilled if you follow me on

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,730
Twitter all right so what makes an

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,800
innovative idea have real impact whether

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:53,720
it's from ancient history modern things

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,730
why do some of them really find a

00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:59,610
traction and change the way people think

00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,920
in the way that they work so let's start

00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:04,530
with an old story this is from the 19th

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,409
century gregor mendel is basically the

00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:09,480
father of modern genetics my original

00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:11,370
background is biochemist and molecular

00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:14,550
geneticists I'll give you a story from

00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:16,890
my world ok so this is back in the mid

00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:18,660
19th century there was a question of how

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,980
inheritance happens people didn't know

00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,380
about genes they didn't know about any

00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:26,280
of this and so the question was whether

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:28,560
big idea is inheritance blended you does

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,570
the offspring have a combination of

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,030
traits from both parents but where those

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:35,310
traits blend together and he wanted to

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,170
test this being a good scientist you

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:40,200
realize he should do a test he did this

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:42,810
with pea plants about 20,000 people and

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,180
7 traits I give you the example of

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,030
looking at tall and short plants so the

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,170
question is if you look breed those

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,210
together look at the different

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,270
generations if it's blended inheritance

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,400
if you have a tall parent or short

00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:58,799
parent the offspring becomes an

00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,960
intermediate size this is not what he

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,900
observed with his many many trials and

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,640
instead he saw a ratio 3 to one of the

00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:08,759
traits in the offspring and he did this

00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,950
with 7 different traits so big idea a

00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,989
lot of experimental data the data did

00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:15,810
not support blended inheritance it

00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:17,430
supported discontinuous inheritance he

00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,050
went on the thought about that came up

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,760
with terms like dominant reason

00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:22,950
and begin to think about what this

00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,440
process could be again being a very good

00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,390
scientist he knew wasn't just enough to

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,060
make the discovery he had to communicate

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:33,660
this and he did this in two talks to a

00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,810
group of fellow scientists in 1865 and

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:39,390
he followed this up by a publication in

00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:41,940
1866 that was translated called

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:44,700
experiments on plant hybridization so

00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:47,040
this is a huge discovery with very

00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:50,340
strong data to support it this is a very

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,290
big deal and as you can imagine what was

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:55,710
the impact from that what was the effect

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:58,350
well initially it was nothing and the

00:02:55,710 --> 00:03:00,510
reason it was nothing is that those 40

00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:03,540
scientists for example who were present

00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:06,360
at those presentations they got stuck on

00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:09,060
the details or maybe because of the way

00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,340
he named his paper but they thought this

00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:12,960
was interesting it was a nice little set

00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,050
of experiments about plant hybridization

00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,510
and they failed to grasp the enormous

00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:21,170
idea that he had basically provided data

00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:24,180
to explain how the fundamentals of

00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:26,340
genetics works and it was only 30 years

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,650
later that several different scientists

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,930
beginning to have the same ideas and to

00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:33,060
do experiments then rediscovered his

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,280
paper a couple of them were very good

00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,650
about also acknowledging his earlier

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,180
work one was William Bateson who worked

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,590
in the Botanic Garden at Cambridge

00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,350
University in the UK

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,300
another was Kyle corns I think from

00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:48,540
Munich certainly a German scientist and

00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:50,610
they not only popularize these ideas but

00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:53,910
they gave mental credit that he observed

00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:56,250
a deserve for this and the end result of

00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:58,260
that is this idea really lit up for

00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,450
people enormous amount of research

00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:03,390
followed and that brings us up to modern

00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:06,330
day molecular genetics genetics it's a

00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:08,820
huge thing so the lesson that I want you

00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,980
to take away from this is that to have a

00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:13,560
really innovative idea and have it have

00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:15,600
a real effect on people you not only

00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,299
need that creativity the people who

00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:21,570
develops a new technology a new software

00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:23,669
but the users have to have vision they

00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:26,730
have to look beyond just the details and

00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:29,669
think about what they can really do with

00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:32,380
these innovative ideas or technology now

00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:34,570
Big Data itself has been a revolution

00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:36,700
and within that revolution there's a new

00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:39,610
revolution which is to look at streaming

00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:41,770
data so just beginning to work at huge

00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,170
scale people had to realize it isn't

00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,670
just that big is big but you could ask

00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:47,410
questions once you get to a certain

00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:49,450
scale of data that you could never have

00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:51,550
addressed before and now people are

00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:53,440
beginning to see that by working with

00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:57,130
streaming data data from continuous

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,080
events again it changes the way they can

00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:00,640
think and the kinds of applications they

00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,520
can build the way they can do business

00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,810
so let's take a look at how that works

00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,510
there are a lot of different sources of

00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,520
streaming data partly because life

00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:11,890
doesn't happen in batches tends to

00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,050
happen is continuous events even things

00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:16,930
as simple as a user coming to a website

00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:19,180
clicks on the website can be handled as

00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,910
a stream of events but one of the

00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,410
obvious places that we look for

00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:26,440
streaming data is in the Internet of

00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:28,210
Things IOT you see it across you know so

00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:29,890
many different industries a lot of

00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:32,080
change is happening even in the way

00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:33,250
people manufacture so call smart parts

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,320
where they're putting sensors on

00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:37,360
everything they're reporting back not

00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:40,000
only to the user but to the manufacturer

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,280
now the reason a lot of people first

00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,500
start looking to the possibility of

00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,140
working with streaming data is because

00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,780
they need some kind of real-time insight

00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,010
some kind of very low latency

00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:53,620
application that they're building there

00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:55,150
are a number of good tools my focus

00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,620
doesn't seem so great on this but can

00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,720
you see okay I looked at the slides

00:05:56,620 --> 00:06:02,050
alright there are a number of good tools

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:04,870
for doing real-time processing or very

00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:06,640
low latency processing I'm as I said a

00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,710
big enthusiast for the apaches link

00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,670
project anybody in here actually useful

00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:13,090
link right out flink

00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:15,790
yeah okay but there are a lot of

00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:18,400
different good choices for doing the

00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:20,290
processing but what I want to focus on

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,420
for a minute is not the processing that

00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:25,000
go upstream a little bit and it's what

00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:27,580
choices you make in terms of this stream

00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,800
transport and it turns out if you have

00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:31,960
stream transport technology and if the

00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,570
design of your system has certain

00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,920
capabilities it suddenly opens you up to

00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:38,620
what I'm calling a stream first

00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:42,100
architecture has huge advantages as

00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:45,070
surprisingly advantages when cast that

00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,569
kind of mid line through my figure here

00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:48,729
of that real

00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:51,039
timer low latency application so I

00:06:48,729 --> 00:06:53,020
picked an example here say from medical

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,999
industry but you could put whatever you

00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,009
want here financial service is the same

00:06:54,999 --> 00:06:59,229
principle say somebody comes in they

00:06:57,009 --> 00:07:02,229
have data coming in from instrumentation

00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:04,119
they put that into a stream transport

00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:06,039
I'm using a horizontal cylinder to

00:07:04,119 --> 00:07:08,199
indicate that's the message transport

00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:09,969
they've built a real-time application

00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:13,149
maybe updating a real-time dashboard

00:07:09,969 --> 00:07:15,309
that's fine but if they also have the

00:07:13,149 --> 00:07:18,099
right kind of capability in that message

00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:20,619
transport technology in addition to have

00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:22,180
other classes of use cases down at the

00:07:20,619 --> 00:07:24,309
bottom under if you can read it I put

00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:26,199
insurance audit what I'm saying is in

00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:28,869
this setting if you can actually have

00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:31,270
durable messages and indeed long term

00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:33,039
very long term messages

00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:35,619
it means you also have a long term

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,869
auditable history and that can be useful

00:07:35,619 --> 00:07:39,969
in a lot of different industries my set

00:07:37,869 --> 00:07:41,919
of use cases up at the top assume that

00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:43,899
there are situations where instead of

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,669
looking at the event by event history

00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:47,409
you want to look at the current status

00:07:45,669 --> 00:07:49,929
of things maybe data that you would

00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:52,569
realize into a database or a searchable

00:07:49,929 --> 00:07:54,309
document in this case my medical example

00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:57,309
I said that might be electronic medical

00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:58,809
records and that's a different reason to

00:07:57,309 --> 00:08:00,490
use this but they're all coming off of

00:07:58,809 --> 00:08:02,889
that Center at the heart of this dream

00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:05,439
first architecture is the message stream

00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:07,599
so when people begin to broaden their

00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:10,839
thinking they realize that streaming

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,669
data is good for things beyond that kind

00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:14,649
of real-time situation that may be their

00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:16,930
first reason for coming to it and the

00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:19,089
possibilities would become huge now when

00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:21,729
I say the right kind of stream transport

00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:23,259
certain capabilities really matter and I

00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:25,240
think the ones because it's very short

00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:28,019
talk I want to focus on quickly are

00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,579
really the most important thing that a

00:08:28,019 --> 00:08:32,889
patchy coffee in a way really solve this

00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:35,019
problem and I do work with a farm a

00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:37,389
powerhouse extreme transport called map

00:08:35,019 --> 00:08:40,300
are streams that is literally an

00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:42,459
extension of the file system it's all

00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,589
one technology their database their

00:08:42,459 --> 00:08:47,860
stream transport and their distributed

00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:50,380
files but Patti Kafka map our streams

00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,600
which uses kofteh API they share certain

00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:54,459
characteristics and the one that I want

00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,920
you to think about for a moment is that

00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:59,260
they really solve the problem of at very

00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,280
large scale being able to have high

00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,560
performance

00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,420
with durable messages with persistence

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,580
you no longer have to trade that off and

00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:09,340
that turns out have a tremendous effect

00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:11,410
on this kind of architecture by instead

00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,090
of broadcasting the message to the

00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:15,940
consumers message has to be there right

00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:17,470
away so you can do low latency work but

00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,810
the consumer doesn't have to be online

00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:21,490
when the message arrives it can be added

00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:23,950
later you can add a new consumer

00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:25,750
suddenly you decouple the multiple

00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:27,730
consumers multiple producers and

00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:30,310
multiple consumers in this system and

00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:33,460
what that gives you is a tremendous

00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:36,580
flexibility even the ability to do a

00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:38,080
microservices style approach so you need

00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:40,390
that lightweight connector between

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,520
different services instead of a REST API

00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:45,040
in this case you can actually look at

00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:47,230
that as being a message stream and it

00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,930
gives you some huge advantages in how

00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,250
you work take the simple example of a

00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:53,770
situation where you have a fraud

00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:56,110
detector what I might call card velocity

00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:57,580
somebody does a transaction you're

00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:00,550
basically have a machine learning model

00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:02,920
that's saying the location the timing of

00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:05,170
that transaction if I bought a coffee at

00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:07,270
lunch here at 15 minutes later I bought

00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,530
a beautiful silk blouse in Singapore

00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,990
something's not right

00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:12,490
okay so you need a history of previous

00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:14,530
card transactions and you're making that

00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,660
comparison so you have this machine

00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:19,660
learning fraud detector model you have a

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:21,460
database with card history and then as

00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,290
you scale up you have many models

00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,970
addressing that same database because

00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,980
you need to go back to the same data but

00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:28,990
what happens is that begins to heat up

00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,300
you end up with too much traffic it's

00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:33,339
hard to keep performance and also you've

00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:35,410
already refined that data down for this

00:10:33,339 --> 00:10:38,260
particular project for this particular

00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:41,560
application if you change this and do

00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:43,960
something as simple as bring in that

00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:46,270
data stream now you add a data stream

00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,550
for card activity you still have the

00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:50,200
updater process so you're still updating

00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:52,839
your database you're doing this this

00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,300
project in exactly the same way but what

00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:57,400
happens now remember that independence

00:10:55,300 --> 00:11:00,010
of consumers now you can have other

00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:02,500
groups using that same data and indeed

00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:03,880
you your project can be another group

00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,250
because you're going to be rolling out

00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,750
new models that you want to test you're

00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,580
testing them against the same data

00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,410
you're not interfering with what's

00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,290
happening in production and this even

00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:15,329
lets you do a hot handoff very

00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:17,730
easily so suddenly you have a very

00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:19,980
powerful architecture just by adding

00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:21,839
that data stream so the lesson here is

00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,029
to think of the data stream which even

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,040
can be queried directly but that data

00:11:24,029 --> 00:11:27,990
stream as main kind of the universal

00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:29,490
truth it's at the heart of what you and

00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:32,399
other groups in your organization are

00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:35,690
doing the data base becomes a very

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:38,310
powerful and very useful but specialized

00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:39,930
thing that's set up for each different

00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:42,060
project so it's optimized when

00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:44,610
individual projects are doing but you're

00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:46,589
retaining all of that detail in the data

00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:48,480
by keeping it in a data stream that

00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:50,130
everybody is going back to so they don't

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,600
interfere with each other and you

00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:54,000
haven't thrown away data that later

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,759
you'll find out with the key data that

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,709
you needed for some reason additionally

00:11:56,759 --> 00:12:00,600
people are especially with machine

00:11:58,709 --> 00:12:03,120
learning models looking for ways that

00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:05,670
they can act locally but learn globally

00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,220
and essentially work with what I'm

00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:11,610
calling a global data fabric and what I

00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:13,829
mean by that is the ability to work with

00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:16,860
the same data from different locations

00:12:13,829 --> 00:12:18,630
do that on premises do it in cloud from

00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,089
cloud to cloud it really doesn't matter

00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:22,430
that you how many people in here think

00:12:21,089 --> 00:12:26,639
of themselves we're on the side of

00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:29,579
developers is IT and admin layer

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:34,290
developers data scientists okay that's

00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:36,690
what I was guessing so it this ability

00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:38,670
to work with a global data fabric as a

00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,290
developer you want to use the data that

00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:42,540
you want you want to be able to have

00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:44,579
access to all data if you need it for a

00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,709
particular project some data you

00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:48,180
probably shouldn't have access to so

00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:50,399
whoever is controlling that should be

00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:52,110
able to keep the data in one country

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,370
that's not supposed to move not give you

00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:54,990
access to things you don't want to

00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:56,819
access to but you don't want to have to

00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:58,470
have a committee meeting every time you

00:12:56,819 --> 00:13:00,240
write a new application or build a new

00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:02,490
model and so what we're really looking

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,949
for are systems that give you the

00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,810
ability to access whatever you want the

00:13:04,949 --> 00:13:08,399
people who deal with ICANN system

00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:10,829
administration to be able to do that

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,990
conveniently and not have to be asking

00:13:10,829 --> 00:13:15,269
you constantly what are you building

00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:17,100
you know it's a real multi-tenant system

00:13:15,269 --> 00:13:19,350
where you can do what you need they move

00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,959
data where it needs to be control access

00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:26,040
you have access to what you need and by

00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:28,470
separating those concerns both groups

00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:30,600
do their work much more effectively this

00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:32,279
really makes a huge difference now I've

00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,050
put up this example because I want to

00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:36,720
talk to you about a real-world example I

00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:39,449
do consulting for math our map R is an

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:42,149
unusual technology as I said and that

00:13:39,449 --> 00:13:44,670
they're distributed data platform is a

00:13:42,149 --> 00:13:47,880
single technology that has distributed

00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:50,040
files a real file system message

00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:52,470
transport database it's all built

00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:54,690
together and in fact this is looking at

00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:57,269
a home directory you see files tables

00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:59,550
and streams in that same directory this

00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:01,620
cluster and volume mount point that you

00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:04,680
see down in the corner is basically a

00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:07,350
key to how they basically have a global

00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:11,420
namespace and so these capabilities

00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:13,889
combined with the ability to do a direct

00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:16,290
multi-master on the directional table

00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:20,190
replication multi-master omnidirectional

00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:22,319
extreme replication really makes you

00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:24,750
able to work in this sort of global data

00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:27,750
fabric style and with the separation of

00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:30,120
concerns map our streams works similar

00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,829
to Kafka in many ways you have topics a

00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,870
couple of differences though in this

00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:36,350
case is that you can have hundreds of

00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:39,779
thousands or millions of topics easily

00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:42,720
running on the same machine you collect

00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:43,889
those together into first class object

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,829
called a stream and that's where

00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:48,480
policies such as time to live and

00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:51,120
replication or set and so it really

00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,790
makes a difference in this sense of if

00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,709
you the drill for building this

00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:57,690
application as a consumer from this

00:14:55,709 --> 00:14:59,730
stream it doesn't matter if that data

00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:02,399
source is in the same geographical

00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:04,260
location or with stream replication if

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,389
it's halfway around the world that's not

00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:08,399
a concern for you and so you really

00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:10,709
separate that and you get a huge

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,420
advantage I'm running out of time so I'm

00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:15,060
going to race through this but a map our

00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:16,949
customer that does streaming video they

00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,470
need to be able to deal with metrics

00:15:16,949 --> 00:15:21,300
monitoring their huge amounts of data

00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:23,459
and need very low latency and their

00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:26,550
particular situation here they were

00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:28,380
using map are but they switched to now

00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:30,779
using map our streams in the stream

00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:32,910
first sort of style taking advantage of

00:15:30,779 --> 00:15:35,189
stream replication and in just a couple

00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:37,260
of months their ability to deal with

00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:39,630
data from the data center moving into

00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,960
global headquarters and be able to do

00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,540
that

00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:44,460
from multiple data centers made such a

00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,290
difference just that one change in how

00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:48,240
they're working that they came back to

00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:50,220
us and said they basically felt like

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,470
they had a year of development time in

00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:55,080
the bank so think for a minute if you

00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:56,460
had a free year you're still on target

00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,770
and could work on anything you wanted

00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:00,180
extra for a year you know where would

00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:02,040
that leave you that's a wonderful

00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:04,320
feeling and so that separation of

00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,870
concerns what they found is by having

00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,510
the platform deal with logistics it

00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:11,100
freed them up to deal with what they

00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,410
wanted to build and not have to do all

00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,880
of that at the application level so it

00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:16,380
doesn't really matter the individual

00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,060
industry you can see this would have

00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:20,550
application in a lot of different

00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:22,290
projects I just remind you I've talked

00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,670
to their previous buzzwords about the

00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:27,240
importance of communicating between

00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:28,950
teams and this is particularly important

00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,280
you guys have very technical knowledge

00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:34,380
if you want to avoid the problem of the

00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:36,960
40 scientist who didn't appreciate what

00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:39,000
Mendel did it's really a challenge for

00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:41,040
you but you have to talk to people with

00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,140
different domain knowledge outside your

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,820
organization within your organization

00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:48,180
and also one way to make that work

00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:50,940
really well is to think about your

00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:53,280
expertise as data scientist as as

00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:55,230
machine learning experts whatever it is

00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,690
that you do but in addition you were

00:16:55,230 --> 00:17:00,180
having specific projects and so don't

00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:01,650
think of yourself as I'm loaning time or

00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:04,020
having to talk to somebody from another

00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:07,530
department but also see those cross

00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:09,959
departmental cuts as an individual

00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:11,880
project and people really you know pull

00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,010
together that way they work better

00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,300
together and yet they keep their own you

00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,620
know their own ability and their own

00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,510
expertise they have to change their

00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,160
communication but I think that's easier

00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:23,220
to do when you really do see that you

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,540
have common goals last thought here I

00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,850
probably have mentioned this in previous

00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,680
years but I love this project again I

00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:31,680
know about it because I write about the

00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:33,390
things that map our customers do the I

00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:35,400
can't pronounce this correctly but the

00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:38,610
what I call the odd heart project in

00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:41,880
India is a universal ID project for

00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:44,040
India all 1.2 billion people will have a

00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:45,900
unique identification of projects almost

00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,690
complete in terms of signing people up

00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:52,110
the authentication part of this project

00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:53,900
they have a unique multi digit number

00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:56,610
they use biometric data

00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:58,800
but all of this has to be able to be

00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:00,630
authenticated and about as long as it

00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:03,330
would take you to swipe a credit card

00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:06,390
but this has to be able to be available

00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:09,870
entirely available 24 hours a day 7 days

00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:12,930
a week from anywhere in India so it's a

00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:15,000
huge SLA from the social side of it they

00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:16,680
had tried to do this with HBase they

00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,390
simply couldn't meet that kind of

00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:21,240
reliability without more and more and

00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:22,770
more clusters in November 2014 they

00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,710
moved the authentication part of the

00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:28,110
project over to the map are no sequel

00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:31,020
database map our DB and they have had

00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:32,730
zero downtime since then why I love this

00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:35,280
project though I wanted to tell you

00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:38,010
about it is when I first heard about it

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,050
was a talk about a party bee but I was

00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:41,760
thinking ok so they made a you know

00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:43,620
personal ID like that's nice why did

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,960
they do it which shows my ignorance and

00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:49,580
so as I found out more about it this is

00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:52,290
a a project that changes lies at a

00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:54,300
societal level now some of the poorest

00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:56,130
people in India are able to have

00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:59,040
businesses they can open a bank account

00:18:56,130 --> 00:19:01,560
they can get a loan it's tremendously

00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,990
changed how much money gets siphoned off

00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:06,390
from government government welfare to

00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:08,160
fraud because people show up and say you

00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:09,660
know give me money to support these

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,730
hundred workers in my factory and they

00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:14,070
say ok show us the hundred workers you

00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:17,070
know what's their ID so this has had a

00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:19,500
massive effect and the thing that's cool

00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:21,660
we did need a good technology that was

00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,730
why I started looking at it but the

00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:27,150
fundamental innovation there and the

00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:30,480
real impact is the people who had the

00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:33,030
vision to build it but also to see how

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,830
to use it to see what it could do people

00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:37,590
who had the vision to see what that

00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:40,200
tremendous idea could bring about now

00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:42,570
it's been an honor to be here in Berlin

00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:44,220
this last spring I was very happy to see

00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:46,380
some beautiful pictures of the people

00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:49,260
who came out for a science March and so

00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:51,630
I'm basically speaking here in a place

00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:53,850
where I know that people understand data

00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,110
and I know they're very creative people

00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:58,020
and when you put those two things

00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:59,430
together amazing things can happen so I

00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:02,190
leave you with this question

00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:05,310
what is it that you will build what's

00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:07,590
the impact going to be so I just want to

00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:09,510
remind you there is a short Data Report

00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:12,179
that deals with this idea of global data

00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:14,279
fabric all these are available map are

00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:16,260
well or ugly selves the little books and

00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:17,460
go away the data report but map are

00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,770
makes them all available on the website

00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:21,630
if you want to go there the links are in

00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:23,520
the slides which will be put up or talk

00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:26,370
to me after and I'll email you the links

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:28,919
there's a short book that I wrote with

00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:30,510
Ted dubbing who spoke earlier and who

00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:33,330
right now is doing a totally cool

00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:36,840
demonstration on IOT data with -

00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:39,000
together with Tugg in the Palais Italia

00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,590
at the top of the where the roof garden

00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,090
is and I'm going to be running over

00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,740
there after because it's going to be fun

00:20:42,090 --> 00:20:46,049
they have little connected cars and

00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:47,760
devices and it's really cool anyway a

00:20:46,049 --> 00:20:51,090
lot of these ideas are in this streaming

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:53,340
architecture book and with cosa suman's

00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:56,100
I wrote a short introduction to Apache

00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:58,230
flink the data artisans guys have a few

00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,940
copies all have some copies over at the

00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:03,090
IOT demonstration and they're all

00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:05,010
available online please continue to help

00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:06,990
support women in technology it's

00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:09,899
something that's important not just for

00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:11,760
women but for society and this is one

00:21:09,899 --> 00:21:13,860
woman in high tech in the middle of a

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,800
jet engine and I thank you all very much

00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:22,750
for having me here

00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:22,750
