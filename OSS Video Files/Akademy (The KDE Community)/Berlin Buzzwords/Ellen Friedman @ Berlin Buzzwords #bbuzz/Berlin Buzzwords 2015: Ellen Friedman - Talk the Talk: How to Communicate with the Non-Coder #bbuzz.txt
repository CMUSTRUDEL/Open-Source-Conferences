Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2015: Ellen Friedman - Talk the Talk: How to Communicate with the Non-Coder #bbuzz
Publication date: 2020-02-12
Playlist: Ellen Friedman @ Berlin Buzzwords #bbuzz
Description: 
	Your first thought may be: Why would I want to talk to non-coders? Buzzwords is a developers’ conference, and most users of open source software also are developers. But there’s a huge advantage to be gained by being able to describe what you do – the capabilities and the reasonable limitations – in powerful, non-technical ways that let you communicate effectively with project managers, those with useful domain knowledge, and in the case of some open source projects, the users. 

Take the new Apache Drill offering, for example. The community of Drill users comprise widely different groups. It includes developers who will appreciate the flexibility and extensibility of Drill as they incorporate it into their own projects plus business analysts with less deep technical developer knowledge but with strong experience and serious goals analyzing big data with BI tools. It helps for those developing Drill to be able to clearly see their needs and talk about how Drill may address them. 

Describing technical work in non-technical terms does not mean “dumbing it down”. Much to the contrary, it means having sufficiently clear conceptual understanding of your own work that you can cut to the heart of the essential aspects and communicate them to people with a wide range of different background expertise. This approach is particularly useful with machine learning projects in which clear communication with business clients and domain experts about the applicability of available data sources can make or break a project.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,030
I

00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:11,570
I feel like I need to put on my sunglass

00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:13,730
it's very bright here sir okay here we

00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:16,160
go I'm going to talk to you today about

00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:19,850
how to talk to non coders let's see if I

00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:21,680
can advance this properly yes I work as

00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:24,770
consultant right now mostly consulting

00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,960
for map our technologies I also am a

00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,910
committer in the Apache mahout project

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,860
and a contributor to Apache drill

00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:32,390
project I'll repeat this contact

00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,400
information at the ends you don't need

00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,079
to worry about it now and today I'm

00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,420
going to talk to you about whether there

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,190
actually is a problem in talking between

00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,840
people who have kind of a mismatch in

00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:44,989
terms of their technical background and

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,519
whether in fact that matters do we need

00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:48,710
to do anything to address the problem

00:00:46,519 --> 00:00:50,300
and if so what you might be able to do

00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,280
to make it better I'll give you a

00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,469
homework assignment and I'll supply you

00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:56,750
with a parrot joke not necessarily in

00:00:54,469 --> 00:00:59,239
that order so let's start off with the

00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:01,039
question of is there a problem well when

00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:02,420
you have a really technical person and

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,699
they are trying to talk to an audience

00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,130
who's less technical than they are how

00:01:04,699 --> 00:01:08,570
does that feel well in some cases it may

00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,790
feel like they're actually talking to a

00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:12,380
different species there's really a

00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,790
challenge to be able to talk where

00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:16,280
there's a big gap in terms of

00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:18,140
understanding and it's a challenge it

00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,300
takes a lot of effort to overcome in

00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,400
some cases the question is what does it

00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,110
look like from the other side so when

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,970
people see something like this for

00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:28,100
example if you're a machine learning

00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:29,840
expert if you're a data scientist you

00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:33,080
may be perfectly happy to see this

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:35,450
because basically techies enjoyed the

00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:39,500
occasional blast of algorithms and code

00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:41,570
but what about everybody else how did

00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:43,310
they feel when they see that now I want

00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,630
to do a very quick survey it's a little

00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,250
hard to see out in the audience but

00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,170
let's see a show of hands how many

00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:51,470
people here have actually conducted

00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:53,750
brain surgery okay oddly enough no one

00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:56,120
but if you talk to a room full of brain

00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:58,340
surgeons you'd probably find I'm just

00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:01,310
guessing that most of them actually

00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:03,470
don't know how to program C++ in fact

00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,990
they probably couldn't even debug a Java

00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:08,179
program but this doesn't mean that

00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,379
they're stupid people and in fact they

00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:10,970
actually house in pretty technical

00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:13,790
knowledge and its knowledge that's a

00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:16,910
value but its knowledge that's kind of a

00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:19,580
mismatch with the technologies of most

00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:21,240
of people at the the conference here so

00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,560
the challenge comes when

00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,900
the two groups of people have really

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:29,160
different background the question then

00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:30,810
arises what how do you dress up your

00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,660
message so it can go to cross to other

00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:35,880
people and I challenge you to say if

00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:39,000
what you have to say if what you work on

00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:40,950
is actually important it as a value your

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,230
message actually deserves to be

00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,480
presented in a way that the audience can

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,280
understand it instead of being lost in

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,170
technical jargon that won't mean

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,940
anything to the other side so you need

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,560
to know your audience and then be able

00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:55,890
to understand what might convey the

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,290
message to them so this is a bit of a

00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,330
problem but it still raises question of

00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,280
is it a problem that's important to

00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,200
solve I mean the other approaches just

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,030
don't talk to people who don't have the

00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,760
right kind of technical skills for the

00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:11,190
things that you do well I don't know

00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,870
this is a little comedy video that we

00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,270
see a lot it see if you laughter is it

00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:16,950
anybody's actually seen this it's called

00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:19,560
the expert or people refer to it as

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:21,840
seven red lines and so for those of you

00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,250
who haven't seen it this is an expert

00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,020
who's been called in to talk to a

00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:27,780
marketing team they have a new project

00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,430
and the requirements are to draw seven

00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,620
red lines each of them exactly

00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:34,740
perpendicular to the other and they are

00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,600
required to draw it with some with green

00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:38,880
ink and some with transparent ink and

00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:42,690
then they ask the expert can you do this

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,420
and so I ask you can you do this and the

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:46,920
answer of course is no I would like to

00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:49,140
give you some advice if you find

00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,050
yourself in a situation where people are

00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,940
asking requirements and the people tend

00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:55,650
to be like the ones in this video my

00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:58,770
best advice to you the way to approach

00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:01,290
that is just run run fast get out of

00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:04,080
there because they're really not going

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:06,360
to work but the good news is usually not

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,950
always in real life situations the

00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,300
people that you have to work with even

00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,760
if they have different technical skills

00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,860
in your own are not quite as much idiots

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,630
as the people who are in this video so

00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,330
that's a good news sometimes they are

00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:20,580
but usually they're not and however it

00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:22,080
can often feel like they are and the

00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:24,600
reason for that is that there's such a

00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,040
mismatch between the tenth of the skills

00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,530
that you have in the skills of the

00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,540
audience so again the question comes is

00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,190
it worth the effort to try to go that

00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,129
extra distance to figure out how to

00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,589
convey what you

00:04:33,129 --> 00:04:38,050
to say to people who don't know what you

00:04:35,589 --> 00:04:39,669
know well I think it is worth it some

00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,919
people who are non coders are actually

00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:43,929
worth listening to for example Steve

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,219
Jobs actually didn't code but he had

00:04:43,929 --> 00:04:47,319
some ideas that made a big difference

00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:48,789
for Apple products and for the company

00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:50,289
there are a lot of people who are a

00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:53,199
value to listen to even though they

00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:54,909
don't have your technical skills this

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:57,729
may be particularly true to your own

00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:59,429
project often the people that are the

00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:01,389
people who fund the work that you do

00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:03,159
aren't the people who can actually

00:05:01,389 --> 00:05:05,110
execute it that's why they're hiring you

00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:07,240
and so being able to talk to them

00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,800
clearly about the needs you have I mean

00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,269
this is really an engineering question

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,219
what are the resources where the

00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:14,649
resources that you need what are the

00:05:12,219 --> 00:05:17,319
resources available what's a schedule

00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:19,839
like what kind of time to market or time

00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:23,019
to value are they asking for you know is

00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:24,490
there a real match for one thing how do

00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:26,379
you tell if you're successful how do

00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:27,969
they tell if you're successful so you

00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:29,679
need some kind of mutual understanding

00:05:27,969 --> 00:05:31,749
of how good is good and what is good

00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:33,429
look like so there are a lot of reasons

00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:35,469
it's very important to be able to have a

00:05:33,429 --> 00:05:37,089
real serious conversation with good

00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:39,519
understanding on both sides in that

00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:42,249
situation another reason that you might

00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:44,079
need to talk to non coders is because

00:05:42,249 --> 00:05:46,059
they have domain knowledge that's

00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:47,589
important to the project you're doing so

00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:49,569
taking the example of people working

00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:51,550
with the Internet of Things you may be

00:05:49,569 --> 00:05:53,889
perfectly happy using time series data

00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:56,829
and building your very sophisticated and

00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:58,509
inefficient time series database but

00:05:56,829 --> 00:06:00,279
they're also can be situations in which

00:05:58,509 --> 00:06:02,349
you really need to talk to people at the

00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:04,599
other end of the project the ones who

00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:06,490
are designing sensors choosing what

00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:08,409
sensors to use deciding what measures

00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,819
months to make deciding what they want

00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:12,279
to do with those data what the ultimate

00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:13,929
goals are so there's reason to have to

00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:16,839
talk to people in different parts of a

00:06:13,929 --> 00:06:18,249
project here is an example I want to use

00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:20,110
just because I think it's incredibly

00:06:18,249 --> 00:06:22,839
cool project I don't know if you've

00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:24,839
heard of aadhaar but this project is

00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:28,809
trying to meet the challenge of

00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:31,719
producing a unique identity a 12-digit

00:06:28,809 --> 00:06:34,300
random number plus biometric data to

00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:36,159
identify every person in India all 1.2

00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,569
billion of them they're a little half

00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:40,449
way more than halfway through the

00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:42,520
project I was particularly interested in

00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:45,099
it because they chose to use

00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:47,349
a map are no sequel database map our DB

00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:49,419
to run the authentication part of the

00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:51,879
project and the reason they chose that

00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:54,310
is there are very extremely requirements

00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:57,460
besides a huge amount of data for it

00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:59,069
authentication authentication has to be

00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:02,379
done where it's available

00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:04,840
twenty-four-seven very low risk low

00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:06,400
latency very fast response time so it

00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,039
has to be in milliseconds it's very

00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,229
extreme requirements now when you look

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,330
at that you say why make it so extreme

00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:15,280
but here's where it becomes important to

00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:17,050
realize that for a project to work well

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,449
people at different parts of the project

00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:21,310
near need to communicate if you look at

00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:23,169
what the project is doing which is

00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:25,659
basically trying to change a lot about

00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:28,960
Society in India they're trying to make

00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:31,300
a normal kind of banking transactions

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,610
being able to have a loan from a bank

00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,680
being able to deliver government welfare

00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:37,360
in efficient ways so that there's not

00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,099
fraud and money being drained off

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,900
they're trying to deliver this to every

00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:43,479
person in India including the very

00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:45,550
poorest members of society and they need

00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:48,669
for people to be able to do this to do

00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:50,979
these transactions anywhere they are any

00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:53,020
time they need to do it so anywhere

00:07:50,979 --> 00:07:54,729
anytime is the requirement and that's

00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:57,699
why it translates back to some very

00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:59,349
specific requirements on the technical

00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:03,550
side very important for different parts

00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:05,770
of the project to communicate so the

00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:07,539
good news is that the kinds of skills

00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:09,340
that you guys have are incredibly

00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:11,259
valuable and they fit it a lot of

00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:13,029
different situations but what that means

00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:15,250
is to work effectively and to be

00:08:13,029 --> 00:08:16,750
appreciated for the value have you have

00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,789
to be able to talk to people who have a

00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,979
wide variety of different backgrounds I

00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:22,360
think it really is worth fixing this

00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:24,729
problem although it takes a lot of

00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,770
effort to do it but the question is how

00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:29,949
and so of course that means it's time

00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:31,900
for a parrot joke okay a man walks into

00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:33,640
a pet store and wants to buy a birthday

00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,979
gift for his mother he sees this

00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,110
beautiful parrot it's very expensive but

00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:39,789
the parrot speaks 12 languages so he

00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:42,130
decides it's worth it he sends it to his

00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:44,290
mom he calls her up in wishes are happy

00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:47,440
birthday a few days later says mom did

00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:50,410
you like the parrot she says it was okay

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,600
it was a little bit tough he goes tough

00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:54,579
you ate this parent the parent costs

00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,290
three thousand euros it spoke 12

00:08:54,579 --> 00:08:58,029
languages it was brilliant

00:08:56,290 --> 00:09:01,509
she said well it should have said

00:08:58,029 --> 00:09:04,240
something so the message here is that it

00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:07,060
is important to develop a message that

00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,889
shows off what you do at value in a way

00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,930
that your audience whoever they may be

00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:12,279
can actually see the value in what you

00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:14,920
do otherwise you're selling yourself

00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:17,290
short and to do that you may need to

00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,790
adjust your style of communication so

00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:21,399
there are many different ways to

00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:23,889
communicate sometimes communicating

00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:26,079
technical information by telling a good

00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:28,300
story this is Sebastian and costas and

00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:30,699
kind of the early days of fling before

00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:33,279
it was called flink actually at a buzz

00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:35,670
words conference pick language that

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,110
works pick terminology that works of

00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:40,959
visuals are important diagrams can be

00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:43,209
very powerful to communicate ideas and

00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,399
to set relationships of ideas in a

00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:47,170
person's mind in a way that their mind

00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:49,089
can retrieve that information later

00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:54,790
becomes a good foundation on which to

00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:56,350
build details as well choose language

00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:58,930
that's appropriate for the audience

00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:01,149
sometimes alternative towards diagrams

00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:03,160
have mentioned demos can be useful you

00:10:01,149 --> 00:10:05,380
show someone how something works instead

00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,240
of just describe it especially if you're

00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,399
working with a smaller group maybe a

00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,199
committee meeting or something having an

00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:13,389
interactive discussion can be more

00:10:11,199 --> 00:10:15,040
powerful than just a presentation and by

00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:17,079
interactive I don't mean saying that the

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,510
audience does anybody have any questions

00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:21,699
or saying to the audience does everybody

00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:23,110
know how to do this I mean who's going

00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:25,480
to be brave enough to put their hand up

00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:27,459
and say no instead you initiate a

00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,470
conversation by asking some sort of

00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:31,839
leading question get them talking about

00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:34,149
what they know what their ideas are that

00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:36,670
reveals to you where the level of the

00:10:34,149 --> 00:10:38,470
conversation need is the pieces you need

00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:40,360
to fill in you also learn a lot about

00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:43,480
what's important to them which in the

00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:45,510
end will be important to you so building

00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,680
this in layers by empathy I mean

00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:49,540
understanding what matters to the

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,160
audience and respecting that enough to

00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:54,220
actually deal with it can really pay off

00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,649
now use this example Ted spoke yesterday

00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,959
of catchy drill we're pretty interested

00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:01,569
in this project 1 point 0 release was

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,040
just made this is a point in time where

00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:04,899
people have built it now what's

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,209
important is to have people use it and

00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:08,920
begin to hear how that works so it's

00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:10,000
time to change the message instead of

00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,130
talking a lot

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,220
in terms of developers and to developers

00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:17,200
about the design about the engineering

00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,180
and architecture it's hard to actually

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,490
start talking about what drill can do

00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,290
and how people can use it and to start

00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:25,660
to build out the community of users and

00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:27,460
to understand what they're doing so in

00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,690
that situation is still a technical

00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:30,280
communication but it's a different

00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:33,760
technical audience for a different

00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:35,500
purpose this is just a reminder to say

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,510
I've talked about using diagrams but

00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,700
whether it's a diagram or whatever it is

00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:41,680
it's really important to kind of pretest

00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,120
what you do against the naive audience

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,220
just to see if it's getting across the

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,870
idea they want this is a diagram that

00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:49,600
was from a book that 10 and I wrote

00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:50,950
recently called real world Hadoop it was

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,560
just probably wanted to make a point

00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:55,060
about real-world streaming that's being

00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:58,150
done on Hadoop cluster and the

00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:00,580
importance of queueing the diagram was

00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:02,380
originally drawn just as black and white

00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,030
and i found that showing it to somebody

00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,740
there were so many parts of the diagram

00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:07,720
even though it was pretty simple that

00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,460
the single message wasn't popping out

00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:11,260
something is simple I don't if you can

00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,120
see on the slide it's grayed out just

00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:16,030
kind of the path through this workflow

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,760
that is the real the real time streaming

00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:21,100
path lets people see it but still see it

00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,230
in a context of other things so whatever

00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,190
it is that you're trying to convey put

00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:26,290
it together in a way that you think

00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:28,089
works but then just you know momentarily

00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:31,240
test it against somebody and see if that

00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:33,250
pops out for them it's really important

00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:35,980
to get to the essential concepts of what

00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:38,470
you do I don't mean generalizing that's

00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,240
not essential but refining down to the

00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,520
the absolute most basic and most

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,800
important ideas this isn't always easy

00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,270
to do because you work in a field where

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,339
you have to deal with a lot of details

00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:49,930
so making time for yourself too good way

00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:52,660
and really think about what the key

00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:54,520
ideas are can matter a lot it helps you

00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:57,450
be clever it helps you communicate and

00:12:54,520 --> 00:13:00,370
it helps you distinguish between

00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:01,690
basically solutions which people tend to

00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:03,370
start talking about and what the actual

00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:07,420
goals are to make sure there's not a

00:13:03,370 --> 00:13:09,010
mismatch so if you have a key idea then

00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,470
you can begin to build on that build

00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:13,470
relationships add details and layers and

00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:16,240
that also helps people with recall

00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:18,130
people say meet people have way that's a

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,920
way to make things work I say meet them

00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:22,420
more than halfway you can control what

00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,290
you do go to their level of

00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:25,180
understanding and

00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:27,070
back to whatever are the key ideas

00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:29,500
they're just a quick look one or another

00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:31,300
book that we did was the first in a

00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,389
series on practical machine learning and

00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:36,100
this one trying to convey some ideas of

00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:39,009
how important it is and how powerful it

00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:41,680
is to use search technology to deploy a

00:13:39,009 --> 00:13:43,420
recommender and we had to think about

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,709
how to do this with different audiences

00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,690
because you never know who's in your

00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:48,430
audience technical people non-technical

00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,350
people we wanted to expand the

00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:53,380
conversation beyond the people who

00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:55,209
normally think about machine learning so

00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:57,370
we tried to define down for ourselves

00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:59,380
what we thought were the key ideas that

00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,360
we wanted to convey and even there there

00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,130
was a hierarchy so the two most

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,050
important ideas we wanted to convey is

00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:06,819
that search technology can help you

00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:09,310
build a powerful recommender in a very

00:14:06,819 --> 00:14:11,589
simple way and deploy it very simply and

00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:13,990
that the data that you want to look at

00:14:11,589 --> 00:14:19,959
is what people do rather than just

00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:21,310
ratings we made it non scary by starting

00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:23,380
with a very simple story about what

00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:25,180
people do and using cartoons making it

00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:27,519
fun so you can think about what somebody

00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:30,250
has and how that would be the basis of

00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,620
making recommendations even something as

00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:35,319
simple as a simple diagram to represent

00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:37,630
the relationship between users and items

00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:39,670
and log files we find that people

00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:41,589
reacted to it better if you again put it

00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,850
in the kind of cartoon style and that

00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:45,310
way you can actually lead them through

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:46,779
thinking how a search document is used

00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:49,899
the different fields are used for the

00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:51,940
metadata how you go through basically

00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:54,459
matrix algebra do these different

00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:56,410
transformations from a user history

00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:58,899
behavior matrix through a co-occurrence

00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:00,610
matrix to finding indicators and how

00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:02,829
those indicators them can very very

00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:04,510
simply just add it as another feel of

00:15:02,829 --> 00:15:06,399
the document so even though they can't

00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:08,439
execute it they see the power in it and

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,880
that helps him buy into a project and

00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:12,310
then maybe support it for people who

00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,170
want who are actually going to do it the

00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:16,959
last thought of our alluded to this is

00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:19,329
it's important to respect people from

00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,670
the other team if they deserve to be

00:15:19,329 --> 00:15:23,410
respected but prepare yourself to

00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:25,779
respective and that helps you really

00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:27,189
understand what their ideas are it helps

00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:29,470
you understand where they're missing the

00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:31,750
point of what you're saying your

00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:33,310
homework assignment is to take something

00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:36,279
something very technical and very

00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:37,279
important to you build one diagram write

00:15:36,279 --> 00:15:39,079
a five minute present

00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,120
something very simple thing just to

00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:43,339
convey an idea and then test it out

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,529
against a simple / a simple person well

00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:47,779
it's fine to it against a naive person

00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:50,209
and see if the techniques are working

00:15:47,779 --> 00:15:51,889
for you just to kind of put it into

00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:52,999
action and see if you can take home some

00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:55,819
of the things that I've talked about

00:15:52,999 --> 00:15:58,189
today so summary the lesson it's worth

00:15:55,819 --> 00:16:00,170
fixing the problem it's very important

00:15:58,189 --> 00:16:02,329
to find the essential concepts and what

00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:04,430
you do that's going to pay off for you

00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:06,949
in a lot of ways distinguish between

00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:09,079
goals and technical solutions respect

00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:11,329
the other people help them see the value

00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:13,550
in what you do choose an appropriate

00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:14,959
style of communication for whatever the

00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,730
audience is because you'll talk to a

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:18,639
range of people and of course have a

00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:20,839
parrot joke ready if at all possible

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,790
we've written four of these little books

00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,949
that have the same style that we talked

00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:27,470
about Ted is right here with the Red Hat

00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:29,779
we've done four in the last year so it's

00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:32,240
been kind of a tiring year O'Reilly

00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:34,249
sells these or if you want a free e-copy

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,980
map are as making them available as a

00:16:34,249 --> 00:16:38,870
free download and the links to do that

00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:40,459
are there Ted and I are you going to be

00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:42,649
available to break ken and I are going

00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:45,170
to be available at the break sitting at

00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:47,480
just a table look for his red hat and we

00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:49,250
have a short stack of some copies of

00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,490
books to give away or if you have

00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:54,139
questions come and talk to us about it a

00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:56,930
small and shameless plug to say please

00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:59,509
support women in technology help girls

00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:01,720
find their dreams and I thank you very

00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:01,720
