Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2018: Ellen Friedman â€“ Beyond the Algorithm: What Makes Machine Learning Work?
Publication date: 2020-02-12
Playlist: Ellen Friedman @ Berlin Buzzwords #bbuzz
Description: 
	Thereâ€™s a lot of excitement and growing interest in machine learning, even in mainstream business practice. The Data Scientist is a Star whose skills are much in demand. But for machine learning to be a practical success in real world, production settings, thereâ€™s a lot beyond the algorithm and model that must be done correctly. 

Is the question or issue being addressed by machine learning appropriate for the specific goal? Can models be evaluated in a meaningful way and deployed and maintained in production with the expertise available? Is there sufficient domain knowledge to make certain the project is addressing the right issues? Is there a way to take practical action on the insights gained through machine-driven decisions?

This presentation will explore real world examples to discover some of the pitfalls to avoid and to show a variety of tips and best practices - from planning to model management and deployment in production -- that can help make your machine learning systems successful.

	00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:10,540
so thank you all for coming out here

00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:12,580
this talk is really about what makes

00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,200
things practical those little things

00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:17,170
that can stand in the way of something

00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,779
working like this is the seventh time

00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:22,210
I've been at buzzwords and I actually

00:00:19,779 --> 00:00:23,500
went to the wrong meeting room thinking

00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,000
I knew the names of the room and

00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,800
wondered why Holden was on the same

00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,140
stage where I thought I was giving a

00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,430
talk so it's those little practical

00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,290
things that can get in the way of

00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,520
success if you're not careful we're

00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:36,309
gonna look at how that works with

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,110
machine learning this is not to say that

00:00:36,309 --> 00:00:40,390
the algorithm you pick the way you build

00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:43,330
a model is not absolutely essential to

00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,130
success but that's the kind of exciting

00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:47,710
sexy part of it that people tend to

00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:49,240
focus on and sometimes not look at all

00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:51,460
the things that are wrapped around that

00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,560
that make a difference for a machine

00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:56,560
learning system a machine learning

00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:59,410
project to really be a success not in

00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:02,230
isolation evaluated one model against

00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:04,809
another but to be a success embedded in

00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:07,860
real-world business situations and so

00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:11,409
that's what we want to look at today

00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:14,380
this is me I'm principal technologist

00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:16,930
with map our technologies based in San

00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:19,000
Jose I'm also committed on a couple of

00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:21,220
Apache projects and I've written several

00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,260
short books with O'Reilly this is my

00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,990
contact information and I repeat that at

00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:28,390
the end of the talk so what we want to

00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,830
look at today are the issues that really

00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:32,770
make a difference for machine learning

00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:35,530
real value in production settings and so

00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:37,630
let's start with the obvious fairly

00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:40,090
specific question you probably all have

00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:42,190
in your mind already and that is what is

00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:45,430
a chicken plus tensorflow have to do a

00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:46,720
success in machine learning okay so we

00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:49,990
should start with something a little bit

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,090
fun but this is a real story as well we

00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:54,490
have a friend and colleague and Downard

00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:57,220
he's a very good data engineer he's a

00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:59,770
software engineer what he is not is a

00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:01,509
data scientist he's never tried machine

00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:03,700
learning before but he got very

00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:05,799
intrigued after he went to a talk by

00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,049
some Google evangelists talking about

00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:10,450
tensorflow he was excited about the idea

00:02:08,049 --> 00:02:12,909
of deep learning image recognition and

00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:14,349
he really wanted to give it a try but he

00:02:12,909 --> 00:02:15,909
didn't really have a reason to do it

00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:18,370
other than he wanted to give it a try

00:02:15,909 --> 00:02:20,940
and so he decided he would

00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:24,010
flying at home kind of a weekend project

00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:26,650
apparently he has a henhouse and had

00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:28,599
some problems and that some bird was

00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,790
entering the henhouse and pecking the

00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:32,409
eggs before he could get to it so he

00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,659
thought he could set up an image

00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:37,299
recognition system that would detect

00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:40,120
this whoever was coming in and pecking

00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:42,340
the eggs and that gave him a way to save

00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,049
his eggs and more importantly an excuse

00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,709
for getting to play around a little with

00:02:44,049 --> 00:02:47,920
tensorflow

00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:50,140
and that's what he built so he basically

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,540
trained how model to be able to

00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,750
recognize these different images he had

00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:57,760
two kinds of chickens in his henhouse

00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:00,609
Rhode Island red something called a Buff

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,680
Orpington conv an odd name and he

00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:05,230
suspected that what was coming in and

00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:07,269
pecking the eggs with a J so he needed

00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,609
to train on these three things and this

00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:11,709
is how he basically labeled the

00:03:09,609 --> 00:03:14,409
detection the classification categories

00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:16,060
he was looking for now what kind of

00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:17,829
lessons can we learn from this well

00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:19,569
first of all he's doing image

00:03:17,829 --> 00:03:22,810
recognition but what really matters for

00:03:19,569 --> 00:03:24,160
this project is essentially this it's a

00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:26,019
chicken or it's not a chicken

00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,870
that's what mattered to him and most

00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:31,480
importantly in this situation this one

00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:33,040
was potentially a predator and that gets

00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,440
to the first lesson you can take from

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,239
this toy project domain knowledge really

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,370
does matter you have to know a little

00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:41,139
not just about the model you have to

00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,000
know a little about the system are you

00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:45,040
asking the right question what's going

00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,620
to bring you value he had to know to

00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,829
know what to train what images to train

00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:52,900
on a forehand to realize that this was

00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:54,519
actually a Western scrub J and he could

00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,280
get lots of images of scrub jays and

00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:59,139
that's what he did so this pursuit never

00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,060
done machine learning very successfully

00:03:59,139 --> 00:04:04,569
built this mom he wrote a nice little

00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:06,459
blog about it and he did a lot of things

00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:09,340
right there good lessons in this for

00:04:06,459 --> 00:04:11,199
even more important projects he gathered

00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,180
a lot of training data he had thousand

00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:16,989
several thousand images of each type of

00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:18,280
bird he trained a tensorflow model but

00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:20,320
he didn't have to build it all from

00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,479
scratch he took advantage of an

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,910
inception v3 model that was basically

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,979
already constructed and so someone else

00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,450
had done the heavy lifting that's why he

00:04:26,979 --> 00:04:30,190
didn't have to have that intense

00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:31,530
background as a data scientist to be

00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:34,320
able to build a model

00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:36,960
so image recognition deep learning is

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,820
very complicated very sophisticated but

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,070
fortunately now there are some models

00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:44,610
where somebody can come in and basically

00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:47,030
get the images to train a prebuilt model

00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:50,040
and this is what he did so he had

00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:52,440
deployed into his in-house he had a way

00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,410
to deploy this in a practical way he had

00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,510
a camera so it motion capture ran a

00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,820
program for that had pre trained on

00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:01,680
these images he set up his systems that

00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:04,230
he had a way that he could retrain the

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,410
model if he needed to he deployed this

00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:09,900
right at the IOT edge right next to the

00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:12,390
the IOT sensor data in this case his

00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,400
in-house and his camera he deployed this

00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:17,340
just a little raspberry pi's this very

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,560
simple system and he then needed to make

00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,690
this a practical system he needed what

00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,210
he needed some way to report the results

00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:26,640
to report the results so he had an

00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:27,660
output that went to a Twitter feed

00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,750
called

00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,210
apt tensor chicken she's got all the

00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:35,760
pieces there how well did it work how

00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:38,790
can we tell if it's success well first

00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:40,470
of all oops I'm going to go back first

00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,700
of all you can look at this tensor I

00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,470
don't know if you can read this tiny

00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,479
print but it's kind of dark but they're

00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:48,000
two different examples here one of this

00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:49,890
Rhode Island red in one of this Buff

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,510
Orpington picture and if you can

00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:53,460
actually see the results he reported

00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,770
that live results in this feed on on

00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:57,720
Twitter you can see that the model was

00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:00,300
correctly classifying these images at

00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,680
very high accuracy could recognize this

00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,000
as being in Rhode Island red it

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,800
recognized that as being a Buff

00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,870
Orpington I didn't get a picture where

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,940
he had a J coming in but it was a really

00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:11,040
efficient system so it looked like a

00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:14,130
roaring success it certainly was a

00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,169
success that his original intent was to

00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:18,270
try this and see if he could do it and

00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:20,190
and have some fun with it and that part

00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:22,950
worked great so it was working really

00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:24,660
really well it's an efficient model but

00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:27,750
here are some other questions he could

00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:29,160
ask I was talking to him and I said

00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,590
because he was to actually trying to

00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,870
stop something from pecking eggs I said

00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:35,820
how long does it take for that image

00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,530
recognition for that classification to

00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:40,740
happen it's just running a raspberry pi

00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:43,349
is said about 30 seconds for it to

00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:45,190
classify an image so how does it take

00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:47,980
for a blue jay to peck an egg

00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:50,950
well the answer is less than 30 seconds

00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:52,870
so do we see a problem with this now as

00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:56,320
you think about this in a practical way

00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:59,740
he has basically a requirement in SLA to

00:06:56,320 --> 00:07:02,140
have some response faster than this bird

00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:04,030
is going to peck an egg this isn't going

00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,930
to work now I was just asking him for

00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:07,000
fun

00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:10,030
turns out I think he got inspired he

00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,240
works for map our mapper has a wonderful

00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:15,820
system where you can build or deploy a

00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,070
really small footprint map or cluster

00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:20,680
right at the the edge so you can do edge

00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,060
computing for IOT data and so he was

00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,350
going to put that in his hen house I

00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:25,210
don't know if he ever actually did that

00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:30,250
but he had figured he could get this

00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:32,140
down to a response time that was so fast

00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,390
it was ridiculous by doing it that way

00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:36,250
is he said a bit of over engineering for

00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:38,950
a simple project there's actually a

00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:41,500
lesson than that too for a lot of things

00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:43,870
you do need something to be fast enough

00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:46,180
to meet your practical requirement but

00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:48,250
faster all by itself is not better if

00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:50,560
it's fast enough and then you spend time

00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:53,350
trying to make a model run faster and

00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,680
faster that's kind of wasted effort so

00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:58,210
again be very aware what the actual

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,130
requirements are what fits what you need

00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:02,590
to do to be able to get value if you're

00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:05,080
doing this in a practical way there was

00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:06,340
a separate issue I said what are you

00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,260
gonna do if you get it running fast

00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:10,690
enough and you can actually detect that

00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:13,540
a predator has come in how are you going

00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:15,610
to scare it away hmm they haven't quite

00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:17,350
figured that part out yet we had a

00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,930
little fun thinking of various horrible

00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:21,220
things you could do to scare a bird away

00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:23,980
unfortunately most most of those would

00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:25,870
also make your hands not lay eggs what's

00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:28,030
basically been the outcome of this is

00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:30,640
that ian has gone on he's changed the

00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:32,080
tensor chicken-out output on Twitter I

00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,120
see he's now trying to identify

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,610
different types of hummingbirds and

00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,979
hummingbird feeders were fun he's gone

00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:41,410
on with it but there really are in this

00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:43,870
to a example some important lessons that

00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:45,520
apply for real-world situations by the

00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:47,740
way I mentioned earlier that domain

00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,180
knowledge matters and it does you need

00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,070
to know a lot about the the subject

00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,690
matter somewhere in the middle of the

00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:54,490
night when I was writing this up for a

00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:56,260
reporter or chapter in a book because

00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:58,240
I've thought this as a fun story I

00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:58,860
started thinking about the fact that the

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,330
name

00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:04,210
Orpington Orpingtons a weird name but

00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:07,450
it's I think someplace in England but

00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:12,130
buff in English generally means a light

00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:14,530
tan kind of even golden color so this

00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:16,720
pretty little black chicken with white

00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:19,360
spots didn't sound like buff in anything

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,980
and I got curious and you can waste a

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,570
lot of time when you have a chapter due

00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:24,280
and you should be doing something else

00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:26,890
so I started looking for images of

00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,810
chickens on Google and I discovered that

00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:31,780
what a Buff Orpington chicken looks like

00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:33,370
actually is this somebody had sold him

00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:35,260
eggs they told him what kinds of

00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:38,620
chickens they were turns out that wasn't

00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:40,150
true and so I contacted an I thought it

00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,560
was hilarious and said I think you have

00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:45,100
a different kind of chicken it turned

00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:47,020
out to be called a Plymouth Rock the

00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,490
chicken that he had well it turns out he

00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,900
actually went back and retrained his

00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,520
model because he wanted to see if he

00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,050
could get it to work and it's wonderful

00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,640
you could watch in the evaluation of the

00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:57,400
bottles as one changes and the other

00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,280
comes up again a good lesson in a toy a

00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:03,310
toy project but there's also a lesson

00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:05,020
here he was embarrassed he had his

00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:07,600
chicken labeled wrong but for the

00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:09,190
purposes of that project if you think

00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,730
about it as being trying to identify a

00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:14,410
predator again this becomes over

00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:16,690
engineering you don't need if it's wrong

00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:18,400
and that's too bad but all that mattered

00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:20,170
is that you can say it's a chicken and

00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,910
it's not the predator so it actually

00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,770
didn't matter that he had it named wrong

00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:26,940
in terms of how the project was supposed

00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:29,470
to work so these are some of the serious

00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:32,380
lessons that come out of this incredibly

00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:34,060
simple project one I haven't mentioned

00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:37,000
and I think maybe it's the most

00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:40,350
important one is that there is a very

00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,760
important role for data engineering in

00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,080
machine learning systems and I think

00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:47,050
people are really increasingly

00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:49,540
recognizing that for these systems to

00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:51,820
work in a real-world situation to

00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:54,100
actually be deployed in a sustainable

00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:56,050
and reasonable way into production it's

00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:59,140
absolutely important that you're able to

00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:01,450
handle the logistics of gathering data

00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:04,410
training getting the training data for a

00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:07,150
model adjusting data that's input data

00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:09,130
later as the model is deployed into

00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:10,780
production how do you keep all of this

00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,990
system running how do you manage the

00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:14,630
models there

00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:17,480
water places where the characteristics

00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:20,029
that the the skills that a person has as

00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,560
a software engineer add to that some

00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:24,260
data skills and this becomes a very

00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:27,020
powerful profession right now to be a

00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:29,000
data engineer and so there's a real role

00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,470
for that in this case it's a little

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,940
unusual because ian was doing this

00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:35,029
project on his own because of that

00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:37,339
convenience of a pre-made model the

00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:39,470
inception v3 tensorflow model that he

00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:41,690
could just customize and there's a hint

00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,700
to in some cases the simple model

00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:45,260
actually works very well if it fits what

00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,420
you're trying to do in a situation and

00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:49,820
sometimes a data engineer can do this

00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:52,130
and you don't always need a PhD level

00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:53,930
data scientist for all of this but even

00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:55,880
projects they're very complicated where

00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:58,160
you really need a serious data science

00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,800
team there's a huge role for the data

00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,660
engineer but the part that I signed this

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,790
that I found the most interesting is

00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:07,310
that for these things to work in the

00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:10,520
real world you need the data engineers

00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:12,529
to be excited about doing this work and

00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:14,240
was really fired up about this I mean he

00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:16,820
spent some time he got this going on his

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,620
own it's exciting to him to see how

00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,959
these projects work and to be an

00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:23,480
integral part of it and that carries

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,640
over to real-world situation so before

00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:28,070
we go forward I have a few questions for

00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,980
you the audience how many people in here

00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:33,680
are working now or have recently worked

00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:37,310
on machine learning projects can we see

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,570
a show of hands just about everybody how

00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:43,490
many people in here would call

00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:45,380
themselves data scientists some of you

00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,450
not all of you how many see them

00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:50,660
yourselves more as an engineer has a

00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:52,790
data engineer for in that role so again

00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:55,459
a mix how many people came because

00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:58,220
they're interested in chickens no okay

00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:59,990
just a second all right so as you can

00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:02,000
see there's a mix even in this audience

00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:04,100
and I think that really is the formula

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,350
for success as we see that those roles

00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,060
need to work together the data engineer

00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:10,100
takes a lot of the pressure off of the

00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,990
data scientist to make sure that these

00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,390
aspects of a project are done correctly

00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:15,829
the data scientist is supplying that

00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:17,959
expertise for the model and the

00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:20,270
algorithm itself those things need to

00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:23,870
work together so let's look at some real

00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:25,510
world examples and the first one is also

00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:27,370
an example where

00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:29,140
it's nothing only importance about it

00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:31,300
but it's also an example where the

00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:36,029
domain knowledge matters this is a

00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:39,820
situation where a person had built a

00:13:36,029 --> 00:13:41,680
video recommendation system the person

00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:44,170
doing this was the data scientist knew a

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,830
lot about algorithm central so forth

00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:50,830
but it actually does matter to be aware

00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:52,360
of how are you posing your question are

00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,760
you using the right data you're trying

00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,980
to see the preferences of people

00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,779
watching these videos and so if you say

00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:00,790
is a model success you're evaluating

00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:03,550
that model is a model successful does it

00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:06,670
perform well then you say is it actually

00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:08,589
able to identify preferences and and say

00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:11,830
these are the outstanding things and it

00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:13,480
did very very well except in the end it

00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:15,490
wasn't a good recommender in terms of

00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:19,390
the audience because it was originally

00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:23,860
trained on using clicks on these videos

00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:26,260
and if you think about it what clicks on

00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,360
videos tell you is it tells you how well

00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:30,670
people like the title of the video

00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:32,410
that's what captures their attention if

00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:34,060
you want a better recommender you have

00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:36,310
to actually look at the first few

00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:37,900
seconds of a viewing in this case 30

00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:40,029
seconds turned out to be a good number

00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:42,430
and now you're actually being able to

00:14:40,029 --> 00:14:44,380
gauge that behavior is now telling you

00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:46,150
something about the person's preference

00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,760
for the video as opposed to whether

00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:50,920
there's catchy title so it's not a

00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,990
change in the algorithm it's a change in

00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,450
making the right choice about that input

00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:57,310
data this was a real business it made a

00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:59,320
tremendous amount of difference for the

00:14:57,310 --> 00:15:02,160
business to make that small adjustment

00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:04,570
so these things really do matter

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,180
another example that comes from a real

00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:09,339
world situation is a person who is an

00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:13,089
expert in security for financial

00:15:09,339 --> 00:15:15,820
institutions and in one situation he had

00:15:13,089 --> 00:15:19,000
been saving all of the the headers for

00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:20,740
website interactions and saving more

00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,110
detail than you think that you might

00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:25,300
want and it wasn't because he was

00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:27,700
looking for any specific thing he just

00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:30,610
wanted the best possible records of what

00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:32,470
normal behavior looks like what normal

00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:35,320
behavior looks like interacting with

00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:37,839
this website now why was he interested

00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,370
in normal behavior because of course he

00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,580
wanted to be able to

00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:44,900
abnormal behavior he wanted to see those

00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:47,540
outliers as they happen and that's

00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:49,730
exactly what happened here so the lesson

00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:52,040
here to look for is this person is

00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:54,170
actually very sophisticated in his

00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:57,080
ability to do this I think I'm allowed

00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:58,940
to he works for map R now we've known

00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,010
him for years he was actually one of the

00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:03,200
people who helped track down what

00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:05,840
happened in these believe it's called

00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:09,290
ababeel attacks several years ago which

00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:11,990
were very serious large-scale attacks by

00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:14,060
a foreign entity so this is somebody

00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:16,430
with a lot of experience and very

00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:18,710
sophisticated in this field but it turns

00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:21,140
out in this situation what actually

00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:23,780
mattered is something in itself that's

00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:26,540
incredibly simple and it is simply

00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:30,110
noticing the difference in the ordering

00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:33,470
of these elements in these headers now

00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:35,420
the normal situation on their right here

00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:37,970
the real request differs from the

00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:40,610
attacker request but this difference

00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:43,190
this behavior is not something in itself

00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:44,930
that would interfere with function it's

00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:46,880
not something even a sophisticated

00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:48,890
person could predict it's not something

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,750
you can look for okay

00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:52,850
you wouldn't know which piece of this to

00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:55,910
look for but the point is simply that

00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:57,380
it's different it shows up not as normal

00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:59,390
behavior because it isn't normal

00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,310
behavior it's about doing something is

00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:03,950
not a human and this makes a big

00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:06,500
difference and another example in this

00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:08,330
case the attacker request now on the

00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,730
other side is a difference in whether

00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:13,070
you start these lines with a capital

00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:15,050
letter or small letter why I'm showing

00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:17,780
you these examples are these are

00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:20,560
situations where again having some

00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:22,730
domain understanding it's not so much a

00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,860
sophistication this is fairly simple

00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:27,080
modeling to do that you have to know

00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:29,720
what to look for or have systems that

00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:33,350
are ready to look for things the other

00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:38,120
lesson here is that you have to be able

00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:39,980
to preserve data even in some cases

00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,560
where you don't know exactly how it will

00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:45,290
be needed later and what aspects of that

00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,460
data are important in one situation may

00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:49,790
be the parts you would have thrown away

00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:51,770
so raw data is really very valuable for

00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,750
machine learning obviously it's going to

00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,970
be processed

00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:57,430
gonna add various things to it as you

00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:59,710
develop data for training as you develop

00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:02,380
input data for model but if you can

00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:04,030
preserve raw data you can't preserve

00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:06,040
everything but to whatever extent you

00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:07,750
can preserve raw data that gives you

00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:10,240
some really powerful options in the

00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:12,700
future as you start to do new new

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,140
projects new systems or even within the

00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,580
system you're working on as you realize

00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,070
something that you might have thrown

00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:21,340
away as a feature actually matters and

00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:24,250
fortunately really good really efficient

00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:26,260
modern distributed systems make it

00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:28,300
possible to do that to store that data

00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:31,510
and get access to it and for people to

00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:33,100
do it really in in even large companies

00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:35,260
that are distributed across different

00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:37,000
locations you don't always know what

00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,740
you're going to need and yet it's pretty

00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,080
easy to get access to that kind of

00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:43,570
comprehensive view of data when you need

00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,790
it now that's different from trying to

00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:47,620
preserve data that's the actual data are

00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:49,180
using for training a model and we'll

00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:52,750
talk about that a little later that has

00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:56,050
another practical value let's switch to

00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:59,020
one more real-world system there's a lot

00:18:56,050 --> 00:19:02,710
of machine learning being done and areas

00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:06,310
where big industrial systems certainly

00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:08,410
where IOT data is being produced some of

00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:10,930
the examples I've given you so far as to

00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:13,180
say that what can make a machine

00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:17,560
learning project successful and very

00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:19,450
valuable is actually the knowledge that

00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:21,670
you put into it are you asking the right

00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:24,970
question sometimes the model itself is

00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:26,500
fairly simple not that hard to build can

00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:28,750
you deploy it in the right way those can

00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,760
have huge impact but certainly there are

00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:34,530
these other systems where that model is

00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:36,400
very very complicated one of the

00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:39,760
examples that gets the most attention

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:43,180
lately or people working with autonomous

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:45,220
cars those are not simple kind of

00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:48,220
decision processes for a machine

00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:51,280
learning model in those cases you're not

00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:52,990
looking for just a right answer let's

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,670
take the example you're driving up the

00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:56,560
road your system comes back and tells

00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:58,390
your car make a right turn at this

00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,860
intersection now if you have a

00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:01,450
navigation system and that's a

00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:04,120
reasonable route to where you're going

00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:06,730
saying TURN RIGHT might be the right

00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:09,010
answer if there happens to be a bus

00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:10,780
or a pothole or a small child standing

00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:13,240
in the way turning right at that moment

00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:15,429
is very much not the right answer those

00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,650
are systems that are complicated they

00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:20,380
have to process data very effectively

00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:22,510
process it in real time it's an

00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:25,150
interactive system where basically

00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:27,220
you're constantly getting data adjusting

00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:29,530
the the choices and the insights those

00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:31,510
are very complicated systems they're

00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:33,090
very very valuable and there are a

00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:35,890
number of different areas where you see

00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:38,500
modeling like that being done certainly

00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:40,270
in transportation throughout the medical

00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:43,600
industry people are also beginning to

00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:46,990
use machine learning AI in situations in

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,610
medical research in other situations

00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:52,450
that are therapeutic where we're

00:20:48,610 --> 00:20:55,000
assisting human driven decisions by

00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:57,280
initial analysis of images for example

00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,429
not something simple like chickens and

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:03,130
Blue Jays but much more complicated

00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:05,860
images where you're assisting histology

00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:09,040
and so forth scannings

00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:12,040
MRIs and and being able to supply that

00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:16,179
data back to the doctor so that she or

00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:18,460
he can more easily make a decision in a

00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:20,650
decision about the patient so there's

00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,390
some very very complicated examples

00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:25,150
especially in this world and especially

00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:28,030
in the world of large scale industry and

00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:30,340
machinery manufacturing is changing

00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:33,040
completely right now it's making itself

00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:36,120
into something new an example that I've

00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:39,130
seen recently is up in northern England

00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:41,320
UK has set up a research center called

00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:44,500
the advanced manufacturing research

00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:45,790
center or a MRC and they're doing a lot

00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,460
of research where they're actually

00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:50,679
taking in production systems with a

00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:52,210
hundred or 200 big companies I think

00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:53,980
Boeing is the one that's been the most

00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,900
prominent so their name is attached with

00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:59,200
it and they're putting that in direct

00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:01,240
contact with the the latest sort of

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,220
state-of-the-art engineering knowledge

00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,919
from the University and these are

00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:08,110
systems where the engineers are

00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,720
literally sitting right on the floor of

00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:14,049
a reconfigurable factory called a

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,450
factory 20 50 it's a wonderful example

00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:18,909
where at every level of the process from

00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:20,169
planning actual production coming in

00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:23,200
testing a lot of

00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:27,129
for automotive a lot of it is for things

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:29,470
in the aerospace industry there are

00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:31,450
other examples as well but these are

00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:33,100
being put you know a very short pipeline

00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:35,019
between research and new ideas

00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:37,539
innovation directly into what's

00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:40,419
happening in in these companies and

00:22:37,539 --> 00:22:43,869
they're training up people who are able

00:22:40,419 --> 00:22:44,980
to work with basically smart tools I

00:22:43,869 --> 00:22:46,989
mean you have all these sophisticated

00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,730
ideas coming out and somebody's going to

00:22:46,989 --> 00:22:50,739
work on the assembly line who's actually

00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:54,549
going to be able to do that so these

00:22:50,739 --> 00:22:56,919
systems are changing very fast certainly

00:22:54,549 --> 00:22:58,509
there's practical value in that now

00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:00,220
having said that I'm going to turn

00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:02,200
around and show you a system that's just

00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:06,399
the obvious opposite it's in the same

00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:10,710
industry or in the same arena all of

00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:13,470
these situations whether you have a

00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:16,080
telecommunications company you have

00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:18,879
manufacturing you have large-scale

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,950
transportation you have people in the

00:23:18,879 --> 00:23:23,649
oil and gas industry and all of these

00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:26,739
situations very sophisticated businesses

00:23:23,649 --> 00:23:29,529
but they're businesses and they have all

00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:32,409
the basic challenges and issues of basic

00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:34,450
business processes after track what's

00:23:32,409 --> 00:23:36,220
going on with the business they need to

00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:38,470
track metrics of what's working or not

00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:40,869
if they're also customer facing they

00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:43,059
need to track aspects of their impact

00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:45,429
customer relations customer services

00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:47,590
what happens with marketing and what do

00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:51,309
all of these companies have in common

00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:52,539
is billing and revenue and that makes a

00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:55,179
big difference so we're talking about

00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:57,850
practical situations that have can have

00:23:55,179 --> 00:24:01,059
huge impact in huge value and it turns

00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:04,059
out one of the greatest skills that a

00:24:01,059 --> 00:24:06,039
data scientist can have is not just that

00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:08,919
sophistication of the algorithm in the

00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:11,590
model but it's the ability to look at

00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:14,889
these businesses to recognize those

00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:18,309
places where using machine learning can

00:24:14,889 --> 00:24:21,359
optimize or automate a step and if that

00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:24,429
step can have tremendous impact actual

00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:27,909
value to the system to the company

00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:30,960
that's a really ripe place for machine

00:24:27,909 --> 00:24:33,520
learning and so again they're not the

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,750
examples that I think get written up

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,540
right now with all these very

00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:38,700
sophisticated AI systems they can be

00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,570
very simple or they could be

00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:42,640
sophisticated but they can make a

00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:45,760
tremendous difference so in one

00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:48,520
particular case this is a large industry

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:52,360
I can't say which one but it happens to

00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:53,740
be a manpower customer but they have to

00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,470
deal with a tremendous amount of

00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:58,930
machinery and they're looking they're

00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:02,110
having to track and label various

00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:04,840
actions that were taken supplies repairs

00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:07,840
that were done deliverables out to other

00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,370
customers they also have to track parts

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,020
and equipment that are brought in and

00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:13,960
parts that are being moved into

00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:15,490
different parts of the company so all of

00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,350
this has to be tracked it's not the

00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:20,350
exciting part of this business but it's

00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:23,740
very important and it gets each item

00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:25,810
each system each action gets labeled now

00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:28,030
what happens if those labels are applied

00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:29,800
incorrectly or somebody gets in a hurry

00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:32,080
and they just put miscellaneous on a

00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:35,110
label well I can have a tremendous

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,440
impact because the way these different

00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:40,060
actions and parts are labeled is

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,370
actually determines whether they're

00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:46,990
taxed it determines whether they can be

00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:49,180
written back against expenses basically

00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:51,520
it's something that determines whether

00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:53,290
they're billable out to another another

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,840
client is a part of their revenue stream

00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:57,490
this is the tremendous difference to the

00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,350
business and yet it's a very simple step

00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:01,480
it's being done all over the business by

00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:04,000
a lot of people and often these pieces

00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,920
are mislabeled and so we had a data

00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,460
scientist who came in talked to people

00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:12,910
there figured out that that simple step

00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:15,010
of mislabelling sometimes mislabeling or

00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:17,860
just generically labeling things as

00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:21,040
miscellaneous was causing this company

00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:23,740
to miss out on the opportunity of saving

00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:27,970
or collecting tens of millions of

00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:30,880
dollars and so he set up an automated

00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:34,360
system not to change the labels but

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:37,210
basically a detection system to look for

00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:41,170
patterns that would alert people in an

00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:43,030
audit to classes of these labels that

00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:46,030
look potentially like they might be

00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:47,290
mislabeled so that reduces the auditing

00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:48,760
to focus into

00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:51,580
get in on the things that are gonna make

00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:53,560
a difference so this was done it was

00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:56,680
done fairly quickly and through that

00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:58,840
simple step of recognizing those steps

00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:01,030
within a business where a decision

00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,590
process where there's a bottleneck where

00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:05,610
there's an error something that

00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:09,190
automating could make that worthwhile

00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:11,830
literally was worth tens of millions of

00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:13,930
dollars for this company and the

00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:16,180
specifics have to do with that company

00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:17,560
but that pattern that situation you

00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:19,570
would find in a lot of different

00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:21,580
companies and so if you're really

00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:24,270
looking at how to make machine learning

00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:26,860
valuable how to make a system a success

00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:30,430
again it isn't always about the

00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:32,980
algorithm itself but it's about what you

00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:35,410
build around it does it fit into the

00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:37,210
business is your is your successful

00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:39,730
model running like an engine that's out

00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:42,070
of gear is it connected into a real

00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:43,960
action that you can take now let's take

00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:46,210
that last thought of is it connected to

00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:49,030
a real action you can take let's jump

00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:51,700
back to the idea of our friend with the

00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:52,870
henhouse and the image recognition we

00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:54,730
said he hadn't thought through what

00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:57,490
action would you take to be able to

00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:59,530
scare away a blue jay that was the

00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:01,570
missing action he had an action that

00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:04,000
some people say oh my machine learning

00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:06,430
system is set up to have an actionable

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,640
step at the end but what they're seeing

00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:11,500
is an actionable step is a report I mean

00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:16,000
in his case it was reporting the stuff

00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:17,350
to tensor chicken a report is not it's

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,650
good you need to track what's happening

00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:22,360
but just reporting what's going on isn't

00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:24,160
really an actionable step it doesn't

00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,870
connect you to things that will bring

00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,640
that real business value I see somebody

00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:30,730
nodding I suspect you have run into this

00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:32,260
in the real world jumping back to this

00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:34,510
example that happened with the

00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:36,040
large-scale industry what was another

00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:38,830
thing that was cool about that example

00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:40,600
is not just that they detected that

00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:42,400
there could be errors but it was set in

00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:44,530
a way that was practical for their flow

00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,150
of business so that they could have you

00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:48,760
know basically human audits that could

00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:51,250
then go in and and take an action take a

00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:54,610
change and save their money so it is

00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:58,480
really the responsibility of people on

00:28:54,610 --> 00:29:01,010
the the data science team the data

00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,540
engineering data scientists together

00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:04,280
either they need to see where those

00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,810
actions can be taken or they need to be

00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,760
able to communicate with people within

00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:09,470
the business who are the ones who have

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:11,090
will be able to take the action or

00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:13,370
identify it for them you need to work

00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:15,350
together and identify that and if you

00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:17,900
don't do that really what you're doing

00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:19,190
is kind of a fun weekend project it

00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:21,110
might be a little bigger than a weekend

00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:22,520
project if it's for a business but it's

00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:26,030
not going to bring those practical

00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:27,680
results now making a shift I've been

00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:30,470
saying that one of the things that

00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,750
matters the most for machine learning to

00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:35,330
work is not just the algorithm or the

00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:37,910
model itself but it's the logistics the

00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:39,470
data managing models all of that

00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:42,800
together and connected into real

00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:44,240
business action when you talk to people

00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,700
about what's the most important machine

00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,880
learning tool we find that people use a

00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:51,470
lot of different tools it's not to say

00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,480
they're all equal but most people doing

00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:56,510
this successfully have four or five or

00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,390
six different machine learning tools to

00:29:56,510 --> 00:30:00,800
actually build algorithm that they like

00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:03,830
another little I'm curious about the

00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:08,720
audience always your experience so I'll

00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:10,790
just say is anybody in here used h2o no

00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,310
I'm surprised no one I recommend that to

00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:14,780
people it's it's a great system for

00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:20,230
really good for deep learning for other

00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:24,110
things as well it makes net tensorflow

00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:26,210
cafe its show of hands there there are a

00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:28,430
lot of different tools and new ones will

00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:30,200
keep coming most people hat keep a kind

00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:32,900
of a toolkit or several tools but in

00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:34,880
some ways the single tool that matters

00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:37,640
the most because it supports all of

00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,050
those and it supports that next machine

00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,760
learning specific tool that you're going

00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:43,720
to add you know next year that you don't

00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:46,490
know about yet is to have the platform

00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:48,680
capabilities that actually handle the

00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:51,470
logistics and handle them in an

00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:53,960
efficient and consistent way especially

00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:55,730
in a large business across different

00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,500
systems because you don't want to have

00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:59,660
to build all of these from scratch for

00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:01,370
every system and that again are the

00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:04,100
places where you can actually bring this

00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:06,710
kind of practical success it makes a big

00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:08,990
difference so in some ways it's really

00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:10,840
the logistics that make the biggest

00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:13,790
difference from machine learning to work

00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:14,429
now with that in mind this isn't the

00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,899
only way to

00:31:14,429 --> 00:31:18,470
do it but I want to throw a thought out

00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:21,149
there plant a thought is streaming is an

00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:24,029
incredibly powerful way to build an

00:31:21,149 --> 00:31:27,240
architecture streaming matters because

00:31:24,029 --> 00:31:29,340
it supports micro-services I think I

00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,840
misread that little time signal so I'm

00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:32,279
going to speed up here I was slowing

00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:36,690
down because I thought it was incredibly

00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:38,249
slow streaming is at the heart of can be

00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:40,559
at the heart of an architecture it's not

00:31:38,249 --> 00:31:42,659
just for real-time applications and what

00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,700
really matters is the stream transport

00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:47,549
system if you want to do micro services

00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:50,309
you need a stream transport system in

00:31:47,549 --> 00:31:52,499
the style of Kafka Apache Kafka example

00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:54,570
now for streams is an example where

00:31:52,499 --> 00:31:56,570
you're not broadcasting the results to a

00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:59,190
group of consumers but they're actually

00:31:56,570 --> 00:32:01,409
subscribing it and it's at decoupling

00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:02,909
between producers and consumers and

00:32:01,409 --> 00:32:05,610
between consumers and each other

00:32:02,909 --> 00:32:07,590
that really matter the message is there

00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:09,570
it's ready to be consumed immediately

00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:11,759
that's good for real-time it doesn't

00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:13,529
have to be used right away the consumer

00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:15,749
doesn't have to be online and that's

00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:19,019
what gives you that kind of independence

00:32:15,749 --> 00:32:21,659
that really is at the heart of micro

00:32:19,019 --> 00:32:23,669
services so you can use streams as the

00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:26,580
lightweight connectors between micro

00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:29,460
services so holding that idea in mind

00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:30,899
also want to remind you that I think

00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:33,360
most people in here do machine learning

00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:34,950
so this is not news but people think

00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,779
that you know in machine learning

00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:38,850
involves building the model obviously

00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:40,860
involves building a lot of models often

00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:43,710
hundreds of models and you have to have

00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:45,210
some way to handle it the management the

00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:48,600
deployment of those models the

00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:52,289
evaluation and also the data that you're

00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:54,360
using and so really the logistics can be

00:32:52,289 --> 00:32:56,369
very challenging you're using data from

00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,259
many different data sources obviously a

00:32:56,369 --> 00:32:59,820
big scale you have a lot of different

00:32:58,259 --> 00:33:01,980
models that you need to be able to

00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:03,929
handle you want to be able to evaluate

00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:06,509
them model to model in an effective way

00:33:03,929 --> 00:33:09,269
but a good style is to also be able to

00:33:06,509 --> 00:33:11,279
have a number of good enough models

00:33:09,269 --> 00:33:13,619
they're already up and running they're

00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:15,059
basically waiting in the wings and when

00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:17,159
you want to deploy them into production

00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:19,889
you can roll it out and indeed roll it

00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:21,749
back if you need to essentially a system

00:33:19,889 --> 00:33:25,289
where all you have to do to deploy a new

00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:27,330
model is not to fire it up but simply to

00:33:25,289 --> 00:33:28,340
stop ignoring it you've been saying wait

00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:30,070
wait wait now you

00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:32,419
say go and this gives you tremendous

00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:34,460
flexibility now there's more than one

00:33:32,419 --> 00:33:36,440
way to do that but one of the systems

00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:39,230
that we've talked about is what's called

00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:41,840
a rendezvous architecture Ted Dunning

00:33:39,230 --> 00:33:44,179
who's here in the front row and I wrote

00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:47,150
a short book about this last year called

00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:49,309
machine learning logistics and we talked

00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:51,590
about this system which is based on the

00:33:49,309 --> 00:33:53,900
idea of streaming micro services we're

00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:55,880
actually using streams not only to have

00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:58,669
those advantages of handling data or

00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:02,029
adding you know whatever you need to raw

00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:03,529
data to really build input data for for

00:34:02,029 --> 00:34:05,899
models but you're looking at a whole

00:34:03,529 --> 00:34:08,210
system of models you build a rendezvous

00:34:05,899 --> 00:34:10,429
server and that server is constantly

00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:12,800
making decisions it's seeing the input

00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:15,050
it's looking at the output scores from

00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,389
all of the different models and requests

00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:19,940
by request it's basically making a

00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:22,520
decision of what is the best choice in

00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:25,990
that moment for that single request

00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:28,940
what's the best system to fit a set of

00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:31,300
basically pre-configured SLA is you've

00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:33,830
determined what constitutes the right

00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:35,659
choices for that moment and it's

00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:37,970
constantly making that decision so it

00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:39,830
can roll one model in one model back

00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:42,500
gives you that enormous amount of

00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:44,389
flexibility so it's really looking at

00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,770
the scores looking at the request by

00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:48,440
request looking at all these different

00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:50,300
models and making that decision that's

00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,909
what's at the heart of this rendezvous

00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:54,470
approach as I said we wrote about it in

00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:57,200
this book I'll give you that contact

00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:59,750
information at the end one of the things

00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,520
to point out about this system is that

00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:05,869
it is very important to be able to

00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:08,530
identify input model data for a model

00:35:05,869 --> 00:35:11,869
exactly so we recommend running a decoy

00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:13,369
model this is looks like a real model it

00:35:11,869 --> 00:35:15,109
takes the input data it doesn't do

00:35:13,369 --> 00:35:17,030
anything with it it just archives in

00:35:15,109 --> 00:35:18,890
that might not be a good idea if you

00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:21,230
didn't have complete Independence of the

00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:23,060
microservices but in this kind of system

00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:25,310
you do that gives you a very valuable

00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:27,470
record of what was used as input data

00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:30,020
that combined with me able to deploy

00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:32,540
models into containers you have a way to

00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:34,670
to test and retest things evaluate them

00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:35,300
in very predictable and reproducible

00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:37,609
systems

00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:40,070
another aspect of the rendezvous system

00:35:37,609 --> 00:35:41,960
is to have what's called a canary model

00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:44,060
and so the canary model ISM

00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:46,040
godless deployed into production it's

00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:48,680
doing well it gives you a kind of

00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:50,869
baseline for what is reasonable adequate

00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,820
performance if you roll a new model out

00:35:50,869 --> 00:35:55,790
you can actually quickly do a comparison

00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:57,859
of the performance of that canary model

00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:59,750
and a new model and that difference you

00:35:57,859 --> 00:36:01,940
want things to be better but if it's two

00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:03,200
different you know that's a flag that

00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:05,800
maybe there's something wrong so it

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,880
gives you a kind of a stabilizer on

00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:10,990
production systems to make sure

00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,990
everything's going pretty well

00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:16,940
so rendezvous says this architecture is

00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:19,670
a really good way to handle machine

00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:22,910
learning logistics for simple systems

00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:25,609
that are basically decisioning where you

00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:27,589
have a yes/no sort of animal yes/no but

00:36:25,609 --> 00:36:29,240
you're looking for a specific answer not

00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:33,770
these kind of complex interactive

00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:35,990
systems such as an autonomous car this

00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:38,510
has also been talked about we wrote an

00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:40,550
entry in the encyclopedia of Big Data

00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:42,740
technologies recently and rendezvous

00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:45,619
architecture also in streaming Micra

00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:49,490
services other things that are happening

00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:51,830
in this area that are new ml flow is

00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:53,720
handling some of the early aspects of

00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:56,030
handling data and so forth input data

00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:58,490
for models a way to handle management

00:36:56,030 --> 00:37:00,890
and logistics that way that one comes

00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:02,570
out of data bricks clipper is coming

00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:05,089
from the rise lab at the University of

00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:07,310
California Berkeley this is a really

00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:09,589
interesting system some of the goals and

00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:12,710
some of the aspects of that design or

00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:14,480
are similar to some of the ways the

00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:18,050
issues that the rendezvous architecture

00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:20,780
are trying to attack things will change

00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:23,349
oh I just want to remind you I think

00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:26,450
there's a slider I missed a slide here

00:37:23,349 --> 00:37:28,550
since Ted talked about rendezvous here

00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:30,560
at buzzwords a year ago was very news

00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:32,300
before we written the book since then

00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,339
several people have implemented this

00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:36,920
some large companies are in the process

00:37:34,339 --> 00:37:38,359
of building the server and so it is

00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,830
something that's happening and there

00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:41,839
been some questions about larger

00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:43,760
projects going together and trying to

00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:45,560
build these so if you have any interest

00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,170
in working on a project to build a

00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:51,800
rendezvous server please contact me or

00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:54,020
contact Ted the last issue here I just

00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,850
want to mention is when you're working

00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:58,220
in systems where you need Fleck

00:37:55,850 --> 00:38:00,950
ability you know you want to be able to

00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:02,660
respond to we don't say if conditions

00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:04,610
change you know they will change that's

00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:06,410
one reason you want a system like

00:38:04,610 --> 00:38:09,140
rendezvous that can role models out

00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:10,670
easily roll them back no matter how good

00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:12,610
a model is and how well it fits a

00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:15,740
situation the outside world will change

00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:18,140
but in addition to the flexibility in

00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:21,140
terms of the design of your dataflow

00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:23,480
workflow the design of the technologies

00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:25,700
that you're using if you have a really

00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:28,220
rigid structure in terms of the human

00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:30,950
interactions that's can still be a

00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:32,750
barrier to success and so I'm talking

00:38:30,950 --> 00:38:36,440
more and more to people who are taking

00:38:32,750 --> 00:38:38,060
an approach of using a style we're

00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,670
calling Dave they're calling data ops

00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:42,920
it's extending the DevOps approach but

00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:44,900
including these data heavy roles like

00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:47,030
data science and data engineering I

00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:51,410
think to a lot of people that sounds

00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:52,610
like fluffy buzzword marketing stuff but

00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:54,350
we've talked to some people who are

00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:56,420
they're consulting companies are almost

00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:59,300
entirely focused on taking big data

00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:01,220
systems into production and one person I

00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:03,230
asked recently really surprised me

00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:05,480
I said what's a single biggest barrier

00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:07,220
to people being successful in production

00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,810
and he said they need to have a data

00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:10,190
office approached it's absolutely not

00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:13,310
what I thought he would pick us the

00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:15,080
that's a central theme this house real

00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:17,120
power despite all the buzzy things

00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:19,970
they're being said about it and it's as

00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:22,370
simple as the fact that you need people

00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:24,710
across these different skills you need

00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:26,990
to breakthrough skill gills you need for

00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:28,940
people to feel that they're part of the

00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:31,970
same project they're focused on the same

00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:33,440
goals and that way somebody with one set

00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:35,290
of skills somebody with another set of

00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,790
skills a data scientist a data engineer

00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:39,650
if they ask for help from each other

00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:41,510
it's not like they're doing a favor

00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:43,970
they've imposed on you know whatever is

00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:46,370
a normal workflow for that person is

00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:48,920
they are part of the same system and

00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:51,080
that change that focus on a shared goal

00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,150
can make a tremendous difference in the

00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:55,520
time to value the efficiency of how

00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:57,740
people work and you can capture some of

00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,140
that excitement that our friend iam

00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:01,700
Downard had as a data engineer when he

00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:04,070
found he was part of a machine learning

00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:07,000
project so that's the most important

00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:09,470
important part of my message today and

00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,840
I'll remind you you'll have

00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:13,160
slides at the end we have this book we

00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,660
had an earlier book where we talked

00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,280
about streaming architecture which is

00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:19,099
the basis for this kind of architecture

00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:21,470
I wrote a book on Apache flink with

00:40:19,099 --> 00:40:23,450
Costa sumus from data artisans I'm a big

00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:25,460
fan of flink so if you want to do some

00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:28,250
fast processing that's a great way to do

00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:30,500
it please help support women in

00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:33,530
technology it's really good not just for

00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:35,450
women but it's good for society and this

00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:36,820
is from one woman in tech I say thank

00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:46,849
you very much
