Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2018: Marton Elek – Docker to kubernetes: running Hadoop in a cloud native way
Publication date: 2018-06-14
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2018 #bbuzz
Description: 
	Creating containers for an application is easy (even if it’s a good old distributed application like Apache Hadoop), just a few steps of packaging. The hard part isn't packaging: it's deploying

How can we run the containers together? How to configure them? How do the services in the containers find and talk to each other? How do you deploy and manage clusters with hundred of nodes?

Modern cloud native tools like Kubernetes or Consul/Nomad could help a lot but they could be used in different way. It this presentation I will demonstrate multiple solutions to manage containerized clusters with different cloud-native tools including kubernetes, and docker-swarm/compose. No matter which tools you use, the same questions of service discovery and configuration management arise. This talk will show the key elements needed to make that containerized cluster work.
