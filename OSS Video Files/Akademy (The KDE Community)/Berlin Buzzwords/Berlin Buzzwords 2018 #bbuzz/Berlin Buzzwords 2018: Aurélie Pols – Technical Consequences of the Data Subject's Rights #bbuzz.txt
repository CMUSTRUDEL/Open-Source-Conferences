Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2018: Aurélie Pols – Technical Consequences of the Data Subject's Rights #bbuzz
Publication date: 2018-06-13
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2018 #bbuzz
Description: 
	In her keynote speech Aurélie will focus on data subject's rights and the technical consequences of these obligations. As the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will be enforced as of May 25th 2018 and replace the current Data Protection Directive, data subject’s rights are being re-introduced and reinforced, building the ground work for a more balanced approach towards data uses within our increasingly digitized societies. 

Aurélie will dive into the practical perspective of how to manage these new GDPR data subject rights, what it means for your processes and IT systems and when or to what type of data they apply.

thank you very much and thank you for

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,750
having me it's it's good to be back in

00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,820
Berlin with such nice weather as well

00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:20,820
yesterday over beers when we were

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,430
enjoying the barbecue somebody said you

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,460
don't like Google very much it was like

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:29,580
well I actually asked questions and I

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:32,090
think questions are important for us to

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,920
understand how we use the technology and

00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:37,019
in that sense I actually stole a slide

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,239
from somebody from Autodesk called

00:00:37,019 --> 00:00:42,120
product who's based in San Francisco and

00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,460
she we both come out of the digital

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,379
analytics industry so I started with

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,860
Google and now it takes a long time ago

00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:52,530
and she had this very nice slide about

00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,720
hunting down vendors and trying to

00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,970
understand what they're up to to make

00:00:54,720 --> 00:01:00,360
sure that you're compliant with the gdpr

00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:03,089
so I like the nice cats basically this

00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:05,250
is also what I do and why I usually wear

00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:08,460
pink because I'm a nice person who just

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:11,160
asks questions to make sure that we're

00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,710
all accountable because it's one of the

00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:16,830
principles of the GDP our article 5.2

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:19,380
where basically we should go towards

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,830
this idea of responsible uses of

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:25,530
information moving beyond just managing

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:28,860
data I think this is important to

00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:32,460
understand and through my entire career

00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:34,830
I've used data I love data I'm terrible

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,740
at coding I found that out very early on

00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:40,920
when I did basic coding at school maybe

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,680
my teacher was just bad but basically I

00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:47,190
like data but I'm also worried about

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,040
what data brings because of the history

00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:52,409
of my family and because most of the

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,110
time I'm also an outlier I do things

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:58,590
differently I live in Spain I speak

00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,920
French I'm Dutch and work in English so

00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:03,479
when we talk for example about

00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,830
differential privacy or ways to

00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,069
anonymize data

00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:10,709
well that outlier is typically me or my

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:13,740
family so this is actually why I care so

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:15,349
much about data but also about making

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,969
sure this is balanced

00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:23,299
with the the European project a couple

00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:26,239
of days ago or last week I was in in

00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:28,099
London for the strata conference where I

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,829
talked for about three and a half hours

00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:33,590
about the GTR so I talked to engineers

00:02:30,829 --> 00:02:36,049
like yourselves data scientists about

00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:38,299
the law and I talked to lawyers about

00:02:36,049 --> 00:02:40,670
technology and usually both of you

00:02:38,299 --> 00:02:43,609
freaked out at some point which is fine

00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:46,129
we just need to have conversations but

00:02:43,609 --> 00:02:50,239
it was interesting to see at strata this

00:02:46,129 --> 00:02:53,510
banner talking about the problem solving

00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,519
problems with data and a week before

00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:58,299
that I was in Brussels talking about

00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,799
ethics and somebody from the

00:02:58,299 --> 00:03:04,519
accountability foundation was talking

00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:07,099
about the fact that he wanted a car that

00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:10,129
could predict when he would have an

00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:12,349
accident because that person is over 70

00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:14,810
years old and well he's getting

00:03:12,349 --> 00:03:16,639
dangerous on the roads and I was sitting

00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:20,359
next to the folks of the commission of

00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:22,849
ethics and we looked at each other and

00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:25,000
we were like driver's license in the

00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:28,759
United States how does that work again

00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,099
did that guy on the road is that a good

00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:34,699
idea actually even if he has a great

00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:39,159
great car and before that I was talking

00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:41,919
also to Sheila of axiom I like axiom

00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:45,019
more than Google but I have to confess

00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:47,150
and she was also talking about certain

00:03:45,019 --> 00:03:50,449
problems that were being solved through

00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:53,689
data and it struck me because these

00:03:50,449 --> 00:03:55,939
problems are not similar to mine and so

00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:59,269
a question that I was wondering is

00:03:55,939 --> 00:04:02,120
whether our values actually influence

00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:04,459
the problems were trying to solve and in

00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,439
that sense certain problems that certain

00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:09,069
entities are trying to solve are maybe

00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:12,739
not the same problems that we have and

00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:15,199
this is also where I think the gdpr is

00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:17,780
the start of a journey where basically

00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,519
we need to think about what we do with

00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:23,030
the data and also the consequence on the

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,919
data and there's an interesting story as

00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:27,270
I said I'm Dutch

00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:30,840
an interesting story in the Netherlands

00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:33,449
where many years ago they wanted to make

00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,150
sure that people were buried according

00:04:33,449 --> 00:04:39,560
to their religious rights and so what

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:43,319
they did is that they created lists of

00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:46,229
people and their religion what happened

00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:49,370
next was world war ii and the invasions

00:04:46,229 --> 00:04:51,960
of the germans so the lists were useful

00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:54,150
so be careful what you do with the data

00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,360
and as i heard yesterday about ranting

00:04:54,150 --> 00:05:00,090
about data retention periods there's a

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,180
reason why we shouldn't hold on to data

00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:05,789
for too long and there's a reason why we

00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:08,580
have principles related to how we use

00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:13,199
data in the best possible ways to solve

00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:16,139
problems what we're facing today is are

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,599
many questions our societies are

00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:22,110
changing one way or another and i

00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:24,780
usually compare european law to the

00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:28,139
Sagrada família so I don't know if you

00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:30,629
guys have been to Barcelona but it's a

00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:32,990
cathedral by Gaudi that has been

00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:35,520
building up for many many years and

00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:38,130
European legislation is a bit like that

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,639
as well as it's based on common law

00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:43,710
legislation which is not the same thing

00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,840
sorry it's Basel civil law legislation

00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:48,389
which is not the same thing as common

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,779
law in the United States so from the

00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:53,909
beginning the way we build legislation

00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:56,430
in different continents is not the same

00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:59,150
as such the United States and

00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:03,900
anglo-saxon countries are outliers as

00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:07,169
they had give more power to the courts

00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:09,270
and jurisprudence which is not same

00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:12,120
thing as our construction of the

00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:14,940
European values which can be compared to

00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:17,219
the Sagrada família and today we will

00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:20,130
have to solve for many different

00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:22,620
problems in that sense the GD P R is

00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:25,800
basically a starting point this is a

00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:28,199
history of where the GD P R comes from

00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:30,719
in case you thought it kind of fell out

00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:34,820
of the sky it started after world war

00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:38,279
two so if there is maybe something or

00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:40,050
movie you want to see to understand the

00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:42,840
fundamentals

00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:46,439
ge PR legislation there's a Netflix

00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:50,639
series called the Tokyo trials which

00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:54,120
tries to understand how to judge war

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:55,949
criminals after World War one knowing

00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,339
also that they need to align with

00:06:55,949 --> 00:07:01,949
Nuremberg trials in that sense this

00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:04,650
Cathedral we're trying to build needs to

00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:08,189
be aligned with what we've done in the

00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:11,460
past and a lot of people always compare

00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:13,830
technology to legal but what I've seen

00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:15,930
is in the past and certainly for

00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:18,770
companies that have been there for a

00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:22,560
couple of years they have challenges

00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:24,740
related to the GDP are an obligation

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,389
certainly related to data subject rights

00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:30,509
because of the way they built their

00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:34,349
infrastructure so while technology is

00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:37,979
about legal so is the law and actually

00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:41,819
the law is a much more powerful legal

00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:44,460
box tool than technology is but where we

00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:47,279
need to make sure that it aligns with

00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,810
the history that we've built and this is

00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:52,110
what basically a lot of technology

00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:54,899
companies are facing today is I bet my

00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:57,870
infrastructure in this way hence I

00:07:54,899 --> 00:08:00,870
cannot be compliant with the GD P R and

00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:03,449
this is where a lot of legal experts

00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:05,039
also say it's not because your

00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:08,430
technology doesn't allow you to be

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:12,449
compliant that it makes it compliant so

00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:15,479
history plays a important role and in

00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:18,060
that sense this is where it all started

00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:20,310
this idea of human rights the

00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:23,580
Declaration of Human Rights that was

00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:26,219
published by Eleanor Roosevelt in 1948

00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:28,770
which is also why we created the United

00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:30,930
Nations and you can say well it's not

00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:33,779
very useful and who cares and there's

00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:37,019
boats of refugees in Italy that nobody

00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:39,149
wants but we are trying to build our

00:08:37,019 --> 00:08:41,849
societies according to certain values

00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:44,699
and in that sense we all have a role to

00:08:41,849 --> 00:08:48,420
play as employees of technology

00:08:44,699 --> 00:08:50,760
companies as data subjects as parents

00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:52,440
but everybody has to role to play inside

00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,709
here to make sure that we allow

00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:58,410
with that this is what the GTR is trying

00:08:55,709 --> 00:09:01,290
to do the G declares basically makes

00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:04,680
between the digital single markets we

00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:08,720
want to build hopefully 28 countries

00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:13,319
maybe 27 and three others so 30 or 31

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:15,449
but balanced with the evolution of this

00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:18,420
Declaration of Human Rights which is the

00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:21,689
Charter of Fundamental Rights of the

00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:25,009
European Union so as a technician

00:09:21,689 --> 00:09:29,579
I wouldn't recommend you read to GDP or

00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:31,949
99 articles 173 resettles it's a bit

00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:34,050
much to digest to be honest but the

00:09:31,949 --> 00:09:37,259
Charter read the Charter of Fundamental

00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:39,660
Rights keep that in mind when you're

00:09:37,259 --> 00:09:43,050
building when you're processing data

00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:45,589
collecting data these are the values

00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:49,560
that we want to protect moving forward

00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:53,370
it's not just Europe it is a global

00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:57,360
movement the United Nations recognized

00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:59,579
the right to digital privacy a couple of

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,620
years back and now we're talking about

00:09:59,579 --> 00:10:04,680
supervisory authorities on a global

00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:07,500
level so it's not just Europe it's

00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:11,759
really a global movement as we digitize

00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:14,329
our societies in that sense as I said

00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:17,519
it's like a cathedral we built on top of

00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:20,220
things through history in that sense

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:25,470
that GDP are basically addresses article

00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:27,689
8 of the the Charter an e privacy you

00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:33,870
might have heard about as well addresses

00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:36,380
article 7 the fundamental value that

00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:39,870
we're trying to protect is human dignity

00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:42,750
this idea that you should be allowed to

00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:45,509
choose your life and to be yourself

00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:48,120
which is also recognized by movements

00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:50,430
like the and Frank foundation where they

00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:54,300
go around the world explaining what

00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:57,269
happened during World War two so I have

00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:58,949
here a slide to back compares GDP are to

00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:00,870
say whether it's good or bad for

00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:03,559
technology I'll let you read it at some

00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:04,650
point but technology is obviously

00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:08,000
transformed

00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:10,290
our societies and in that sense

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,170
legislation like the GD P R is actually

00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:15,690
important there are things that were

00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:19,200
seeing involved when it comes to new

00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:22,530
incumbents within our societies that are

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,960
not ideal so I live in Madrid I have

00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:29,310
friends in Barcelona they don't like

00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:31,680
Airbnb Airbnb is changing the way that

00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:33,660
their neighborhoods are functioning and

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:37,050
I'm seeing it where my mother-in-law

00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:40,710
lives people with suitcases moving

00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:43,440
around a lot of noise and the fruit shop

00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:45,990
kind of disappears you can't live in

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,060
certain neighborhoods anymore so it's

00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:50,190
not just about solving problems for your

00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:53,850
company it's about how society is

00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:56,940
changing overall and the thing is also

00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:58,890
there's not the same way of thinking

00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:02,010
about it between Europe and the United

00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:05,100
States as I mentioned before this idea

00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:08,190
of the Charter of Fundamental Rights for

00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:10,890
us privacy data privacy is about rights

00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:14,400
the United States talks about the data

00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:18,030
market which is where for example the

00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:21,660
French don't like this idea that I am my

00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:24,540
data my data is part of me it reflects

00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:26,520
part of me but it's not something that

00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:29,430
can be sold or shared one way or another

00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:31,950
and we need to find ways to work better

00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:36,240
in order to make sure that our values

00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:39,150
are supported through time so this is

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,540
also what the GD P R says basically in

00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:44,310
rest'll 6 it talks about the fact that

00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:47,130
processing personal data should be

00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:50,040
designed to serve mankind it also

00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:53,550
continues by saying that it's not an

00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:55,590
absolute right and this is something you

00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:59,520
probably see a couple of times through

00:12:55,590 --> 00:13:01,260
your work where one may be legal counsel

00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,810
will say you have to delete the data and

00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:06,030
your compliance officer will say oh no

00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:08,490
no no we work in this kind of sector and

00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:10,920
we need to keep it so you have to

00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:14,580
balance these different obligations and

00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:16,950
rights it's not about not allowing

00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,190
people to use their data it's about

00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:21,300
making sure that we

00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:24,580
all accountable for what we actually do

00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:28,180
so the reason why we talk about the gdpr

00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:30,490
is obviously the fines if they're fines

00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:33,520
weren't there if that stick wasn't there

00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:35,410
we wouldn't follow the carrot so this is

00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:38,410
why we obviously talk about this this is

00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:40,720
a representation of all the articles and

00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:43,930
how they're interlink so as I said I

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,720
won't tell you that it's easy but it's

00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:49,120
certainly interesting to understand and

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:53,860
if you understand the Charter I think

00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:57,280
we're going in in a good direction what

00:13:53,860 --> 00:14:00,460
does the gdpr do basically what the GTR

00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:04,450
tries to do is to reintroduce those

00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:06,760
rights within the data ecosystem so it's

00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:09,610
obviously about companies being

00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,450
compliance laws being pushed by

00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:13,360
governments

00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:16,300
it's about industry organizations trying

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,370
to defy standards and this is only

00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:21,550
starting we're not there yet

00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:25,630
but it's certainly about data subjects

00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:27,670
citizens you me my mother-in-law your

00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:31,150
grandmother's and everybody that is

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:32,590
around you sharing data more and more

00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:36,190
because our societies are being

00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:38,320
digitalized and the gdpr didn't happen

00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:40,450
in the vacuum so obviously we talked

00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,310
about this because of the fines but

00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:45,640
we're also seeing that the systems are

00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:48,570
getting more and more complex if I try

00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:54,010
to define data flows of my mobile phone

00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:58,000
between my ISP my OS the apps that I

00:14:54,010 --> 00:15:00,460
have on this it's not easy at all so our

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,670
systems are becoming more complex we

00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:06,970
need to become more accountable for how

00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:09,520
we push data from different systems and

00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:11,620
how we actually use it and this is also

00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:14,260
a challenge for supervisory authorities

00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:16,630
because when you read the law they talk

00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:19,930
about controllers and processors and

00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:22,780
maybe joins controllers reality is a lot

00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:24,820
more complex so communication with

00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:27,339
supervisory authorities about what you

00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:29,650
do making sure you're on the right way

00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:31,030
is important today to assure this our

00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:33,790
accountability

00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:37,240
and because moving forward this is not

00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:39,250
just about your company this is about

00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:41,020
the societies we're going to build with

00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:44,800
Internet of Things machine to machine

00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:46,420
data transfers and in the end data is

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,860
going to be make decisions about our

00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:53,560
lives this is a picture of customer

00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:56,740
service that I saw at San Francisco

00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:58,440
Airport about 10 years ago it reflects

00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:00,250
what I think about customer service

00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,370
there's nobody there

00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:06,460
so every time you call a call center

00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:09,340
it's about now one for this and I'll

00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:12,310
true for that my issues are usually

00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:15,310
rather complicated I prefer to talk to a

00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:18,460
person so we have come to a point where

00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:20,860
technology can do a lot of things but

00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:23,620
now it's time to start balancing the

00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:27,430
uses of it and making sure it aligns

00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:29,950
with our values the other picture is an

00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:32,380
example of what's for example going on

00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:35,400
in the United States you might have

00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:39,490
heard about this algorithms that define

00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:42,310
how long the sentence of people will be

00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:44,890
you are in front of the courts within

00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:47,530
European legislation that would never

00:16:44,890 --> 00:16:49,740
exist because you have a right to

00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:52,420
understand what the input is of

00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:54,760
algorithms what the outputs are

00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:57,730
certainly if they influenced your lives

00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:00,550
and while we talk often about credit

00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:02,310
scoring for example knowing how much

00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:06,010
time you're going to spend in jail

00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:07,360
certainly does influence your life so

00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:10,600
it's interesting to see how these

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,730
debates certainly between the United

00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:16,630
States and Europe but also looking more

00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:19,990
towards Asian countries are going to

00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:22,540
evolve to try to maybe solve this or get

00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:24,839
better at making sure we build the

00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:27,459
societies that we actually want

00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:30,460
something that is also coming out more

00:17:27,459 --> 00:17:31,620
and more is that we build models and we

00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:35,640
build systems

00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:39,330
algorithms that kind of spit out a

00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:42,610
solution at point at one point in time

00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:44,410
data changes people's lives change

00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:45,010
there's a limit to how much you can

00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:48,370
model

00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:51,460
the lives of individuals and even the

00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:54,820
European Court of Justice understands

00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:57,010
that if you start defining models you

00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:59,760
have to revisit them from time to time

00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:02,560
and this is what we've seen for example

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:05,410
within the issues within the financial

00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:08,770
sector they created models for hedge

00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:11,980
funds and well the outcome wasn't great

00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:14,470
and what we're seeing also is people are

00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:17,230
getting more savvy about how their data

00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:19,330
is being used so this is a friend of

00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:21,370
mine Paul Olivia day you might have seen

00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:23,980
him next to this guy called Christopher

00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:27,310
Wylie with red hair in front of the

00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:30,370
Europe in the UK Parliament he started a

00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:32,320
movement a couple of years ago about how

00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:35,320
to ask your data from Cambridge

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:38,470
analytical he worked then together with

00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:41,770
the Guardian and from there well

00:18:38,470 --> 00:18:44,260
basically he built a website where you

00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:48,730
can ask for your date from Cambridge

00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:51,340
analytical and so that information those

00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:54,190
requests are called subject access

00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:56,860
requests or SARS and this is a bit -

00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:59,370
what I wanted to talk about today so

00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:01,870
let's talk about the law this is the

00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:05,320
representation the logo of the Dutch

00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:06,760
Supervisory Authority I think they have

00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:10,180
a good description of what's actually

00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:12,970
going on it's not about personal data or

00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:16,390
non personal data or analyzation data

00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:18,940
it's about bits of me little bits that

00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:21,970
come together and that in the end

00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:25,390
certainly if I'm an outlier can define

00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:26,380
me one way or another 15 years ago in

00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,810
the United States

00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:33,130
Latanya Sweeney showed that if you took

00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:36,100
zip code dates of birth and gender you

00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:39,280
could identify 80% of the population in

00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:42,250
the United States this is a reality we

00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:45,460
all know that we also know that with

00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:47,110
four points of geolocation we know who

00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:49,920
the person is and where that person

00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:53,320
lives that's been proved by a Belgian

00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:56,740
mathematician working for MIT so it

00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,690
exists we know the power of data the

00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,690
question is how are going to make

00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:04,210
that were at least compliant and

00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:08,230
hopefully built towards more ethical

00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:11,320
data uses so if I had to sum up the GDP

00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:12,760
are in one picture it's that I'm not

00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,250
going to talk about everything but if

00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,380
somebody asks you what is this thing

00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,940
called GDP are send them the picture

00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:22,030
nice and easy

00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:26,110
what I did want to talk about a bit are

00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:30,960
the obligations under the GDP are within

00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:37,840
the data ecosystem and in that sense

00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:39,880
that model kind of looks like this so in

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:42,810
the center are what's called data

00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:45,160
controllers the banks the pharmaceutical

00:20:42,810 --> 00:20:48,490
companies any company you do business

00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:51,280
with or your customer of data controls

00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:54,820
are responsible in front of data

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:58,600
subjects so the citizens they also use

00:20:54,820 --> 00:21:01,300
tools behind them to do their processing

00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:04,420
they're called data processors behind

00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:07,780
there might be sub processors like cloud

00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:11,260
service providers the big challenge

00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:15,040
today as the GDP are before reinforces

00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:17,500
these rights for data subjects is to

00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:20,800
assure that well they can actually

00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:22,660
comply with these rights so these are

00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,810
the rights that I want to talk about and

00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:27,850
what happens if people start complaining

00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:31,390
or asking for their rights and the

00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:33,760
companies don't reply well then these

00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:36,460
data subjects comply complain to the

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:39,840
Supervisory authorities in this case

00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:42,670
it's the ICO in the UK Germany has

00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,140
supervise your authorities per lender so

00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:45,520
that makes it interesting as well

00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:49,840
certainly if you listen to

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:51,940
schleswig-holstein Hamburg or Berlin but

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,550
then these supervisor authorities who

00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:57,160
have an obligation to take in those

00:21:54,550 --> 00:22:00,220
complaints talk to data protection

00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:02,590
officers within companies to make sure

00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:05,710
that they have abided by the principles

00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:08,920
and so a lot of companies are worried

00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:11,470
that basically one well trouble is

00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:13,000
coming which is true

00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:14,559
but it's not as if the supervisor your

00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,110
authorities are going to knock on the

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:19,960
door of companies and say hey here's a

00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:23,020
bill for 20 million euros they're going

00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,840
to ask questions just like I do when I

00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:28,150
talk to processors and they aren't going

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,610
to have a conversation and where the

00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:33,159
company the data controller will have to

00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:34,900
prove that they are accountable and this

00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:37,720
doesn't mean you have to solve for

00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:40,299
everything but at least show you have

00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,640
tried to do the right thing and it's

00:22:40,299 --> 00:22:45,610
through these conversations that we'll

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,950
be able to do better so keep your eyes

00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:50,860
open related to any questions that come

00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:53,650
from supervisory authorities and please

00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:56,289
try not to be too negative with legal

00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:58,450
counsel knocks on your door so the

00:22:56,289 --> 00:23:00,510
question that the the theme I want to

00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:05,020
talk about today are data subject rights

00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:07,950
so it's mainly article 15 to 22 there

00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:11,679
are as I said 99 article and the gdpr

00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:14,710
some of them are actually not new so the

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,720
right to access that was introduced

00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:18,610
within the GD P are back in the

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,700
directive actually is something that's

00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:23,620
not new you as a data subject can send

00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:26,500
an email to any company you're doing

00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:30,370
business with and say what kind of data

00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:33,520
do you have about me so think about that

00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:36,760
what are the consequences of such rights

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:41,020
on the way your data is being processed

00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:43,000
within your company article 16 talks

00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,799
about the right to rectification then

00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,049
you kind of go down the line and be more

00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,940
specific the right to erasure

00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:53,350
the right to be forgotten you might have

00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:56,049
heard about that's companies like a big

00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:57,159
company in the United States compared to

00:23:56,049 --> 00:24:00,010
book-burning

00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:03,010
under the Nazi period like we don't

00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:04,750
exactly look at it in the same way the

00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:07,179
right to be forgotten is about making

00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:10,390
sure that mistakes you've done in the

00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:13,720
past will not continue to haunt you for

00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:16,780
the next couple of years so what happens

00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:19,510
to article 16 and 17 well it's

00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:23,620
interesting because things are obviously

00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:24,800
moving and certainly since the GD P R

00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,980
came into force

00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:30,560
stances are changing two years ago when

00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:34,370
we talk to processors and we said hey if

00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:37,220
I get a request for deletion

00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:40,400
will you help out and this is where most

00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:41,150
processors would say no because it's not

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,180
PII

00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:47,000
and this is where controllers say well

00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:49,340
you know there are these fines so it

00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,590
would be nice if we could actually align

00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:53,840
and make sure that you can help us out

00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:57,020
because I don't want to pay the fines

00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:59,450
and so within the gdpr there's also an

00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:03,020
obligation to make sure that this is

00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:05,270
decided contractually speaking so the

00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:07,550
name of the game for the moment has been

00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:10,240
about signing data protection addendums

00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:13,760
between processors and controllers

00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:16,580
making sure the lawyers hedge for their

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:20,000
risk but the thing is those contracts

00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:22,640
need to translate into what we actually

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,290
do with the data so this is where it

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,110
gets interesting because you need to

00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:29,120
start looking at those contracts and

00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:32,060
define and make sure that you agree on

00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,730
what personal data is and this is often

00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:36,460
a point of contention as well personal

00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:39,800
data is not PII

00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:43,730
personal data is broader than PII PII is

00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:47,810
a subset of personal data it's been

00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:51,500
defined per US state so there are 50

00:25:47,810 --> 00:25:54,710
lists of PII in the United States hair

00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:57,650
color is one in California who would

00:25:54,710 --> 00:26:00,710
assault gender is considered personal

00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:03,520
data in Spain most contracts so these

00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:06,920
discussions about it is or it is not

00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,720
we're actually not very useful because

00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:11,210
basically what you're trying to do is

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,970
make sure that you can do business and

00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:17,960
you're all accountable so think about

00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:19,910
that when you use data merge data are

00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:23,000
you getting closer to uniquely

00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:24,620
identifying an individual or not I saw

00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,970
interested in presentations yesterday

00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:31,730
and one about IP addresses IP addresses

00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:35,240
our personal data so was through that

00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:36,500
presentation wondering about consent but

00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,230
apparently the

00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:43,120
the presentation wasn't about that in

00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:47,030
any case data subject rights are not

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:50,870
rights that apply by default so this is

00:26:47,030 --> 00:26:52,700
the position of MasterCard each company

00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:55,669
will have their own position but what

00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:58,549
certainly happens when people send

00:26:55,669 --> 00:27:00,710
through those data subject requests is

00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:01,850
that this is not going to happen

00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:05,690
automatically

00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:08,120
there are rules and definitions as to

00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:13,429
when data subjects actually actually

00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:16,730
apply so ideally your legal counsel or

00:27:13,429 --> 00:27:19,010
privacy officer or ideally data

00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:22,429
protection officer should think about

00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:24,559
how these information these requests are

00:27:22,429 --> 00:27:27,530
being received and how are they are

00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:29,270
actually being passed down the line they

00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:31,460
will not always apply but they'll have

00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:34,520
to have a communication with the data

00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:37,340
subjects to explain what's going on and

00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:40,340
how they can actually do that and so

00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:44,150
this is where I can share with you a lot

00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:46,070
of legislation legislative bits but I

00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:48,980
don't think it's very useful but it's

00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:50,570
interesting to understand that you can't

00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:53,390
really do this programmatically

00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:57,620
certainly not in the beginning so

00:27:53,390 --> 00:28:00,820
different reticles to take note of so I

00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:04,700
think it's important to understand that

00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:07,760
right to access is about the fact that I

00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:10,909
want to know what type of data you have

00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:14,450
about me so it's not I want a data dump

00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:17,390
like from Facebook it's about what are

00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:20,480
you using it's open question is a start

00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:22,820
of a conversation with your customers to

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:25,370
understand what kind of data there's

00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:27,799
there what's important to understand

00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:30,530
also is that a company has one month to

00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:33,679
reply so it doesn't mean that they need

00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:35,960
to solve everything within one month but

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:39,320
they have an obligation to start that

00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:42,110
conversation within one month so think

00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:44,720
about that and how these processes will

00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:46,909
be set up logically speaking you will

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,090
receive requests not from the outside

00:28:46,909 --> 00:28:51,550
but from with

00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:53,880
in your company to see how you can solve

00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:58,000
it and have a conversation about that

00:28:53,880 --> 00:29:00,760
so those subject access requests also

00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:04,270
required to develop some form of

00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:07,090
identification procedure if you're going

00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:08,860
to share information with somebody who's

00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:12,310
supposed to be a customer of yours or a

00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:16,060
client or a user you have to make sure

00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:19,920
that that person is actually who he or

00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:22,840
she says she is and this is where

00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,850
legislation is kind of a bit far from

00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:27,400
your reality

00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:30,610
typically the lawyers talk about asking

00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:33,310
for a photocopy of the identity card of

00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:36,220
the passport when we're talking about

00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:39,970
for example the gaming sector and apps

00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:42,850
on your mobile phones it wouldn't make

00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:46,600
sense to actually ask for a photocopy I

00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:48,520
can have direct links to data subject

00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:52,120
requests where they can push through

00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:54,910
their IDs related to the game that are

00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:57,280
actually playing so be worried about

00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:59,680
what lawyers say oh you need to

00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:01,960
photocopy of the passport I don't want

00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,990
to be sitting on data about people's

00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,880
passports because that is also personal

00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:09,270
data and God knows that needs to be

00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,220
secured so think about these

00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:14,710
identification procedures how would with

00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:17,980
that work within the line of business

00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:21,340
you are in if you're a bank it's not the

00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:23,920
same thing as if your role of Yahoo does

00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:28,060
Angry Birds so these are things to think

00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:30,760
about the right rectification is about

00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:32,890
this idea that well I don't want to have

00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:36,070
wrong data about me following me around

00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:38,500
a couple of months back I was listening

00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:41,260
to the University of Kilburn who was

00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:44,080
talking about group privacy and they

00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:47,560
said imagine your grandchildren are

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,510
going to have decisions about their

00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:51,790
lives

00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:55,840
imported onto them because of stuff you

00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:58,330
did 50 years ago that sounds ridiculous

00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:01,390
but this might happen if we're not

00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:02,830
careful and if we don't think about well

00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:05,140
you know how

00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:07,810
our data is actually being managed how

00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:10,840
long we keep it and if the quality of it

00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:13,540
is actually any good so from the right

00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:17,200
to rectification going down the list we

00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:20,010
have the right to ratio and again it's

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:24,040
not an absolute right there are moments

00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:27,400
when well these this data needs to be

00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:29,860
kept typical examples are I am an

00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:32,050
employee I have obligations to keep

00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:33,930
employee data for five to seven years

00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:36,910
depending on the country where I'm in

00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:40,630
but it's important to acknowledge these

00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:43,240
requests I get these requests I answer

00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:46,300
within a month and I explain why it's

00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:49,270
possible or it's not possible this is

00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:52,630
also where we see that systems are

00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:54,930
intricately linked with one another it's

00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:57,640
not always easy to delete all the data

00:31:54,930 --> 00:32:00,550
so a lot of systems what they're doing

00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:03,750
is deleting the keys so that I can't

00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:06,700
join it together anymore which is nice

00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:10,720
it's a short-term solution to the

00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:14,770
problem longer-term ideally that data

00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:17,200
should expire be deleted to make sure

00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:20,350
that you respect the data minimization

00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,570
principle so sometimes when you think

00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:25,500
about these requests it requires

00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:28,720
different steps today we'll do this in

00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:29,620
24 months our data retention period

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,320
kicks in

00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:34,410
the data will be deleted and so I can

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:37,840
make sure all the data is actually gone

00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:40,690
so again these are conversations to have

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,700
with data subject to certain points but

00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:46,270
certainly with supervisory authorities

00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:47,830
on making sure you actually do the right

00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:51,190
thing according to the accountability

00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:54,520
principle so what's interesting within

00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:58,480
our societies is that basically this

00:32:54,520 --> 00:33:01,900
compliance obligation is not seen in the

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,850
same way by different actors certainly

00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:05,740
if these actors are spread across

00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:09,370
different continents with different

00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:11,890
bases for the rule of law well basically

00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:15,310
you have to have conversations with your

00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:16,480
sub processors or your processors to

00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:19,450
make sure that if you

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:22,179
controller you play the right role and

00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:25,120
do not get the finds note that there is

00:33:22,179 --> 00:33:27,790
a possibility to also then go against to

00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:30,549
control the processors behind you to

00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:32,980
push on the finds on to them as well so

00:33:30,549 --> 00:33:36,010
again this idea of accountability we

00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:37,929
created a data ecosystem now we're

00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:42,370
trying to make sure that they abide by

00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:44,890
the values within our societies so

00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:49,179
something to note as well as this idea

00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:51,790
of erasure actually applies to all the

00:33:49,179 --> 00:33:53,410
copies you have as well and this is

00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:56,679
where you can start thinking about best

00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:59,020
practices if it applies to all copies

00:33:56,679 --> 00:34:01,390
I've made and within my company I have

00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:05,049
no problems with making copies of master

00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:08,800
data maybe that's not the greatest of

00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:11,409
ideas so basically the GD P R is trying

00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:15,369
to solve for data quality making sure

00:34:11,409 --> 00:34:18,340
the structure of your data is better set

00:34:15,369 --> 00:34:21,040
better defined master data management

00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:23,260
and data governance are clearly part of

00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:27,760
the entire equation around compliance

00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:31,090
and as I said before is it going to be

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:33,669
automated deletion well it depends again

00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:36,270
on the type of company you are if I am

00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:39,879
MasterCard or I'm visa or a bank

00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:42,190
probably I log in somewhere I can ask

00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:45,159
for deletion of my data through some

00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:48,030
form of a portal it's not the same thing

00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:51,580
if I'm a small start-up in San Francisco

00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:53,379
so when lawyers say and you take you

00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:55,899
have questions for the lawyers and they

00:34:53,379 --> 00:34:59,170
actually say it depends well because it

00:34:55,899 --> 00:35:02,410
does depend the way compliance works or

00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:04,840
alignment with the gdpr depends on your

00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:07,690
situation the type of data you have and

00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:10,450
your structure as well it's like when

00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:13,810
you ask things about technology should i

00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:16,869
implement Kafka or streams or HDFS or

00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:18,970
whatever it depends and this hasn't been

00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:21,460
solved in like six months

00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:24,070
we still see evolutions related to these

00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:26,230
technologies as well so why would you

00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:28,990
require from lawyers to actually have

00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:30,220
the magical bullets at the same time and

00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:32,859
within one

00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:34,920
conversation of half-an-hour think about

00:35:32,859 --> 00:35:41,369
it and think about this idea of

00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:41,369
accountability and responsibility so

00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:49,359
yeah so I think this is rather rather

00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:53,440
clear other articles mainly articles 18

00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:55,810
21 and 22 are slightly more complex so

00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:59,080
it's not just about access or deletion

00:35:55,810 --> 00:36:01,990
or rectification it's about the fact

00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:07,359
that well I don't want you to process my

00:36:01,990 --> 00:36:09,340
data I understand that as a data subject

00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:13,210
you need to process my data to send me

00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:16,869
an invoice but I'm not super happy with

00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:18,460
you profiling me and sending me specific

00:36:16,869 --> 00:36:21,369
information about products I've never

00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:22,930
asked for so this sits within the

00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:26,099
restriction of processing which is

00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:29,290
article 18 a right as well the

00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:31,599
consequences of that are interesting

00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:35,080
because it means that you'll have to

00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:37,780
flag certain customers who have not

00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:42,040
agreed to certain processing operations

00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:44,320
to exclude them from certain systems so

00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:46,540
it means that you start to think about

00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:49,960
what are those data processing

00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:52,330
operations when I collect the data when

00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:54,550
I process the data when I stream delay

00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:58,300
that when I view the data processing is

00:36:54,550 --> 00:37:01,000
very broad within the GDP are what do I

00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:03,970
do with our data and what do I promise

00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:07,210
that I will do with that data and how

00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:09,609
can they make their choice known related

00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:13,390
to what they want to be done with that

00:37:09,609 --> 00:37:16,930
data so restriction of processing will

00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:19,450
probably push you towards separating

00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:22,270
your processing operations and also your

00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:24,190
clients to make sure that you process

00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:28,150
according to what they have agreed with

00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:31,410
and what makes sense we used to be all

00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:35,470
about let's collect everything and see

00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:37,480
what's what comes out of it the GDP are

00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:40,330
kind of pushes this back because of the

00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:43,119
fines and because of well basically the

00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:43,810
rights of data subjects towards an idea

00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:47,440
of collect

00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:50,440
what you need it doesn't say you're not

00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:53,200
allowed to do anything anymore it says

00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:55,150
you have to be accountable you have to

00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:57,940
define what you're going to do with that

00:37:55,150 --> 00:38:00,730
and in that sense that definition sits

00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:03,670
within the notion of purpose there is a

00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:06,490
reason why I collect something the

00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:08,770
biggest challenge today is defining that

00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:11,560
purpose but also how that purpose

00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:14,410
actually stretches what are customer

00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:17,620
expectations and how far when we stretch

00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:19,060
that purpose how close do we get to

00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:22,840
actually being creepy

00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:25,210
so again expectations of customers and

00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:28,750
trying to define why you're collecting

00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:30,430
the data or maybe being well a bit more

00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:33,880
conservative about everything that

00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:35,430
you're collecting this is also where in

00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:38,260
one of the presentations yesterday

00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:41,350
somebody talked about agile companies

00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:43,540
but also collaborative companies I had

00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:46,230
never heard the term before but I think

00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:49,840
it's really where we need to go towards

00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:52,390
being agile allows you to move away from

00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:56,050
this idea of let's collect everything

00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:57,730
and in case we need it we'll see because

00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:59,950
you're more agile you could actually go

00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:02,670
back and collect what you need for a

00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:06,010
further purpose being collaborative

00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:09,100
means that through your different

00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:11,770
departments you understand how you use

00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:15,970
the data and it this is where I think we

00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:18,340
should all strive towards data

00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:22,510
portability is totally a new right

00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:24,280
within the gdpr it's fascinating I think

00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:27,100
data portability is really interesting

00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:31,810
the way companies here today is the

00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:36,190
obligation to push out data if citizens

00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:37,090
want it so it doesn't go any further

00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:39,820
than that

00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:42,100
what is interesting within that as well

00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:45,280
is this idea that well it doesn't

00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:48,670
include inferred data so it's all the

00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:52,600
data that's basically customers have

00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:55,330
shared with you or have shared through

00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:56,640
clicking on websites or different uses

00:39:55,330 --> 00:40:01,109
of their tools or things that

00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:04,589
that if you define that somebody has a

00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:08,460
high pension for suicide probably that's

00:40:04,589 --> 00:40:10,230
not part of data portability so data

00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:12,960
portability is about this idea of what

00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:16,260
do I have about customers that they gave

00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:21,869
me and how do I push it out the long

00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:25,799
term idea is data democratization if we

00:40:21,869 --> 00:40:28,950
get more and more companies helping

00:40:25,799 --> 00:40:32,940
customers gets there subject access

00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:38,059
requests we kind of creates a pile of

00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:41,760
data that data could actually serve in

00:40:38,059 --> 00:40:43,980
solving other kinds of problems and this

00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,529
is where I think Europe has an advantage

00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:48,690
I looked for example at the presentation

00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:50,940
yesterday from the transportation

00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:54,089
industry in Norway which was interesting

00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:57,660
but collaboration between public and

00:40:54,089 --> 00:41:00,510
private companies is basically what data

00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:05,099
portability is all about the thing is

00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:07,410
the gdpr doesn't define that market GDP

00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:10,740
are just says you have to push out the

00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:13,440
data and then we'll see what else is

00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:15,660
going to be created I think this is the

00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,640
biggest opportunity within the GDP our

00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:20,490
except for data quality and making sure

00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:26,609
we build moving forward for better

00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:29,099
societies overall a last one article 22

00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:31,890
which is also being discussed a lot

00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:34,710
certainly within digital is this

00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:37,109
discussion about you have to write not

00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:41,279
to be subject to automated

00:41:37,109 --> 00:41:45,390
decision-making including profiling so

00:41:41,279 --> 00:41:49,079
the interesting part of this is well if

00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:52,890
you gave explicit consent that doesn't

00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:54,329
apply so if somebody says I don't want

00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:55,740
to be profiled

00:41:54,329 --> 00:41:58,200
I don't want to have automated

00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:59,730
decision-making about me but that person

00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:03,059
gave their consent

00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:05,549
this is one of these rules that you need

00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:08,700
to have within your systems to say it's

00:42:05,549 --> 00:42:09,840
based on explicit consent so what you

00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,820
should do is

00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:14,310
to withdraw your consent which is

00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:16,740
something that is defined within the

00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:17,820
gdpr then we can have a conversation

00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:22,710
about this

00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:25,050
the reason this exists is because well

00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:27,570
these kinds of automated decision-making

00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:31,260
are actually making decisions about our

00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:35,070
lives so the typical examples for this

00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:38,520
are credit scoring if I ask for a credit

00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:41,850
at a bank and I get refused I can ask

00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:43,380
for an explanation I can ask to say okay

00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:46,170
what did you do and where does it

00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:48,390
actually come from so it can happen

00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:51,840
actually before you start a contract

00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:54,240
with a company so it basically allows

00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:57,740
for more transparency within the data

00:42:54,240 --> 00:43:00,960
world which is I think rather important

00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:02,760
it is also possible to use this and I

00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,190
won't read everything if we're talking

00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:07,980
about legitimate interests so one of the

00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:10,020
presentations yesterday talked about the

00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:14,070
different ways to make data processing

00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:16,400
lawful there are six ways to make data

00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:18,830
processing lawful within the GDP our

00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:22,440
consent is just one of them and

00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:25,260
obviously the other one is legitimate

00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:28,050
interest but the thing is the GDP are

00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:30,480
also says that a company can use that

00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:33,240
lawful basis of processing in their

00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:36,930
legitimate interest if it doesn't go

00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:40,650
against the fundamental rights of data

00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:42,480
subjects so while I understand that

00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:45,090
legitimate interest is an interesting

00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:48,840
way to assure that your processing is

00:43:45,090 --> 00:43:52,170
lawful it also kind of feels more like a

00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:54,930
philosophical essay about data subject

00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:57,990
harms then actually pushing data through

00:43:54,930 --> 00:44:00,440
consent mechanisms so if somebody tells

00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:04,110
you all we're using legitimate interest

00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:06,150
be worry about that make sure that they

00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:08,910
have done their homework related to that

00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:10,770
I know it's not your job but legitimate

00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:11,670
interest is not a wild card to do

00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:16,820
whatever you want

00:44:11,670 --> 00:44:21,619
when it comes to data processing

00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:25,519
profiling defined within article 22

00:44:21,619 --> 00:44:28,190
is broader than what it used to be I'm

00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:30,049
talking to certain American lawyers what

00:44:28,190 --> 00:44:32,230
they basically said it's profiling is

00:44:30,049 --> 00:44:36,920
very bad word in European legislation

00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:39,470
and it's true so if you are going to do

00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:43,009
profiling one way or another there are

00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:45,160
obligations sorry to undergo what's

00:44:43,009 --> 00:44:47,960
called data protection impact

00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:49,839
assessments it's basically a list of

00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:53,450
questions you have to go through and

00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:55,819
which will define measures to make sure

00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:59,749
that your compliance obligations are

00:44:55,819 --> 00:45:03,200
well balanced if you work within these

00:44:59,749 --> 00:45:06,140
kinds of projects it's great to have DP

00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:08,930
is because dpi is support accountability

00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:12,009
and support documentation as well and

00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:14,480
you can find them within the French

00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:16,490
Supervisory authorities the Spaniards

00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,160
everybody has their lists of data

00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:21,559
protection impact assessments these are

00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:25,220
great tools to make sure that you are

00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:28,099
compliant so look for them it's not fun

00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:29,839
but at least it allows you to understand

00:45:28,099 --> 00:45:32,029
what you can do and what you can't do

00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:33,769
and to actually prove you have done the

00:45:32,029 --> 00:45:38,920
right thing if somebody knocks on your

00:45:33,769 --> 00:45:42,579
door so automated decision makings

00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:45,529
basically as I said credit score's loans

00:45:42,579 --> 00:45:47,839
educational scoring or I talked about

00:45:45,529 --> 00:45:50,720
the fact that my grandchildren might be

00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:52,670
rated based on what I did I'm very

00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:56,539
scared about the data that is being

00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:58,369
collected by my children but let's see

00:45:56,539 --> 00:46:00,499
what happens in in the long term but if

00:45:58,369 --> 00:46:03,529
they get refused into any kind of

00:46:00,499 --> 00:46:06,049
education I as a European subject have

00:46:03,529 --> 00:46:09,259
the right to ask where that information

00:46:06,049 --> 00:46:10,519
comes from and again it's based on this

00:46:09,259 --> 00:46:13,460
idea of the Charter of Fundamental

00:46:10,519 --> 00:46:14,720
Rights even though the gdpr doesn't talk

00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:16,970
about discrimination

00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:20,269
it's about this it's about making sure

00:46:16,970 --> 00:46:22,700
we can live fulfilled lives in the long

00:46:20,269 --> 00:46:24,380
term and there are still issues that are

00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:26,960
really open out there price

00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:30,319
discrimination by Airlines is that

00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,839
lawful we'll see how the courts will

00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:36,020
figure that one out

00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:38,569
so if I had to wrap out the reality

00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:41,299
check at least in my digital world

00:46:38,569 --> 00:46:44,839
well usually technology looks like this

00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:48,020
and where I see also companies talking a

00:46:44,839 --> 00:46:50,869
lot about digital transformation or data

00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:53,690
leaks or Big Data projects but without a

00:46:50,869 --> 00:46:55,549
lot of structure around it so it would

00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:58,960
be interesting and this is what the GD P

00:46:55,549 --> 00:47:01,460
R is trying to push to start making sure

00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:04,700
you are accountable for your data

00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:07,280
processing operation and understand how

00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:09,760
that data is actually being used note

00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,930
that a lot of tools that I use today

00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:14,869
even though they have for example

00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:18,349
consent mechanisms don't even talk about

00:47:14,869 --> 00:47:21,319
purpose so this is what we need to start

00:47:18,349 --> 00:47:24,650
thinking about moving forward some

00:47:21,319 --> 00:47:27,470
numbers so the GD P R got enforced on

00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:31,910
the 25th of May of this year

00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:35,299
the Dutch received 170 complaints in the

00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:37,220
first week the Irish Supervisory

00:47:35,299 --> 00:47:39,799
Authority which is an interesting door

00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:44,799
for American companies on the European

00:47:39,799 --> 00:47:47,869
continent 1300 the Spaniards are

00:47:44,799 --> 00:47:48,559
estimating at 10,000 complaints this

00:47:47,869 --> 00:47:52,069
year

00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:54,980
note that the Spanish LPD is the closest

00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:56,660
to the GDP or so for them it's piece of

00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:58,849
cake they haven't finished their

00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:01,069
implementation of the GDP are yet the

00:47:58,849 --> 00:48:01,910
law is not there they'll probably add

00:48:01,069 --> 00:48:06,200
new stuff

00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:08,990
knowing the Spaniards on our side as DPO

00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:11,900
for a customer data platform called M

00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:15,619
particle we have received over 3,000

00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:20,390
requests now we can solve for about 12%

00:48:15,619 --> 00:48:25,880
of them and why is that well because

00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:28,819
identity is not easy to define so I just

00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:32,599
want to have a quick show of hands who

00:48:28,819 --> 00:48:37,309
knows what an idea phase what's an idea

00:48:32,599 --> 00:48:40,819
thing Apple IDs for advertising who

00:48:37,309 --> 00:48:45,579
knows what I died these are Google IDs

00:48:40,819 --> 00:48:45,579
yes do you know where to find them

00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:52,490
you know where to find the idea of a

00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:55,309
specific app and how do you feel a

00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:57,260
subject access request well basically

00:48:55,309 --> 00:48:58,640
you just send an email to the company

00:48:57,260 --> 00:49:01,579
and see what comes back it's a nice

00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:04,520
exercise and does anybody know how to

00:49:01,579 --> 00:49:06,380
complain to the supervisory authority or

00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:08,150
usually you go to their website and

00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:10,940
you'll find one way or another to

00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:13,550
complain to them so I'd like to finish

00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:15,710
with this the legislation is not perfect

00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:17,990
I hear complaining about it every day

00:49:15,710 --> 00:49:20,869
it's like how the legislation is so

00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:22,760
unclear it's not a technical requirement

00:49:20,869 --> 00:49:25,309
that's your job

00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:28,520
the job of lawyers is to work together

00:49:25,309 --> 00:49:31,250
and supervisory authorities to make sure

00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:33,859
that well we understand each other and

00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:37,300
we foster data exchanges and certainly

00:49:33,859 --> 00:49:41,420
defined purpose of the uses of our data

00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:44,000
I'm happy with the 12% resolution rate

00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:46,940
at M particle we're trying to find ways

00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,819
to make that better and what we should

00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:52,670
actually focus on is as I mentioned

00:49:49,819 --> 00:49:55,400
purpose classification what are you

00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:58,010
using the data for and this is where you

00:49:55,400 --> 00:50:00,380
have conversations with your legal

00:49:58,010 --> 00:50:02,630
counsel to say I'm using it for this is

00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:04,819
that description good enough how we

00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:07,460
might add that kind of work to make sure

00:50:04,819 --> 00:50:10,099
that it's a bit extendable these are

00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:12,260
known practices you can do that but you

00:50:10,099 --> 00:50:15,049
have to start working on this idea of

00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:19,549
purpose classification God knows Apple

00:50:15,049 --> 00:50:21,799
has started in 2016 your apps could not

00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:25,160
access personal data on your mobile

00:50:21,799 --> 00:50:28,430
phone unless a certain field was filled

00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:30,920
in the big question is what is Apple

00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:33,250
sitting on currently and the mystery

00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:36,160
hasn't been unfolded yet

00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:40,069
ideally purpose should look like

00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:42,530
accounting within a company money comes

00:50:40,069 --> 00:50:45,170
in money goes out they are accounting

00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:48,829
principles this is what we need to build

00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:53,180
for data as well and things like consent

00:50:48,829 --> 00:50:55,460
rails traceability or lineage are things

00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:57,420
that are starting to exist now we have

00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:59,540
to start to work together to make sure

00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:04,530
that accountability actually works

00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:07,589
across the data ecosystem so I started

00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:10,920
my career when that one came out the

00:51:07,589 --> 00:51:13,140
data deluge I was like ah so much data

00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:15,869
great I don't have to go to the

00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:18,720
statistical Society in Belgium and get

00:51:15,869 --> 00:51:22,049
diskettes about information I'm really

00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:24,390
happy about that but due to the history

00:51:22,049 --> 00:51:27,510
of my family and the fact that I'm an

00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:30,299
outlier I'm really worried about the

00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:32,040
future of our societies as well and this

00:51:30,299 --> 00:51:34,770
is where basically we need your help

00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:37,349
thinking about what is the GDP are

00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:39,420
trying to accomplish in order to make

00:51:37,349 --> 00:51:42,109
sure that we built better societies

00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:44,790
moving forward so I couldn't say enough

00:51:42,109 --> 00:51:46,559
read the Charter of Fundamental Rights

00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:48,839
if you don't want to read the GDP are

00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,369
it's fine but read the Charter of

00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:52,349
Fundamental Rights because basically

00:51:50,369 --> 00:51:55,640
that's all we're trying to solve for

00:51:52,349 --> 00:51:55,640
thank you very much

00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:05,760
thank you so much aurélie oh we got some

00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,830
time for one or two questions

00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:17,030
other questions remarks comments in the

00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:17,030
audience this is a question I'm not sure

00:52:22,410 --> 00:52:27,150
well I got one orally or coming from the

00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:30,180
technical side of things our building

00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:32,910
data systems I'm wondering how we can

00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:34,620
better navigate this gray zone of is my

00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:36,840
system compliant or not what does it

00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:39,090
does it allow for compliance II we have

00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:42,330
there's a wonderful ecosystem of the

00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:44,430
Apache big data stack mm-hm and we build

00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:47,280
solutions out of many different

00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:49,680
components dozens if not hundreds do we

00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:52,140
now start need to start putting stamps

00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:55,080
compliancy stems on components and say

00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:56,970
hey with this I'm sure I I persist

00:52:55,080 --> 00:53:03,690
buffer cache data but I can also remove

00:52:56,970 --> 00:53:06,900
it yeah it depends I think that when we

00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:10,560
talk about compliance as I showed in the

00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:14,310
beginning compliance to GDP our means a

00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:17,220
lot of things and the first discussions

00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:19,890
we had was basically about where the

00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:22,770
data was so if you want to talk about

00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:25,170
compliance of systems probably the first

00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:26,850
question to ask is where is your data

00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:31,020
what are we talking about

00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:34,140
so the GDP are doesn't want to not allow

00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:37,140
data to go beyond Europe but it would

00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:39,480
like for fundamental rights to be on the

00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:42,660
same level for the country where the

00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:44,730
data is also going so usually the first

00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:47,340
questions are about those systems and

00:53:44,730 --> 00:53:49,230
when they're distributed what kind of

00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:51,210
countries are you using and are you

00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:54,390
making sure that the rights of

00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:56,730
individuals are also abided by within

00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:59,280
these different countries the next

00:53:56,730 --> 00:54:02,010
question then is often are you

00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:05,220
collecting personal data which then

00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:09,900
opens up in Pandora's box because as we

00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:11,790
saw personal data is pretty broad but I

00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,800
think the general idea is to say well

00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:17,940
there are principles within the GDP are

00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:20,370
can I abide by them is my data fair do I

00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:23,070
have data retention periods I should go

00:54:20,370 --> 00:54:26,670
down the checklist and then making sure

00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:29,700
that I have a method for processing data

00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:33,120
in the lawful way so you can basically

00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:35,820
build checklist relate to that and then

00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:39,600
have conversations about when you

00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:41,970
you're not sure and try to define ways

00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:43,650
to mitigate your risk related to being

00:54:41,970 --> 00:54:46,200
compliant because it's about that it's

00:54:43,650 --> 00:54:48,720
about mitigating the potential risk that

00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:53,670
somebody complains or somebody knocks on

00:54:48,720 --> 00:55:01,380
your door to say that's not good thank

00:54:53,670 --> 00:55:03,210
you other questions in the meantime well

00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:07,200
if not all this concludes our keynote

00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:07,650
session oh thank you again thank you

00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:15,059
very much

00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:15,059
