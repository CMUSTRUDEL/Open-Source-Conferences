Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2018 #bbuzz
Description: 
	Blockchain has been a buzzword and there is a lot of hype around it, there is no doubt. But what are people doing to actually make it happen? We will explain what are the technical details that make blockchain technology unique. 

Let's get into enterprise grade blockchain applications and discuss various concepts in the space. A deep dive into Hyperledger frameworks and tools will be provided, followed by some interesting study of real world applications. We will finish with a demo of how blockchain can help improve the world we live in today.

	00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:12,040
so welcome everybody my name is Marta P

00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:14,889
carska as you could see I'm director of

00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:17,680
ecosystem for Hyper ledger in the Linux

00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:19,930
Foundation and I will explain a bit

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,230
later what does that mean and why do we

00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:25,570
have that weird system I've been about

00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:27,850
four years in the blockchain space they

00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:30,250
say that blockchain space you have to

00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:33,579
count the years in blockchain like

00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:36,640
dunkey years so it's times seven so I

00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:38,530
guess I've been what 28 years now which

00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:43,629
is only one year shorter than I've been

00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:46,510
living in general so that's it I will

00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:49,059
give you a brief overview of what Linux

00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:50,979
Foundation is and how does it tie to

00:00:49,059 --> 00:00:53,229
hyper ledger or how hyper load your ties

00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:56,260
to it and then we'll go into a bit more

00:00:53,229 --> 00:00:58,780
detail of what people do with blockchain

00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:03,909
how many of you have familiarity with

00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:06,360
blockchain okay so for fair amount

00:01:03,909 --> 00:01:09,310
they're great so let's start with that

00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:12,130
you probably asked people that are

00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:15,850
dealing more with big data and data

00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:18,070
analysis know Linux Foundation Linux

00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:22,289
Foundation is much more than just Linux

00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:25,479
we were actually set up 16 years ago to

00:01:22,289 --> 00:01:29,579
bring enterprises together and help them

00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:33,549
work and collaborate on various projects

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:36,429
that deliver open-source solutions we

00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:39,729
provide the governance the marketing PR

00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:42,100
support legal infrastructure we

00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:45,009
ourselves don't develop any code we are

00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:47,320
kind of that big house that hosts all of

00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:50,859
the projects what started with core

00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:54,009
Linux 16 years ago today grew to 50

00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:57,729
different projects and okay how many of

00:01:54,009 --> 00:02:01,380
you know kubernetes okay so this is a

00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:04,899
Linux Foundation project nodejs

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,579
similarly a Linux Foundation project but

00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:10,270
also we have projects you've never heard

00:02:06,579 --> 00:02:13,480
about probably like the automotive grade

00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:17,000
Linux actually most of BMWs used the

00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,880
automotive grade Linux and we also have

00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,300
drone project which I've kind of I know

00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:25,250
I'm very excited about it so two years

00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,840
ago people started coming to us and

00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,180
saying hey you know have you heard about

00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:32,450
this whole thing called Bitcoin and

00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:35,120
Jim's Emlyn our executive director Linux

00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:37,220
Foundation said yeah I do read

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,430
newspapers so of course I heard about

00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:42,370
Bitcoin but then the question was what

00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:47,450
does Linux Foundation want to do with

00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:52,520
with Bitcoin and we said Bitcoin does

00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:55,160
not fit the model that works well with

00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,200
Linux Foundation it doesn't have we

00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:59,300
couldn't be able to create a project

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,630
that will help bring the enterprises

00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:04,850
together to collaborate on an

00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:08,750
open-source framework however the

00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:11,780
underlying technology blockchain has a

00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,600
very huge very big potential so hyper

00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,980
ledger was set up as an open-source

00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,730
collaborative effort to advance the

00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:21,820
cross industry blockchain technologies

00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:26,470
and of course we are a linux project

00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:30,380
which basically kind of provides the

00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:32,230
infrastructure the the governance model

00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:35,090
for companies that want to develop

00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:39,290
blockchain based frameworks what is

00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:43,190
important is that we focus on enterprise

00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:46,790
great block chains so not the public

00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:48,530
permission less once but rather on the

00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:53,570
ones that can really help enterprises

00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:57,370
and today we started off two years ago

00:03:53,570 --> 00:04:00,890
as I said with 30 companies today we are

00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:03,590
250 different corporate members and an

00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:05,420
unknown number of open source developers

00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:08,269
that just contribute to the project and

00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:11,209
they you really have applications in

00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:13,880
every major industry so what is the

00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:16,040
vision of hyper ledger we really think

00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:18,650
that blockchain promises to change the

00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:21,769
way that businesses are conducted but

00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:24,530
there will not be one blockchain to rule

00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:26,240
them all if you hope that I'll tell you

00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,889
now that the theorem will die and only

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,620
hyper ledger fabric were winners

00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:34,830
thing like that no this is not the case

00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:37,409
bitcoin aetherium Z cache hyper ledger

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:41,729
framework scored a quorum all these

00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:42,479
these frameworks will coexist we hope so

00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:47,550
at least

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:50,550
to help enterprises and similar to Linux

00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:52,199
Foundation we decided coming from the

00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:57,360
premise that there won't be one

00:04:52,199 --> 00:05:02,159
blockchain to roll them all to use that

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,960
green house concept so in the next in

00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:06,360
Linux Foundation we have a green house

00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:10,080
of ideas for different projects in every

00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:12,300
major industry in hyper ledger we are

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,699
the community stewardship and the

00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:18,330
technological legal and marketing as I

00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:21,629
said kind of flight controllers if you

00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:23,490
will but anyone can come to us and say I

00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:26,069
have an idea can I plant it in your

00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,199
green house and if the community takes

00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:31,589
it up and wants to develop it as with

00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,360
any open-source project out there we

00:05:31,589 --> 00:05:36,419
will obviously be very happy to help

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,430
host it we started off with two projects

00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:42,330
it was hyper ledger fabric and hyper

00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:44,159
ledger soldiers today we have five

00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:50,669
different frameworks and five different

00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:53,659
tools we I guess briefly just can tell

00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:56,099
you that these frameworks are

00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:59,909
differentiated and the governance model

00:05:56,099 --> 00:06:03,479
and the consensus mechanisms that they

00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:06,839
use and they all can be applied very

00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:09,029
broadly so hyper ledger borrow is an

00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:13,889
implementation of the etherium virtual

00:06:09,029 --> 00:06:16,560
machine on ten German so it strips down

00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:19,469
the token side of things it strips down

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,919
the currency and looks at the etherium

00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:25,889
smart contracts and virtual machine and

00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:29,810
how this can be applied to enterprises

00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:32,339
and borrow is now actually being collabo

00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,139
collaborating and being module doubt so

00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:36,389
that it you can actually write so the

00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:39,419
smart contracts both and hyper ledger

00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:42,089
fabric and hyper ledger Psaltis hyper

00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:43,860
ledger fabric might be our most famous

00:06:42,089 --> 00:06:46,889
project

00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:49,020
that has been going on it's now in

00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:52,130
almost in version 1.2 it will be

00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:54,960
released very soon it supports both

00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:59,460
aetherium solidity smart contracts and

00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:02,460
the chain code which is a native native

00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:06,000
code that was written for fabric all

00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:08,400
fabric is written in go out of our

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,080
languages do now you can write your

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,200
business side of logic in other

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:17,570
languages like Java and JavaScript it

00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:22,430
uses a consensus mechanism called Kafka

00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:26,460
which is crash fault tolerant consensus

00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:30,390
hyper ledger indie is the community's

00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:32,880
response to identity issue I'm not sure

00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:35,250
if you're aware the fact that 1.3

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:39,500
billion people in the world do not have

00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:44,430
any kind of identity document that's

00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:46,020
mostly leads to things like human

00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,630
trafficking and not being able to

00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:51,750
identify people this also leads to

00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:53,880
problems whenever you're subject to

00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,860
crime you can't report it because

00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,710
countries don't recognize you and if you

00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:01,229
flee a country obviously all of your

00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:04,080
education all of your background is lost

00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:06,030
because we are basing it on documents

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,510
there are paper documents that you just

00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:12,810
want to destroy so Indy looks at how can

00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:15,720
we store private information and deliver

00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:17,310
identity solutions through the

00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,440
blockchain that will be immutable

00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:23,100
because that's one of the biggest things

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:26,370
about blockchain but also in a safe and

00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:27,990
secure way India is also used by the

00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:31,830
government of Philippines which I'll

00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:35,610
talk a bit more about and some projects

00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:36,419
with no your clients and banking then we

00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:40,289
have hyper ledger

00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:43,380
Aroha which is a project coming mostly

00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:45,720
from the Asian countries where they are

00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,130
focusing on mobile payments and very

00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,820
lightweight applications

00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:54,529
Aroha is written in C++ because we

00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:57,980
really need a tight memory control and

00:08:54,529 --> 00:09:00,829
is really very lightweight very

00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,980
applicable and then finally we have

00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:06,439
hyper ledger Sawtooth which is our

00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:09,769
second production ready code hyper

00:09:06,439 --> 00:09:13,550
ledger Salters this is a very

00:09:09,769 --> 00:09:17,600
interesting consensus mechanism called

00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:19,699
poet proof of elapsed time that executes

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,639
the consensus in the trusted execution

00:09:19,699 --> 00:09:25,999
environment and it's kind of a

00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:29,899
turnaround from Bitcoin consensus the

00:09:25,999 --> 00:09:32,449
proof of work where here you the person

00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:34,670
that or the entity that gets to put

00:09:32,449 --> 00:09:37,009
things on the blockchain is the one that

00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:41,059
wins lottery by being allocated the

00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:43,730
least amount of time execution time so

00:09:41,059 --> 00:09:46,579
instead of putting a lot of energy and a

00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:49,339
lot of effort into finding a solution to

00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:52,069
the riddle which effectively proof of

00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:54,259
work is where poet does the opposite it

00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:58,660
says who will spend the least amount of

00:09:54,259 --> 00:10:01,490
time on things and then we have tools

00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,689
cello composer and Explorer are three

00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:04,610
tools that allow you to deploy

00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:06,910
investigate and analyze what is

00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:10,129
happening on your block chain and then

00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:11,870
caliper is a benchmarking platform which

00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:14,269
everyone got really excited about it's

00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:16,129
our youngest project because it really

00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:18,889
allows you to stress test your networks

00:10:16,129 --> 00:10:22,899
and finally hyper ledger quilt coming

00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:27,259
from entity and ripple it is the

00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:31,790
intelligible implementation in Java so

00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:34,279
as I mentioned we kind of decided when

00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:36,410
we started hyper ledger that we strongly

00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:39,439
believe that blockchain is not crypto

00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:44,420
currency actually blockchain technology

00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:47,559
has been around for much longer than

00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:49,990
Bitcoin itself first mentioning zuv

00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:54,740
blockchain and time stamping with

00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:58,939
blockchain are from the 60s cypherpunks

00:10:54,740 --> 00:11:03,850
wrote their manifesto in ninety I

00:10:58,939 --> 00:11:08,140
believe to 93 proclaiming ideas that

00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:12,760
were built were built on top or hell

00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:14,590
to build VidCon debt cryptocurrency is

00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,780
an application that sits on top of

00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:21,490
blockchain but on top of blockchain we

00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:24,160
can put many more things so because this

00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:28,630
talk is not very long I figured that

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:31,780
I'll put this slide up and if you Google

00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:34,770
these 25 words I promise you and

00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:37,390
remember what they mean obviously I

00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:39,790
promise you that you can hold a fairly

00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:43,270
normal cone or informed conversation

00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:45,820
with people in the space it is about

00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:48,730
consensus mechanism it is about security

00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:50,260
and cryptography so there are some some

00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:52,930
concepts that there are obviously no

00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:56,800
very well known zero knowledge proof SAR

00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:58,810
in maths known for ages shaft 256 of

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,990
course as well then there of course

00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:05,290
ledger concepts like mining blocks forks

00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:08,400
that are very confusing because we don't

00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:10,450
have a common language or common

00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,880
translations of those things so people

00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:15,310
get confused and for of course we have

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:22,270
very specific platform concepts like

00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:25,230
nodes Oracle's or smart contracts were

00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:28,120
why enterprises really want blockchain

00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:33,580
because it provides that transparency

00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:36,280
immutability and really security by 2025

00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:39,580
the World Economic Forum predicts that

00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:45,280
10% of global GDP will be assets tracked

00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:47,940
on and distributed on the blockchain the

00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:53,340
blog business blockchain technologies

00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:56,320
provided very interesting platform for

00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:59,770
storing information for distributing

00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,990
information but also depending on how

00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:05,260
you deal with it you have different

00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:06,580
features that you can leverage so you

00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,080
probably have heard about the

00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,920
permissions and permission less

00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:14,380
blockchains and public and private the

00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:16,630
differences are very simple in terms of

00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:20,170
permission versus permission less it is

00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:22,110
who can write to a blockchain so imagine

00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:24,000
this conference right

00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:26,430
this is a permissioned blockchain

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,740
conference if you will because we all

00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:31,760
had to register and buy tickets we need

00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:35,670
a permission to enter this room right

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:37,680
but it if you look at pride public

00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:39,990
versus private it is about who can read

00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,829
from a blockchain information during

00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:45,600
this conference will be distributed over

00:13:42,829 --> 00:13:47,310
the internet anyone will be able to

00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,100
download without even prior registration

00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:52,470
we will not track who is looking at that

00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:55,950
information right so this is why it's a

00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:58,260
public conference now in terms of

00:13:55,950 --> 00:14:00,180
blockchain and coming back to that the

00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:02,220
question would be you know why do you

00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:05,279
need permission or permission less

00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:08,490
blockchain well I like to give the other

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:10,640
side of spectrum example medical records

00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:13,110
it is a very popular case that

00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:15,529
blockchain is nowadays used for sharing

00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:17,910
and storing the medical information

00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:20,550
because of the at the stations that you

00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:24,149
can make to it and the security of it

00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:28,410
however if I would tell you that anyone

00:14:24,149 --> 00:14:30,449
here can access my medical data and you

00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:33,839
know you didn't quite like my talk so

00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:36,570
you'll add a bit of hepatitis C to my

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,890
records well that doesn't really work

00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:41,760
right I want to keep that information

00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:44,310
private also only certain people should

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,800
be simply able to see if I have that

00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:50,279
hepatitis or not right it's my private

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,410
information and that's why medical

00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:55,110
records are being used on a permissioned

00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:58,620
private network network of hospitals

00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:01,140
doctors and patients but then there's

00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:03,350
middle ground so for instance land

00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:06,000
titles or university degrees where

00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:08,190
anyone should be able to check if I do

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,949
hold the PhD from Technical University

00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:13,260
of Berlin because I made a claim like

00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:15,570
that but only Technical University of

00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:17,699
Berlin obviously should be able to issue

00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:21,380
that certificate and said that I passed

00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:25,890
the exams right so that's the the ground

00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:29,399
now the block chain has blockchain

00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:31,829
technologies have been adopted by almost

00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:33,990
every industry today but if you look at

00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:37,920
the you know famous the

00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:40,320
of innovation curve it is different

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,690
stages so financial technologies are

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,270
definitely in the innovators space they

00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:47,220
jumped on it very early on and not

00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:48,690
necessarily for cryptocurrencies I would

00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:52,890
say that cryptocurrencies there is at

00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:56,550
least popular application and FinTech

00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:58,520
it's more for the reconciliation on a

00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:02,580
blockchain of transactions and real-time

00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:07,050
transactions then we have things like

00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:10,230
supply chain or healthcare which I would

00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:12,029
say are the early adopters to in 2018

00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:14,399
we're seeing more and more actual

00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:18,390
deployments rather than just proof of

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:20,730
concepts and then we have the logistics

00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:22,980
insurance and governments which are just

00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:25,620
catching up but they are catching up in

00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:29,700
an extreme speed there are two hundred

00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:31,649
and three different implementations of

00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,860
blockchain technologies in government

00:16:31,649 --> 00:16:38,089
space all over the world

00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:41,850
Netherlands smart Dubai or Dubai

00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:45,390
Singapore Estonia obviously are the

00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:48,149
leading countries there where in smart

00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:52,500
Dubai which is one of the members of

00:16:48,149 --> 00:16:54,420
hyper ledger we they have identified 23

00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:57,839
different citizen's stories or

00:16:54,420 --> 00:17:00,329
applications and by 2020 they are

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,180
planning to move everything that has to

00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:05,309
do with citizens on a blockchain so all

00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:08,670
information the way that you process

00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:10,230
information also things like payment

00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:14,400
gateways all of this goes through

00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:16,949
blockchain but to be honest I mean you

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,720
know I'm very hyped about blockchain in

00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:20,490
some ways but I'm the last person to

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,740
tell you the blockchain will solve your

00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:27,390
all of your problems I really like this

00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:30,110
xkcd because we as technologists as

00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:33,390
engineers tend to get over excited about

00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:36,809
engineering and about algorithm so we

00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:38,670
want to sprinkle that on everything well

00:17:36,809 --> 00:17:42,690
it doesn't work that way some problems

00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:47,850
are much bigger and harder and we need

00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:51,179
that cold showers sometimes to endure

00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:54,150
stand-up as I mentioned you know we

00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:55,710
launched two years ago we are a very

00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:58,740
growing community there are ways to

00:17:55,710 --> 00:18:01,289
become engaged with hyper ledger that do

00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:04,410
not work or actually everything in hyper

00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:06,330
ledger is completely open-source and it

00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:08,850
is not pay to play so you can can go

00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:12,120
download the code today start deploying

00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:14,220
with it playing around and so on we have

00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,130
active community working groups if

00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:19,860
you're not that technical you can come

00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:24,590
and join us on calls about health care

00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:24,590
about performance and scalability about

00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:29,789
governance I'm currently working with a

00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:32,039
team and please let me know if you're

00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:34,789
interested in social impact of

00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:37,919
blockchain because we are trying to find

00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:40,980
places there and of course identity is

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,870
one of the bigger ones just in the

00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:46,289
matter of time I'll skip these slides

00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:48,419
and go but already here because that's

00:18:46,289 --> 00:18:51,570
more interesting what are people doing

00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:54,809
with blockchain why why are they so

00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:59,460
interested and excited about it first of

00:18:54,809 --> 00:19:02,370
all we see a spectrum of Industry use

00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:06,049
Casas because there is a need for a

00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:10,470
decentralization trust and continuity

00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:12,929
that confirms over time now one

00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:14,630
important thing is that to recognize

00:19:12,929 --> 00:19:18,230
that there is a difference between

00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:21,000
decentralization and distribution

00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:24,240
systems like the distributed ledger

00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,000
technologies can be or should be

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,950
distributed so it should be spread out

00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,010
across different servers across

00:19:28,950 --> 00:19:34,710
different platforms but there is quite

00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:37,620
often a certain need for centralization

00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:39,929
on a blockchain for governance purposes

00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:43,159
you have to sometimes you have nodes

00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:45,360
that are stronger than the others

00:19:43,159 --> 00:19:47,750
and I know this is something that is

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,970
extremely controversial because in

00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:52,980
Bitcoin space you have truly

00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:55,620
decentralized distributed system but for

00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:57,390
enterprises you very often need a

00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:59,970
certain level of governance because

00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:01,470
things go wrong I mean we've seen it

00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:04,169
already that

00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:07,379
wallets get hacked that people lose

00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:09,840
money and Dow and how do you revert back

00:20:07,379 --> 00:20:12,360
that's only can be done through some

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,629
kind of a governance and agreement

00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,629
process

00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:19,289
one of the first implementations that

00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:22,700
we've seen was interstate Medical

00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:26,730
Licensing where the challenge was to

00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:32,269
share information about licenses and

00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:35,750
claims they are who claims processes

00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:39,090
that is that needs increase transparency

00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:40,740
and Trust because these are multiple

00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:42,629
doctrine only makes sense if you have

00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:45,779
multiple distrustful parties that need

00:20:42,629 --> 00:20:49,740
to exchange information and that trust

00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:54,470
it normally in world today it's kind of

00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:57,899
implied if I want to borrow money from

00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:59,279
you there you have to trust me right

00:20:57,899 --> 00:21:01,500
that I'll give you the money we can make

00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:04,740
right contracts and so on but at the end

00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:07,259
of the day we have to trust each other

00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:09,629
to a certain degree which is not normal

00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:11,909
people do not want to trust each other

00:21:09,629 --> 00:21:14,549
just by the sheer fact that we've met

00:21:11,909 --> 00:21:18,149
even worse in terms of companies people

00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:21,379
quite often don't meet so that trust is

00:21:18,149 --> 00:21:24,450
what blockchain really helps with

00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:26,570
another interesting example is in food

00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:29,669
industry food industry is really

00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:32,250
leveraging blockchain very widely and

00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:36,929
very is very excited about it because

00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:40,649
food trust is one of the weakest points

00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:44,039
in general this is an example of a

00:21:40,649 --> 00:21:46,799
seafood movement there is a company in

00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:51,870
China that recently joined hyper ledger

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:54,299
called JD and JD is tracking bananas on

00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:57,360
a blockchain so you can actually scan

00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:58,649
your banana bar a barcode and check

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:04,350
where it comes from what's the

00:21:58,649 --> 00:22:06,629
provenance because in China the honesty

00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:08,460
in food or food like the provenance of

00:22:06,629 --> 00:22:10,440
food is very rare you can actually like

00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:12,860
buy eggs and it turns out the American

00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,820
aid of plastic and things like that it's

00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:17,429
incredible what is half

00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:19,440
their rice and pork are also tracked

00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:22,080
through blockchain today to make sure

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:25,259
that pork that has been delivered to

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:28,830
your house is healthy it's it's clean it

00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:30,690
has the certification needed in this

00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:32,909
case what I really like about it and now

00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:35,700
pause here for a moment is the

00:22:32,909 --> 00:22:38,070
recognition that blockchain can just

00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:40,230
help solve part of the problem but will

00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:42,539
not solve it all and it can really

00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:45,269
improve what the living today but it

00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:47,580
won't just solve all of your problems

00:22:45,269 --> 00:22:53,309
and here's how it works

00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:56,370
so fishermen logs into his boat through

00:22:53,309 --> 00:22:58,919
a system and again this system has to be

00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:00,419
secure it has to be designed completely

00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,789
separately from a blockchain but you

00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:04,110
have some kind of another thing

00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:07,409
authentication method where a fisherman

00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:10,470
logs into his boat and goes off to fish

00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:14,820
right now we install we are able to

00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:17,460
install IOT devices that were track

00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:20,879
where the boat is and how heavy their

00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:23,009
nets are that picked the fish so that we

00:23:20,879 --> 00:23:25,259
know how much fish was caught and where

00:23:23,009 --> 00:23:29,009
was it caught so it was sustainable or

00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:31,649
not of course again the IOT devices and

00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:34,529
the whole server side of things has to

00:23:31,649 --> 00:23:36,330
be built securely and that doesn't

00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:40,200
matter if it's of doctrine or not lock

00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:43,110
chains technology we put that

00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,879
information on a blockchain to know that

00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:46,860
this batch of fish was caught in a

00:23:44,879 --> 00:23:51,029
sustainable way in a certain place as

00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:54,690
the fisherman comes to to the to the

00:23:51,029 --> 00:23:56,429
port again keep the fish's unloaded to a

00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:58,980
truck-a container

00:23:56,429 --> 00:24:01,200
dead container has monitoring system

00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:03,840
that allows you to verify what are the

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:09,649
conditions and time and path that fish

00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:13,440
went from the port to your LD or Qaddafi

00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:15,179
now when the fish arrives to the

00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:19,019
restaurant to the supermarket wherever

00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:22,019
and if it is spoiled in some way we are

00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:25,169
able to verify if it was too warm in the

00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:27,389
truck if it took too long time or maybe

00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:28,559
the fish was poisoned altogether from

00:24:27,389 --> 00:24:32,429
the very beginning because there

00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:34,499
some poisoning and the see if such thing

00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:38,639
happens we are able to execute smart

00:24:34,499 --> 00:24:41,039
contract in a way that does not that

00:24:38,639 --> 00:24:43,499
removes all of the dispute and insurance

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:46,860
that can be paid directly to the people

00:24:43,499 --> 00:24:49,740
that should get their money all of this

00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:52,230
means that the audit ability drops

00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:53,999
there's still need for auditors but it

00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:57,330
is not you know all the things the

00:24:53,999 --> 00:24:59,490
auditor the auditor the cost of the

00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:01,019
whole thing is lower because we have

00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:03,539
lower food waste the restaurants can

00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:07,169
plan how many portions of sustainable

00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:11,039
fish will they be able to to give to

00:25:07,169 --> 00:25:14,549
people and so the cost of a sustainably

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:16,919
caught salmon or tuna dropped down which

00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:18,840
means that all of us are inclined to buy

00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:20,129
a sustainable tuna versus non

00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,950
sustainable tuna because they are

00:25:20,129 --> 00:25:24,720
basically the same price which means

00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:26,490
that we are improving the ecology

00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,019
because now everyone's gonna go for the

00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:30,779
sustainable one rather than non

00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:33,179
sustainable one so that's a really

00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:36,419
interesting thing how technology can

00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:39,029
really go back and help us and we can

00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:41,669
help kind of build technologies that

00:25:39,029 --> 00:25:44,789
save the world and call me cheesy but I

00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:48,720
do like improving the world of it but

00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:50,639
also it shows how much of other factors

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,869
you have to think about when building a

00:25:50,639 --> 00:25:57,059
solution diamond supply chain is another

00:25:54,869 --> 00:26:01,309
interesting example because this is a

00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:05,009
place where technology brought this

00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:09,389
system with there was purely paper-based

00:26:05,009 --> 00:26:12,210
so traders of diamonds in coming from

00:26:09,389 --> 00:26:17,240
Africa all the way to Amsterdam where

00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:20,610
the biggest hub is decided to go with

00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:24,289
the solution proverb proposed or

00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:27,899
suggested by ever ledger where this

00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:30,570
amazing incredible woman that a CEO of

00:26:27,899 --> 00:26:32,700
ever ledger just came to them and said

00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:34,860
look and now I've so offer you a

00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:38,220
solution where you can track of diamonds

00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:40,049
who are from honest areas and what is

00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:42,300
the quality of diamonds that you're

00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:44,850
getting and that the one that you bought

00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:46,830
Africa is the same diamond that comes to

00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:49,560
you but you have to adopt this

00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:51,810
technology and now I think something

00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:56,520
like 80% of diamond trade is happening

00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:58,350
on a blockchain digital identity is

00:26:56,520 --> 00:27:02,970
something that I discussed already and

00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:06,600
talked a bit I promise to tell you 44%

00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:09,600
of Filipinos are only using bank

00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:11,760
accounts today that's because we don't

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,640
know how to do know your clients in

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:18,590
countries like Philippines so they've

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:21,810
partnered with hyper ledger in D and

00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:25,650
Amihan to build a solution that allows

00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:30,650
you to verify the honesty of your

00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:35,070
clients and and if their record of

00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:38,580
banking green assets management is

00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:43,830
another example of how can you track the

00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:49,350
co2 emission in China and how can you

00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:52,140
really collaborate and finally let's see

00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:56,970
I want to make sure that I get to the

00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:59,690
interesting yeah so real estate is will

00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:02,940
be the last example that I talked about

00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:04,950
again if anyone ever tried buying a

00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:07,940
house you know how horrible it is and

00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:10,910
how many offices do you have to go to

00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:13,140
bed with blockchain gets solved because

00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:15,570
offices it is a common misconception

00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:18,090
that governments and institutions

00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:19,710
without within governments trust each

00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:22,140
other right because it's one government

00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:23,880
well no they don't they don't you're not

00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:27,960
able to track the records they are not

00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:30,000
able to verify what is happening so this

00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,670
is a system that allows you to really

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:38,370
track that and speed up the process of

00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:43,440
buying or selling a house now all of

00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:45,390
that shows one thing which is we really

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,060
need collaboration a blockchain and this

00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:50,940
is one of the things that is hampering

00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:54,030
today's process of exploration the

00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:55,549
blockchain space because we are not able

00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:57,840
to convince

00:28:55,549 --> 00:29:00,390
enterprises or enterprises are not

00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:03,299
convinced that they can collaborate in a

00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:05,309
safe way so this is the next big step in

00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:08,340
the next problem how do we collaborate

00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:11,730
because doing proof-of-concept in your

00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:14,610
back office and proving that blockchain

00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:16,650
tech works yeah it does but if you want

00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:19,500
to really use it and deploy it and scale

00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:21,419
it up you need partners from various

00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:24,150
enterprises from various open source

00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:26,460
industries and then you have to kind of

00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:31,409
trust the technology not trust people

00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:34,380
but trust the technology to kind of help

00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:36,690
you if because I saw that some people or

00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:39,780
there was a big group here that is not

00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:41,640
very familiar with blockchain we have

00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:43,950
launched a course there is a free

00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,350
open-source online course on EDX

00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:49,860
platform like Coursera or like many

00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:52,260
others where which takes you from what

00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:55,409
blockchain is and what are the different

00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:58,470
aspects of blockchain all the way to the

00:29:55,409 --> 00:30:02,070
last stages are coding exercises on how

00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:04,070
to deploy your blockchain based on hyper

00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:07,140
let your fabric and base of hyper ledger

00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:08,190
Psaltis so it's a really you know open

00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:11,400
to everyone

00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:14,460
course that I suggest you take if you're

00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:21,150
interested in the blockchain space and

00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:23,610
then one last thing in Basel and yeah in

00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:24,900
December it will be very cold I can

00:30:23,610 --> 00:30:28,950
promise you that but it won't be that

00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:31,919
much colder than in Berlin we are we

00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:34,770
have we are hosting an open event an

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:38,669
open conference for everyone and we hope

00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:40,980
that by 20 December 2018 we will see a

00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:43,909
lot of use cases and deployments and

00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:46,289
this conference is really focused on

00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:48,480
deployment so we are putting a strong

00:30:46,289 --> 00:30:50,570
effort on both business and

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:54,030
technological tracks to talk about what

00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:56,039
what people are doing so with that I'll

00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:57,750
finish we still have like two more

00:30:56,039 --> 00:31:00,330
minutes so I'll take some questions and

00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:02,850
if not I'm around I'm wearing a spotty

00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:06,000
dress so it's easy to find me in the

00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:09,000
break and I can't see you so I don't

00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:12,929
know if there are any questions

00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:27,059
I don't think they are awesome oh yeah

00:31:12,929 --> 00:31:29,419
here yeah so there are projects like

00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:35,159
kubernetes yeah like open network

00:31:29,419 --> 00:31:37,679
solution open network on app and of

00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:39,419
course yeah we Linux Foundation House

00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,730
and doesn't pick and choose which

00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:44,179
project is better than the other we

00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:46,890
treat all of our children equally

00:31:44,179 --> 00:31:49,190
so if you want to get engaged with

00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:53,220
projects on databases and centralized

00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:55,620
databases that's absolutely fine in fact

00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:57,539
in many cases when people come to hyper

00:31:55,620 --> 00:32:00,030
ledger and say we want to develop with

00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:02,460
hyper ledger frameworks we said do you

00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:04,679
really need a blockchain maybe maybe

00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:11,400
there is another solution because there

00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:12,960
are downsides to blockchain okay since I

00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:21,510
don't see any more questions

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:25,250
oh there is one okay go on or not okay

00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:25,250
oh there I see one in the back

00:32:33,139 --> 00:32:37,169
yes so the way that it works on a

00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:40,610
blockchain the question was how do you

00:32:37,169 --> 00:32:43,200
deal with disappearing resources

00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:45,480
blockchain does not allow for deletion

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,190
in any way once you put something on a

00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:52,470
blockchain it stays for an R on a

00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:56,039
blockchain forever so that's the upside

00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:57,600
of it it provides immutability but it is

00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,279
also the downside of this because you

00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,200
have to predict what will be the

00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:05,549
consequences of putting information on a

00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:07,139
blockchain in ten 20 50 years time this

00:33:05,549 --> 00:33:09,480
is one of the big questions about

00:33:07,139 --> 00:33:13,470
identity because if we put private

00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:16,470
information on a blockchain it will last

00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:18,450
forever which means that we can you know

00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:20,940
play around with encryption you can do

00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:24,600
all that magic but encryption gets

00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:27,539
broken all the time and so maybe and now

00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:30,899
it's safe but in ten years time people

00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:33,299
will be able to see like break the

00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:35,580
encryption and see your very private

00:33:33,299 --> 00:33:37,679
information now maybe in ten years time

00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:40,710
it won't be as valuable but maybe there

00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:43,350
are things about you that you don't want

00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:45,929
to reveal ever to anyone that doesn't

00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:47,789
like that you don't give them access to

00:33:45,929 --> 00:33:51,779
it right you don't want that information

00:33:47,789 --> 00:33:53,840
to become public does that answer your

00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,840
question

00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:06,670
no there is no there are ways to

00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:08,590
deprecate the the blockchain right not

00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:10,840
to prevent it from blowing up

00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:14,050
information but blockchain is not a

00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:17,460
database it is an immutable record of

00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:21,190
events rather than immutable database

00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:23,800
which is a also a common thing you don't

00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:25,300
you should not be putting as much

00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,430
information on a blockchain because

00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:29,200
that's not what it is for it is it

00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:33,820
should serve as an attestation process

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:36,130
rather than a storage process if you put

00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:39,010
wrong information on a blockchain so you

00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:42,280
know make a claim that is not true what

00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:44,170
you can do is you can amend changes and

00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:47,350
say well this information that I put

00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:50,470
there is incorrect I'm introducing a

00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:54,570
delta a change but you don't remove that

00:34:50,470 --> 00:34:54,570
information embrace it with a new one

00:34:55,770 --> 00:35:02,320
okay thank you everyone it was a

00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:10,219
pleasure to not see you I guess

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:10,219
