Description: 
	Uwe Schindler talking about "Apache Lucene and Java 9+ — Opportunities and Challenges for Apache Solr and Elasticsearch"

Java 9, that came out on 21 September 2017, brings a lot of new features and speed improvements, but also many challenging problems for deploying Java applications. Apache Lucene/Solr 7, released two days before Java 9, was thoroughly tested with preview builds of the new Java release and was one of the first applications that were ready to be used with Java 9 from the beginning! Why was the adoption of the new Java 9 release so important for Lucene/Solr and Elasticsearch?

In this talk, Uwe will present some of the speed improvements that Java 9 (and later) brings to Apache Lucene users, so one should upgrade as soon as possible. He will also present what changed behind the scenes to make Apache Lucene compatible to the Java 9 module system (Jigsaw) and how the testing was done. Finally he will present the plans of using Multi-Release JAR files in current Lucene release, so users can still stay with Java 8, but get significantly improved performance when used with later newer Java versions: Java 10 is already there when Berlin Buzzwords start!
