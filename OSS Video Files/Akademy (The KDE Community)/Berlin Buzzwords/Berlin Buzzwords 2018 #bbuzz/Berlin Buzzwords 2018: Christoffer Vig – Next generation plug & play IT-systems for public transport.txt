Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2018: Christoffer Vig – Next generation plug & play IT-systems for public transport
Publication date: 2018-06-18

Description: 
	Christoffer Vig talking about "Transport-as-a-Service (TaaS) - How we build next generation plug-and-play IT-systems for public transport (ITxPT) at Ruter"

The digitalization of everyday life, where the average bus passenger would rather ignore the surroundings and stare blankly into his phone for snapchat updates, creates great opportunities for digitalization of public transport, as well as some challenges. Ruter, Norway’s largest public transport authority, is putting significant effort into improving digital services for customers.  However, the current technology stack behind Ruter's operations, is not able to provide the necessary real-time information.

In this talk I will explain how Ruter is participating in the development of new European standards for information technology for public transport (ITxPT), and how Apache Kafka and Kafka streams serve as the core components in building "Transport-as-a-Service".

	00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:10,880
I'm here today to talk about how are you

00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:13,550
today Norway's largest Transport

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,670
Authority is creating a new digital

00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:19,880
platform for improving their customer

00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:26,119
services and also to get better control

00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:27,800
of their data so the agenda today is I

00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:32,360
will explain a little bit about what

00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:36,920
Ritter is and what they do how they were

00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:40,430
engaged in the ITX PT project which

00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:43,460
tries to create a new european standards

00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:51,170
for information technology in public

00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:53,449
transport so this relates to toss or

00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:59,719
transport as a service which is the team

00:00:53,449 --> 00:01:03,350
I'm working in at Ritter so aperture

00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:07,700
kafka is the main technology and the

00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:11,680
core system we're using and now try to

00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:16,360
expand what about Kafka that makes it

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,360
obvious that it's the best choice for us

00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:27,530
so you twist the largest public

00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:29,480
transport authority in Norway they serve

00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:35,000
about three hundred and seventeen

00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:36,740
million passengers last year and they're

00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
based in Oslo and serves the surrounding

00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:42,170
so it's about one and a half million

00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,450
people in there it retails owned by the

00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:48,620
county of Oslo and our courses so it's a

00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:50,860
public company they get get money from

00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,860
the public

00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:59,450
are any of you and the users of public

00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:01,700
transport or under Dean not using public

00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:07,270
transport I guess this is something that

00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:07,270
most of us tend to use almost every day

00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:14,840
so what what do you think about it our

00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:20,300
offense you like your public transport

00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:23,300
services yeah so you like it good well

00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:28,610
sometimes it tends to not to be good as

00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:31,370
well you have to find out where to enter

00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:35,209
the bus or the vehicle you have to stay

00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:39,040
in hotel noisy places and it's kind of

00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:43,459
somebody else who defines the schedule

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:45,200
you can if you're a bit strict you can

00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:52,910
say that public transport is the

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:57,280
opposite of the freedom freedom of

00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:59,780
movement is one of the key human rights

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,049
Liberty to travel and Ameri about you

00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:06,440
please without impending the liberty of

00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:08,360
others of course and the ultimate

00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,959
embodiment of this used to be to own a

00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:15,410
car when you own a car can drive

00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:17,510
wherever you want when whenever I'm

00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:28,070
public transport is just the opposite of

00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:30,769
this however nowadays owning a car

00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:34,190
driving to work or to school or wherever

00:03:30,769 --> 00:03:35,390
you want to go more and more looks like

00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:37,989
this picture you're in the traffic jam

00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:43,209
you don't know where to park and it's a

00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:43,209
large costs it's a big hassle

00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,959
so car ownership ownership again turns

00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:56,630
into something resembling the opposite

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:59,870
of freedom routed along with several

00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:01,670
other public transport companies are

00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:04,910
working towards a vision of something

00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:07,700
they called mobility as a service which

00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:11,569
again will turn public transport into

00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:16,130
something that is inducing inducing

00:04:11,569 --> 00:04:18,169
freedom so mobility as a service is an

00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:20,450
extended version where you not only have

00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:24,820
the regular buses and trams and trains

00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:29,150
but you add add in rental cars and

00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:30,940
bicycles taxis all kinds of transport

00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,979
and they're all combined in the same

00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:37,310
digital platform and they're accessible

00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:39,440
in your smartphone and that makes it

00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:42,650
very easy to just tap into a solution

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,340
tap into an app select where you want to

00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:48,229
go of course you have to might have to

00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:53,030
walk a little bit that's very good for

00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:56,240
you but the idea is that you have a very

00:04:53,030 --> 00:05:00,320
immediate solution to create a route

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:03,950
from A to B now sorry transport as a

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:08,150
service which I'm talking about I will

00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:12,140
soon get to these pictures it's a subset

00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:14,270
of mobility as a service so transport as

00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:17,180
a service is something that will be a

00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:21,500
neighbor for a mobility as a service

00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:27,470
platform where we have ability to gather

00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:29,930
all kinds of transport means and no to

00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:32,180
illustrate why this is necessary I want

00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:36,320
to tell you a little story from my life

00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:39,700
and here comes the dog so this is my dog

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:46,970
his name is Miro it's a Japanese Spitz

00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:50,560
it's a puppy of five months and he needs

00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:54,380
to be taken out in the middle of the day

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,670
and this somebody is quite often me it

00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:58,440
takes him out

00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:01,140
so luckily I work and live in the center

00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,750
of Oslo so it's possible to take public

00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:06,930
transport to get home I'm back again and

00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:09,500
when I do that I try to do it in just

00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:13,710
one hour so I can just use one ticket

00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:16,560
because I live so close that I would

00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:18,360
rather walk but I don't want to be away

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:23,340
too much at the middle of the day from

00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:32,520
work sorry so this is where a map of the

00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:36,030
center of Oslo the typewriter is where I

00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:38,940
sit and type code and the picture of the

00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:41,370
dog is where me and my dog lives and the

00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:44,070
green and white lines those are two

00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:48,120
different tram lines so now I want to go

00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:50,220
home I can take any of these and I want

00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,760
to figure out which one is the fastest

00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:56,130
and can take me home the first so this

00:06:53,760 --> 00:07:03,720
is a screenshot from Mandira

00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:06,270
app which shows the planned timetables

00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:09,810
from my work and not unto home

00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:13,770
you see there are three different charms

00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:16,800
I can take trend number 11 18 or 19 and

00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:20,640
the departure times it's at 12 13 12 10

00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,040
12 14 unfortunately this is not

00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,680
real-time data so what is just ER this

00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:29,540
is kind of in the middle of the day this

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,010
is not correct the trams will be delayed

00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:34,919
luckily there's another screen and this

00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:36,140
app we can look up the estimated

00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:40,169
departure times

00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:42,930
this shows on the list of all liens

00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:49,650
trafficking a stop and the one I would

00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:51,840
take is number 11 - in my ocean and it's

00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:57,320
just that it is it will be at a stop in

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,320
one minute so we can

00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:02,830
first asset it's five minutes till

00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,150
number eleven is there and this one says

00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:10,150
one so you can see this big difference

00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:14,110
and once I go to the actual stop the

00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:16,000
tram is all together at the stop place

00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:19,450
there are also signs that show

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:23,560
information and these signs are even

00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:26,650
more accurate than the app but still

00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:29,410
they are inaccurate in my example it was

00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:31,750
just one minute off but very often it's

00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:35,919
a lot more so it's a lot of misleading

00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:37,660
information the current situation is

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:42,039
that the trip planning apps that don't

00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:43,840
use real-time data have some real time

00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:48,970
that are supposed to be real-time in the

00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:51,340
departure times the physical signs have

00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:54,930
even better real time data with Seagram

00:08:51,340 --> 00:09:01,810
and it makes the dog works too short

00:08:54,930 --> 00:09:03,270
it's a big problem so what does what is

00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:06,100
the reason for this what has happened

00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:10,660
the reason is that we just not own the

00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:14,140
data they don't own the buses editor ISA

00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:17,500
and authority to hire others to to run

00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:20,110
the services and they cannot directly

00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:22,750
access data from vehicles the real-time

00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:25,390
data we have available is coming from a

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:28,270
third party which is m2 which is the

00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:32,290
national body that collects all public

00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:34,450
transport information so the problem is

00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:38,350
that the operators control all the

00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:39,790
vehicles on the data at the same time so

00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:42,550
now we'll have to explain to you the

00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:46,840
difference between a PTI and a PTO in

00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:48,160
the public transport language a PTH at

00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:51,100
cetera theater is the one who's

00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,050
responsible towards the public and watch

00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:56,290
the government for public transport in

00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:59,140
an area they create all the timetables

00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:02,140
they do marketing like credit apps and

00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:05,350
websites and they order services from

00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:06,620
the PTO the PTO are the ones that

00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:11,320
actually own own

00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:11,320
the vehicles and they hire the drivers

00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:21,500
this is a map showing this is from the

00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:24,040
ITEX PT website I don't want to go into

00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:31,279
detail on this which it just shows that

00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:33,440
you have the various colored areas those

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:38,570
are representative of a geographic area

00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:40,550
and a PTI often has one area while a PTO

00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:43,460
the operators with the vehicles they can

00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:45,260
have several at the can work for several

00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:49,640
treaties so it's a management

00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:52,100
relationship here and as I said normally

00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:58,190
the operators sit on the data there's

00:10:52,100 --> 00:11:00,710
not much exchange so we didn't actually

00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:04,960
wanted to fix the situation with missing

00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:07,880
data so in 2016 I started the project

00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:11,330
with collecting automatic passenger

00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:15,050
counts or APC data these are sensors

00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:17,690
that sit right beside the doors inside

00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:20,060
of the buses and they can count how many

00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:22,550
are entering a bus on how many are

00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:24,380
exiting some of them can see the

00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:27,589
difference between child and adult

00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:32,180
someone can see if there's a wheelchair

00:11:27,589 --> 00:11:34,089
or a bicycle they're installing 400

00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:36,380
buses now

00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:39,410
so what happen is that there were three

00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:43,940
different actually several different

00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:46,580
vendors that created these systems and

00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:48,740
we have a situation where all vendors

00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,959
chose their own way of implementing in

00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:54,890
this then they're our own data formats

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:56,450
and their own way of doing it so like no

00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:59,270
be enough for instance they want to have

00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:01,940
data sent to their back-end and from

00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:06,140
their interpreter

00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:08,390
and some of them wanted to push data

00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:13,160
using a rest service some of them are

00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:15,140
pushing data to MQTT the data format is

00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:18,620
of course very different from every one

00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:20,390
of them and on some they're counting

00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:22,460
from starting from the beginning and

00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:27,650
just adding up till you till you're at

00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:29,870
the end so did ya there's just different

00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:32,750
meanings of the four data since nothing

00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:34,220
has been predefined they can just figure

00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,700
out or do whatever to go

00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:42,620
so as you understand their need for

00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:45,200
Standardization yes sir and this answer

00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:49,130
is the ITX PT projects information

00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:52,370
technology for public transport this is

00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:54,830
a European initiative I tried to create

00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:58,040
a so-called plug-and-play system for

00:12:54,830 --> 00:13:03,950
information technology for public

00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:06,820
transport they're actually having a big

00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:09,950
meeting today in Paris we're discussing

00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:13,790
how they should proceed these are some

00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:15,650
of the members of IT for PT well if you

00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:18,640
can see any Germans in there but there's

00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:22,270
a mixture of public transport operators

00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:25,550
authorities and people creating the

00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:27,230
technical solutions all we have an

00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:30,380
interest in how the standard should be

00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:32,390
are taking part and there are very

00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:35,780
active discussions there are 13 working

00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:41,060
groups who all have their say in various

00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:46,070
parts of the standard IT for PT has

00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:49,490
created four standard documents of which

00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:51,770
the installation requirements is talking

00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:54,110
about how they did the electrical

00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:56,540
current should be inside of the bus it's

00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:59,330
it's nothing that we care about the

00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:03,020
on-board architecture is about what kind

00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:05,030
of components a bus should have it

00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:08,270
should be present recording GPS and so

00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:09,830
on I will go into it later the back

00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:11,470
office architecture is what happens on

00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:13,570
the back of in the

00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:15,910
of a side that means how we handle

00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:19,570
traffic from the bus and how we handled

00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:24,010
the timetable plans the ovary

00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:27,370
architecture is about how to bridge data

00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:35,530
from buses to back-office so it's about

00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:37,810
a data transport okay and it's also a

00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:41,790
little bit snug but so this is a picture

00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:45,550
of the situation before I takes pity a

00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:47,350
bus has several components in this

00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:50,770
picture each of them has their own

00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:53,430
network connection and they all

00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:55,800
communicate with each other using

00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:58,240
probably wires from one box to another

00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:01,180
or if there's an network I don't know

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:07,360
and the driver screen is for different

00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:09,220
displays from four different boxes so it

00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,180
I takes pity you get a much cleaner

00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:18,150
picture there's one network connection

00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:18,150
all the components talk together in one

00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:27,240
in one network some of the components is

00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:30,850
Auto this is the display information

00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:33,240
it's the advanced vehicle monitoring

00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:35,920
system the system will not keep track of

00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:37,320
how the bus is progressing on its

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,790
journey

00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:42,220
there's the APC which I mentioned the

00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:44,500
automatic passenger counts the GPS that

00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:49,740
is the one that keeps track of the

00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,740
location the Midd is the driver terminal

00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:57,190
so the DP I module is the one that's

00:15:54,700 --> 00:16:01,270
responsible for creating information to

00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:05,230
the passengers so you can see on the

00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:07,360
left-hand side there's a box a front

00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:09,130
side display this one has to be very

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,970
visible so we are very limited in what

00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:15,310
you really can do and on the right hand

00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:17,400
side we see some other displays that we

00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:21,839
have been created in the Ritter project

00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,839
we will see this clear later on

00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:31,120
so the AVMs advanced vehicle monitoring

00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:34,139
system is to enact keeps track of the

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:41,769
progress and it informs to displace with

00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:44,620
information back-office several

00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:47,260
standards netflix is for plan data this

00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:49,029
is the thing that editor is doing you

00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:51,519
know figuring out where should the

00:16:49,029 --> 00:16:54,389
routes go how many buses to be needed

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,779
here and there and it's an ethics data

00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:57,880
series data

00:16:55,779 --> 00:17:00,880
that's the real-time data which is

00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:04,480
continuously updated as when the bus is

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:09,760
driving I say bus but it's also tram and

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:11,980
whatever and the over-the-air

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,049
specification talks about how

00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:19,120
communication between vehicle and back

00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:24,059
office should handle the specification

00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:27,280
talks about using an mqtt bridge which

00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:29,380
practically makes it possible to have

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:34,720
all information from the bus may route

00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:37,210
into the back office and also you can

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:41,500
Meerut sent information from higher

00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:45,010
office into the bus so transporters are

00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:50,740
serviced is the research way of doing IT

00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:54,250
xpt the concrete background between us

00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:57,820
creating this project was that the

00:17:54,250 --> 00:18:01,960
reader has to deliver has to get four

00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:03,880
hundred new buses available in 2019 they

00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:07,690
created a attender with specifications

00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:09,669
based upon eight x bt we had specified

00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:14,830
how they wanted the traffic to be

00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:18,900
between the buses and back office this

00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:18,900
was created by some people in my team

00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:26,590
based upon IT Expedia where of course we

00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:29,530
had senator has a policy to prefer

00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:31,660
open-source components wherever possible

00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:34,690
and the reason is that they don't want

00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:37,450
to be tied up to one vendor one

00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:39,310
assumption that return makes on the item

00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:43,000
check at expertise under is that all

00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:48,270
vehicles are always online this has the

00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:50,920
implication that we can always

00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:55,030
communicate with the bus and update

00:18:50,920 --> 00:19:00,490
information inside the bus in the ITEX

00:18:55,030 --> 00:19:03,610
pta standard there are several there

00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:05,290
it's a it's a standard in development so

00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:10,900
there are several different ways to do

00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:13,090
it normally or in the old style of doing

00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:16,480
public transport you have the a VMS

00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:19,690
system loaded with data when the bus

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,970
starts and it keeps track of progress at

00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:26,590
it as it goes reads it this progress

00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:29,530
from the odometer which just counts

00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:31,420
Amanda metres the buses driven and the

00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:39,090
figures out however it is at a route

00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:42,100
from this so what you do in route is to

00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:46,560
since we are always online we don't have

00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:48,310
to have an IV mess inside of the bus we

00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,140
pick out there

00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:53,440
FMS and do all the processing in the

00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:56,470
back office which of course has some

00:19:53,440 --> 00:20:00,100
advantages this means we can do machine

00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:05,410
learning we can figure out how long does

00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:11,620
the delay used to be on this point at

00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:14,970
this point of the road at this time and

00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:17,290
we were very flexible with how we create

00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:22,660
the information and also have it create

00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:24,880
at this place so this of course makes

00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:29,470
for a continuous stream of updated data

00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:31,180
back in to the vehicles and it also

00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:33,540
makes it easier to have the unexpected

00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,540
changes

00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:42,960
so this is a schema of the main data

00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:46,950
interactions in transporters of service

00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:49,750
so she's starting from the bus you have

00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:54,520
some interactions with streaming

00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:56,770
platform we're passing on the location

00:20:54,520 --> 00:21:00,430
the passenger counts and the sign on

00:20:56,770 --> 00:21:03,100
messages and there's so many information

00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:07,210
that is created handled onto the

00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:09,820
operator the operators of course have

00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:11,770
their own interests in in data from the

00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:14,710
bus this is not something that I'm

00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:16,510
talking about but an operator would

00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:19,600
probably have a whole different story

00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:22,330
about how this data is running the

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,830
operator is responsible for a driver so

00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:26,470
he has to texture make sure that the

00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:29,230
driver has the correct information while

00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:31,420
a true trivia are we care about the

00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:37,990
passengers so we must provide

00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:40,350
information to the passengers so what

00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:45,310
happens when a driver science into a bus

00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:48,730
he passes on to the streaming platform

00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:51,250
Vox journey he is on we combine the data

00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:54,430
from our planning system the TPS at the

00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:57,310
bottom of the picture so we can figure

00:21:54,430 --> 00:22:00,600
out what route is on I can come can

00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:00,600
monitor the journey

00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:13,970
so the interaction between the operators

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:19,190
and the authorities are happening

00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:24,230
because we know how the list of service

00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:27,580
journeys are are created to have the

00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:30,560
complete route for a bus for one day and

00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:32,870
this makes it possible to know in

00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:37,450
advance if a bus is delayed on one line

00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:37,450
it will be delayed also on the next

00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:49,110
[Applause]

00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,890
so the streaming come from at the middle

00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:54,810
of the picture is apart you cough cough

00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:57,480
so cough cough you may have heard about

00:22:54,810 --> 00:23:03,690
have some properties that make it very

00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:05,070
suitable for real-time processing so

00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:07,620
this is something I copied from the

00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:10,950
website through a problem or many times

00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:14,400
before but we use cough got to put these

00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:18,210
producers pushing and data to cough come

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,980
and we have stream processors modifying

00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:27,120
the data inside and we have several

00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:31,950
consumers and we will use a lot of

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:39,840
stream processing to enrich data coming

00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:42,000
in I will more about this later so the

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,510
traffic Tran system is where we keep

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:52,560
track of its our master database for all

00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:55,440
the journeys so this is something that

00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:57,270
we actually if all vehicles were on time

00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,690
we wouldn't need anything other than

00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:01,530
this

00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:03,480
this contains plan timetables and it is

00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:06,810
the same as thing I showed you at the

00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:10,340
beginning which says that the Sharma is

00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:10,340
departing at 12:10 and so on

00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:17,040
unfortunately delays happen all the time

00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:22,080
and certain facts of life TPS is

00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:24,630
available in a graph QL interface which

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,670
is very nice to explore the data this is

00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:31,170
an ethics model and it's extremely

00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:36,360
complicated it has a little justice key

00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:38,550
among some of the structures so what we

00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:41,760
do is to make it easy for ourselves we

00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:44,580
publish data from GPS into Kafka using a

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:48,450
batch job every night that publishes all

00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:53,130
da all the journeys that we are supposed

00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:55,800
to run on the current day so we set

00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:58,680
these topics with a clean up policy

00:24:55,800 --> 00:25:09,360
compact so we can just keep the latest

00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:11,310
item it's easy to manage us a table so

00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:16,620
let's have a look at some how the data

00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:18,090
flows inside of this system this is this

00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:20,280
is our demo bus we actually have a

00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:24,780
physical bus that we have installed all

00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:29,160
the components it's made for our users

00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:31,080
so it has just the things we need so

00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:35,010
let's pretend to be on board the palace

00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:39,120
bus and the first thing I have to do is

00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:43,650
to sign onto a vehicle we publish a sign

00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:45,540
on message to the MQTT topic pulsing on

00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:49,170
the number of the vehicle and the

00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:52,740
journey ID for the vehicle and this is

00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:55,950
my colleague perova doing a sign on to

00:25:52,740 --> 00:26:01,710
see his is holding an iPad or something

00:25:55,950 --> 00:26:04,380
and which is so perhaps not exactly what

00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:07,320
the driver will use but this is our demo

00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:13,020
and they've all made all things as a web

00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:16,230
service and it's very easy configurable

00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:21,830
with screens getting their information

00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:24,810
from Android things using raspberry PI's

00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:29,580
which makes the whole system is very

00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:33,090
easily reconfigure figural and this this

00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:34,530
way of during the digital dynamic

00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:37,440
passenger information is something that

00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:41,730
we are bringing into ITEX pity to try to

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:44,850
make them work towards a system that is

00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:47,630
very dynamic and not locked up to to the

00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,630
old ways of doing things

00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:57,680
the the sign on message must be matched

00:26:54,890 --> 00:27:00,020
towards the service journey from TPS so

00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:04,059
this is a little dump from that system

00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:06,500
where I just don't highlighted the ID

00:27:04,059 --> 00:27:09,550
combining sign on with service journey

00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:12,800
happens in a Kafka stream application

00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:18,620
using a global kettle for the service

00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:20,809
journeys since the key first sign on

00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:25,520
would be a vehicle and the key for

00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:30,559
global the service journeys don't have

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:32,179
any information on vehicles so what's

00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:36,230
interesting now is when we get the GPS

00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:39,710
signal just contains lots of information

00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:44,809
also the speed and so on joining this

00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:46,540
together we can figure out the location

00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:48,830
of the bus on a journey on the next stop

00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:54,320
in combining this with the departure

00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:57,130
times we can make estimates these are

00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:00,640
some of the images inside of the bus

00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:00,640
someone in this place

00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:12,200
so for a company like Rooter who cares

00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:14,080
about the passenger

00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,940
but fair on the passenger satisfaction

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:20,509
it's very important to have a full

00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:22,429
control of the displays this is

00:28:20,509 --> 00:28:30,259
something that we have created in in our

00:28:22,429 --> 00:28:34,549
system so as you can see the ITX PT

00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:37,129
standard combined with kafka enables

00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:40,460
real-time data processing for public

00:28:37,129 --> 00:28:47,389
transport and makes it possible to get a

00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:52,820
better estimate of the times something

00:28:47,389 --> 00:28:56,659
is supposed to be there and more

00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:59,899
importantly using cough-cough we are

00:28:56,659 --> 00:29:02,990
ready to handle any kind of producers so

00:28:59,899 --> 00:29:06,950
since we now have only our own system to

00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:10,100
get data from it works for the register

00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:15,769
but it can easily extend this to several

00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:18,320
other producers it can be small

00:29:15,769 --> 00:29:23,929
companies just publishing their service

00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:26,059
journeys into Kafka and we could get the

00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:30,350
GPS signal from all the sources as well

00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:32,509
and just do the same for other so we are

00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:35,570
ready to handle the mobility as a

00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:39,619
service the platform is ready only thing

00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:46,190
that's lacking is everything else so we

00:29:39,619 --> 00:29:48,200
have decoupled data from the producer so

00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:55,850
the conclusion is that mobility as a

00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:57,740
service improves animal welfare thanks

00:29:55,850 --> 00:30:03,840
for listening

00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:07,440
[Applause]

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,440
any questions

00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:19,820
I am the data that you are using to like

00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:22,190
sending between the central systems and

00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:24,320
the buses and is this data also

00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:26,270
available for third parties could you

00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:31,250
add like an application into it and like

00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:35,720
do something with it yes most of the

00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:38,450
data is accessible to public parties and

00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:42,350
this is the AMT which I briefly

00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:45,830
mentioned the globe national a company

00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:48,500
which keeps all the information for

00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:49,940
public transport companies I guess you

00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:54,230
have something similar in Germany as

00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:56,960
well so they have all information except

00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:58,940
for the blocks blocks is the list of

00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,130
service journeys and the list of

00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:05,150
journeys and that is very tightly

00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:06,440
coupled with the vehicles and this is

00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:09,950
not something that the public is

00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:12,650
interested in but it should be like if

00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:17,210
you want to create very good estimate

00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:20,180
secured use this information as well but

00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:21,920
it is very hard to know you wouldn't get

00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:27,130
information on what to vehicle runs

00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:29,960
what's a journey for us well at least

00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:36,020
and this data is something that may be

00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:40,040
available in the future - yes about the

00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:42,560
the equipment's and the buses what's who

00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:46,300
codes like what's the code running on

00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:50,090
that like what languages and who

00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:53,300
programs them as well well their program

00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:59,990
by different vendors so this is kind of

00:31:53,300 --> 00:32:00,770
not something I have control over so it

00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:04,070
could be anything

00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:06,740
cool I also have another question in

00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:08,450
terms of changes in the schedule for

00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:10,780
example there's a construction work and

00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:14,360
a big a beam or something how does the

00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:15,879
communication back to the operators of

00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:19,299
like you know

00:32:15,879 --> 00:32:20,769
a detours or other spot or the stops at

00:32:19,299 --> 00:32:22,569
the bus have to make and how does the

00:32:20,769 --> 00:32:24,940
communication work backwards is that all

00:32:22,569 --> 00:32:28,049
automated as well or is something manual

00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:32,259
that you know people have to adapt to

00:32:28,049 --> 00:32:35,619
the information about deters is also

00:32:32,259 --> 00:32:38,499
something that will be automated but of

00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:44,859
course we also have possibility to send

00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:46,839
manual messages to drivers so this is

00:32:44,859 --> 00:32:51,159
something that is who is responsible for

00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:52,749
this is the operator or the authority it

00:32:51,159 --> 00:32:55,229
depends but sometimes you just have to

00:32:52,749 --> 00:32:59,979
divide it it works today is that

00:32:55,229 --> 00:33:01,569
sometimes they just draw on a map on a

00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:04,569
good night or something and brighten

00:33:01,569 --> 00:33:06,959
your route and send it to the drivers by

00:33:04,569 --> 00:33:11,049
email but of course this will be

00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:12,909
automated sometime but it is probably

00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:15,929
not the first thing yes

00:33:12,909 --> 00:33:15,929
any questions more

00:33:22,299 --> 00:33:28,130
when you're dealing with always online

00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:31,150
do you then care about the event time

00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:36,260
you're sending or to your process on a

00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:41,659
ingestion time very good question thank

00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:43,880
you the in the contract with the

00:33:41,659 --> 00:33:45,830
operators we need the month that data

00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:48,169
should be no more than I think two

00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:50,270
seconds delayed or something so it has

00:33:48,169 --> 00:33:55,909
to be if this is something that's

00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:58,520
defined in the contract so that we have

00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:59,809
to what to do is really in practice this

00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:03,169
of course doesn't happen

00:33:59,809 --> 00:34:08,389
events are delight sometimes with

00:34:03,169 --> 00:34:11,389
several minutes so we in the back back

00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:15,800
office to be much much back with the

00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:17,929
correct location very much very much the

00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:21,070
passenger counts back to the correct GPS

00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:24,090
location yes

00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:26,590
[Music]

00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:29,620
lise with our local transport systems

00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:31,780
you learn fast which lines and transport

00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:34,480
options are unreliable you know as an

00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:36,640
individual you know that bus sucked so

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,800
you will know that from your data as

00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,240
well won't you will you be sharing that

00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,040
so he said I want a connection from here

00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:46,300
to there they'll don't go that one

00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:50,440
because you'll probably miss it do you

00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:52,390
plan to be honest basically well that's

00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:54,970
interesting I don't think we would share

00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:59,620
this ad so please avoid this bus or this

00:34:54,970 --> 00:35:00,010
driver but more this bus at this time of

00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:05,350
day

00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:07,600
yeah the answer is that we will of

00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:12,010
course use this information to improve

00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:13,810
the services and I don't think there

00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:16,600
will be a plain site where you can go

00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:19,960
and see what where to when on the way to

00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,590
avoid certain stop services no okay

00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:23,220
thanks

00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:23,220
that's a good idea

00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:30,850
okay if there's no more questions and

00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,810
thank y'all for coming and thank you

00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:36,860
