	00:00:05,729 --> 00:00:10,950
hello everyone my name is Gopi Krishna

00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,950
moti

00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:16,100
with bombardier transportation

00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:18,860
I joined Bombardier a couple of years

00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,080
back in 2015 when we had this

00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,939
transformation initiative where the

00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:25,820
company was taking a new turn towards

00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:27,800
how they want to structure is and how

00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,369
they want to bring their products so

00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,960
primarily I will focus today are more on

00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:35,350
how our digitalization journey takes

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:38,239
place and how we are more focusing on

00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:40,250
self-service data analytics yeah and

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,720
that that will be our depart to

00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:45,770
self-service cat analyticity and that

00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:47,390
will be the core of my speech there will

00:00:45,770 --> 00:00:49,670
be slight there are which are a little

00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:52,250
bit technical but I will not go into the

00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:55,160
technical details assuming this talk is

00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:57,050
more for intermediate audience but if

00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,640
you have some questions feel free to

00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:00,350
have it and at the end if there is time

00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,930
we can talk about it or I'm available

00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:07,250
outside you can we can make we can make

00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:09,890
a short talk on it because let's start

00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,540
with who are we so I think most of you

00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:14,240
know bombardier transportation so in

00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:16,909
short we make train sir

00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,380
that's a cool job right yeah of course

00:01:16,909 --> 00:01:21,070
yeah and our sister company makes

00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:24,470
flights or planes so that's even cooler

00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:27,440
but is it still cool yeah in this age I

00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:28,670
think people expect more from from the

00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:31,010
industry yeah so yes

00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:33,860
it's like it's a cool job but at the end

00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:36,680
the end customers at the moment are

00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:39,470
looking beyond what we call for as a

00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:43,100
traditional manufacturing yeah so it's

00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:46,940
no longer that you produce a traditional

00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:49,340
rolling stock or a train or a you bar

00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,770
but people are now looking at the

00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:54,530
next-gen transportation and this is

00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:57,290
basically our our transformation journey

00:01:54,530 --> 00:02:01,100
so how do we go ahead with our next

00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:03,229
generation transportation yeah so this

00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:06,229
is a very high-level advertisement slide

00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:08,450
for my company so we provide the

00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:10,700
broadest portfolio in rail industry not

00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:12,739
only in Europe but also across the globe

00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,780
there is a triple handle as well as the

00:02:12,739 --> 00:02:16,610
sights there are a lot of opportunities

00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,830
available those who are interested

00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,400
please go to our sites and look for for

00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:24,790
them

00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:28,660
so so we start with who are we and where

00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:30,730
are we moving to and how so where are we

00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:33,150
moving to so we are moving to giving

00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:35,770
customer Next Generation X Generation

00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:38,020
travel experience what does this mean

00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:43,390
that this means that you are always

00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:45,880
connected you get the modern-day apps in

00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:48,160
your in your mobile and you are always

00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:51,340
connected with the high-speed Internet

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,320
of course everybody were focus is about

00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,330
safety and capacity which gives us more

00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,130
profitability but at the same time we

00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:59,740
also have to focus on innovation yeah if

00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:01,870
you want to compete in this industry as

00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:05,380
you see already that there is a big cake

00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:07,390
over from or not just ago was also a

00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:11,080
consolidation in this industry taking

00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:16,870
place from our Asian and competitors as

00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:20,260
well oh so and how so this is basically

00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:23,200
my talk about so we are planning to

00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:25,060
utilize the big data stack basically to

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,820
bring in creative analytics and data

00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:30,250
science so focus on this speech would be

00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:33,480
more about two use cases one on the

00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:37,690
technical ability how we bring in our

00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:41,500
our big data stack and how self-service

00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:43,450
is important and how certain security

00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,910
and the compliance requirements made us

00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:47,860
to think about self-service and not just

00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:49,810
depend on the core IT back-end systems

00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:51,549
and the second use case would be more

00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,260
about data science lab where I talk

00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:56,709
about a business problem and how we were

00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:58,810
able to handle this of course there is

00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:00,760
from the manufacturing side we have to

00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:04,600
go for a smart automation which is not

00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:07,739
covered by but this is this this needs

00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:10,840
some foundational foundational

00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:13,660
capabilities to be enabled by our big

00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,370
data and predictive analytics TAC at the

00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,299
same time we're also partnering with the

00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,870
internal and external customers

00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:21,070
basically the startups to bring in some

00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:25,090
next-gen apps that could be integrated

00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:26,500
to our train systems and also we work we

00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,910
are we plan to work with the

00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,010
universities there are some talks going

00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:31,800
on which I will probably show in our

00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:34,240
next

00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,130
so what does it mean to us so let's

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,200
start start with what does it mean to

00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:41,889
our trains so basically we want to

00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:45,130
provide big data capabilities and also

00:04:41,889 --> 00:04:50,080
give us an open API so do our customers

00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:51,820
and partners for example Netflix can can

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,030
connect to our platform and then based

00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:57,340
on this user who is traveling will get

00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:59,620
ok you were seeing last hour you are of

00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:04,240
18 Game of Thrones or you are awaiting

00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:06,669
your favorite sitcom and basically you

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,430
can it gives you the suggestions and you

00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:11,110
can go ahead with viewing it during the

00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:12,550
period of journey that you have of

00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:16,300
course this means there is needs to be

00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:18,160
an next gen next generation networks and

00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,530
there needs to be some kind of an

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,720
analytics that needs to be done for our

00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,520
trains and then of course we have data

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,380
science so the ones that are highlighted

00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,060
is Big Data and data science just to

00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,490
showcase that I'm not going to touch the

00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:33,790
other parts now although some of the

00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,640
slides will will have these captions

00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:38,289
embedded in them

00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:41,470
the second is what it means to our

00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:44,530
productivity so the here we talk about

00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:46,990
industry 4.0 how to bring in IOT s I

00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:49,419
know sensors and robotics have already

00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:51,490
been integral part yeah but not in case

00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:53,830
of traditional train manufacturing

00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:57,030
systems so basically how to use robotics

00:05:53,830 --> 00:06:01,860
to automate our shop floor activities

00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:01,860
and finally paperless and lean factories

00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:09,220
and what does this mean to IT so because

00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:12,039
I am from the IT department which we now

00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:15,010
call it as digitalization department or

00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:17,550
program where we talk about mobility so

00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:20,950
how to bring in mobile apps and how to

00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:23,320
make it paperless and serve so and more

00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:25,660
self-service how to loop in it although

00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:27,280
it says ask platforms it's not just us

00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:30,840
but how to bring in the next gen cloud

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:36,690
platforms enabled for our for our

00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:36,690
applications and also about eLearning

00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:41,919
so this is the accelerator program that

00:06:39,849 --> 00:06:44,559
I talked about so basically we are at

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:48,189
the moment working with our

00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:49,659
working with a couple of startup to do

00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:52,149
some kind of predictive analytics on

00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:55,019
cash flow the idle urban design trio are

00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:58,029
various my transport is basically and

00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:58,539
360-degree app that connects so where am

00:06:58,029 --> 00:07:00,249
I

00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:03,789
what's the parking facilities available

00:07:00,249 --> 00:07:05,649
what's my transportation options can I

00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:07,689
rent a car can I go the public transport

00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:14,049
so that kind of information that it

00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:15,609
gives now so this is still in in in

00:07:14,049 --> 00:07:18,609
proposal let's say that's why I say we

00:07:15,609 --> 00:07:20,499
we are still in in our radar so nothing

00:07:18,609 --> 00:07:22,539
is find yet but we are looking forward

00:07:20,499 --> 00:07:25,629
to work with them so anyone interested

00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:27,399
from startups can also reach our site is

00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:29,649
mentioned here or you can reach me and I

00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:32,049
can connect to the corresponding program

00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:34,599
heads if you have a cool idea that would

00:07:32,049 --> 00:07:40,179
also help us to take us to the next

00:07:34,599 --> 00:07:42,149
generation okay so enough of this so

00:07:40,179 --> 00:07:44,859
let's say let's go into the use case so

00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:46,899
what can you take from this short speech

00:07:44,859 --> 00:07:49,659
so it's a 20-minute speech I think I

00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:51,789
already used more or less ten minutes

00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:55,689
here so basically I want to start with a

00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:58,209
very very simple use case where how

00:07:55,689 --> 00:08:00,699
self-service analytics actually helped

00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:02,499
us our self-service data preparation and

00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:06,399
data wrangling data and blending helped

00:08:02,499 --> 00:08:08,949
us to enable our data Lake and the

00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:11,639
second use case is more about a business

00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:14,889
problem that we will talk about and how

00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:19,089
self-service and enabled to bring

00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:21,309
solutions faster so let's start with the

00:08:19,089 --> 00:08:23,289
data Lake so this is our conceptual

00:08:21,309 --> 00:08:25,659
architecture so we have our trains which

00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:29,049
is basically getting all the information

00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:31,689
what we call it a system of records from

00:08:29,049 --> 00:08:34,240
this we try to get this both from

00:08:31,689 --> 00:08:36,429
on-prem or what we call as wayside which

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,519
is basically coming from the trains or

00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:42,669
the tracks is getting ingested into our

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:45,759
data like platform and this is basically

00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:47,800
fed into an experimentation of product

00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,959
prototyping environment what we call as

00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,179
data science lab so here we develop

00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:54,160
models we check if this works and what

00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:55,750
kind of business value does it bring is

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,090
it

00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,280
is it good enough to in displace it now

00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:04,510
so that it goes back to our system of

00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:08,590
record and and produces a value to our

00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:11,740
value chain so very very small kind of

00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:14,130
Alexei Mickey Mouse diagram to just show

00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:17,020
our high level conceptual architecture

00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:20,170
in terms of layers so this is how it

00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:23,560
looks so we we have a base from from

00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:24,940
untrim to our data like platform it's

00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,500
going to there is going to be enjoying

00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:30,520
just an layer and then followed by a

00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:32,560
storage as any of architectural

00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,200
principles that we also tried to

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,580
separate our storage from processing

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,310
that's why we have it storage and sub

00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:42,190
processing separately and followed by an

00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:47,020
inside layer yeah so what does the

00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:48,610
technical stack look like so we used all

00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:50,800
tricks and Python to prepare the data

00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:55,570
before ingestion and why we will see

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:58,240
this in the next slide s3 is our core

00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:00,280
storage layer and then comes the

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,610
processing basically redshift and EMR so

00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,839
strictly speaking like shift is not

00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:09,040
decoupled from storage although we

00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:11,260
primarily focus here more about using

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,620
redshift as an analytical data base and

00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:18,280
EMR is our SD Hadoop stack so basically

00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:20,050
we are our our our principle is that we

00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,589
don't build anything we always try to

00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:25,300
buy because that's not our core business

00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:27,460
so we build trains are not software so

00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:30,280
we always go for anything that comes out

00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:34,120
of the box and finally we have a stack

00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:35,740
for for inside where again we try to use

00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,630
all tricks on tableau which is basically

00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,460
a self-service for business as well as

00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:41,230
technical users and then we have a

00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:44,290
machine learning primarily focusing on

00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:51,370
our data science lab environment used by

00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:53,920
data engineers and data scientist so why

00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:56,740
why did we go for a preparation before

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,210
ingestion so last year when we started

00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,190
the our couple of years when we started

00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:01,990
the initiative we made for a lot of

00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:04,810
pilots and then we decided we go with

00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:07,870
AWS as our core platform although we

00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:08,800
didn't we didn't put aside all the

00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,870
others

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,399
but it start of this year when

00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,870
everything was ready there was a press

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,519
release that we are going live with our

00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:18,640
data light environment and we will go

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,680
with a pilot for our connected trains we

00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,390
had a kind of a road block which states

00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,769
which comes always from security and

00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,620
compliance right so this is always the

00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:29,140
case not that this is wrong but this is

00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,910
an awakening call for us just four weeks

00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:35,800
before Gola we were so told that we had

00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:37,600
to have some kind of and compliance we

00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,790
need to follow compliance on data

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,060
masking and a non-elimination of

00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:44,470
personal data so this comes from both

00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:46,420
workers consul point of view because we

00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,310
cannot have personal data of employees

00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:51,329
there which means that there will be

00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:54,940
some kind of a 360-degree evaluation of

00:11:51,329 --> 00:11:58,029
of employees which is strictly opposing

00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:59,890
what workers council from workers

00:11:58,029 --> 00:12:02,230
Thomson point of view which was not our

00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:04,420
intention as well yeah and the same

00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:08,980
comes from the you data privacy which is

00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:10,779
not yet in life but it will come in 2018

00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,000
so we already was forward-looking okay

00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:16,420
how to make sure that these data privacy

00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,670
requirements are or handled before being

00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:21,550
just data into our data like of course

00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,810
strictly confidential data as is key for

00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,730
our customers as well as for our

00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:30,459
business we cannot let anything go away

00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:35,140
from buy to get get hacked by our and

00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:37,120
lose our so-called proprietary designs

00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,950
and models so of course we have to do

00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:41,829
for strictly confidential data must be

00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:43,450
client-side encrypted and how the core

00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:47,589
is not about the technical problem of

00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:50,709
how to encrypt or how to how to arrive

00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:54,940
or how to meet them but how to take how

00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:58,839
to make it much more how to make it much

00:12:54,940 --> 00:13:00,839
more transparent for the customers in

00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:02,890
this case the customer is to be a

00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:04,420
representative from the workers Council

00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:08,260
or it could be a representative from

00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:10,029
legal and data privacy departments or it

00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:12,699
could be just in any or any end-user

00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:15,820
within the company so how to make this

00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:18,310
transparent so that v from central IT

00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:20,110
don't get bogged down by this that

00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:22,000
everyone comes to us and says ok now can

00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,550
you give me this audit trail or can you

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,470
now give me

00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:25,790
this audit logs so we don't want to get

00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,740
bucked on with this because we want to

00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:29,959
proceed with providing the next layers

00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:33,860
and next upgrading our stack so how to

00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:36,290
make this much more giving it to the

00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:40,610
end-users like a self-service and this

00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:42,680
is this is key for us so on the left

00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:44,300
side is more the technical side which I

00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:46,339
say as I said I will not talk about we

00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:48,560
already saw the block diagrams which

00:13:46,339 --> 00:13:51,230
talked about the storage computation

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,730
layers but I focus more on the right

00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:56,839
side basically we have a governance

00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:58,310
structure all handled by ultrix which

00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:00,740
basically goes into a secure server

00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:03,380
database and sharepoint which sits on

00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,970
our untrim so what is the reason because

00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:09,070
we want to make sure that any data

00:14:04,970 --> 00:14:12,860
before it goes into cloud is audited and

00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:15,769
stored in our governance framework and

00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:17,690
this is basically we have a data like

00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:20,450
client API so but that's basically

00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:22,610
written in Python which basically

00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:24,110
consumes this from at the end of the

00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:26,779
arctic's workflow then we take this data

00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:30,320
and put into our injection layer so what

00:14:26,779 --> 00:14:32,930
do we do here the framework is basically

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:35,990
saying capturing what is the data what

00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:38,779
is requested by the customer what is the

00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:42,020
assessment in Vonage the assessment what

00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:44,930
is the classification of this data is

00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:47,899
data owners have have they approved who

00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:50,120
need to get access to this how do we

00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:52,430
integrate this with our metadata

00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:54,800
management classifications of our

00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:57,290
catalog management how do we compress

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,300
upload and all this catalog of

00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:02,570
information needs to be somehow managed

00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:04,910
and and that can be readable later or

00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:09,589
can be auditable later when someone

00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:12,170
needs to go through this and of course

00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:14,270
then it should also be scalable so that

00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:18,170
it's we now start with a very very

00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:20,390
limited scope of data which is basically

00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:22,970
coming from our wayside but once we

00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:26,029
start integrating our core systems like

00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:28,670
citizen on on from then we need to be

00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:31,699
able to scale this also as well and

00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:34,220
that's that's the core of it what is the

00:15:31,699 --> 00:15:36,019
key takeaway so with with the data

00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:38,300
preparation tool what we were able to do

00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:40,249
is we were able to get an into and

00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,619
artist raishin of the process so that

00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:45,139
all of this what we said can be all

00:15:42,619 --> 00:15:47,209
bundled together we could easily track

00:15:45,139 --> 00:15:48,769
them at any point if someone comes and

00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:51,499
says okay what was the data that was

00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:53,660
moved in last 15 days with this

00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:57,379
confidentiality it was easy to provide a

00:15:53,660 --> 00:16:00,739
report not by a central IT but someone

00:15:57,379 --> 00:16:06,199
from the core business or from the

00:16:00,739 --> 00:16:08,329
complaints as well moving on to the

00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:11,569
second so basically this use case is

00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:14,480
more about business problem so we have a

00:16:11,569 --> 00:16:17,299
problem there we we know what is the

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,579
overstock in stores and we also know

00:16:17,299 --> 00:16:21,769
what what we deliver to the customer but

00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:23,839
this is a typical manufacturing problem

00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:25,429
that once your stock moves into your

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,860
production line there is no clear

00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:29,869
visibility so people are always running

00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,939
around the chasing blindfolded because

00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:34,339
they have no no clue ok what is being

00:16:31,939 --> 00:16:37,069
now in which production line what is my

00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:38,989
cost that is trapped before that is not

00:16:37,069 --> 00:16:41,569
being delivered to our customer so this

00:16:38,989 --> 00:16:43,699
is key because what we found this 80% of

00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:46,369
our cost was tracked in this production

00:16:43,699 --> 00:16:49,759
line and this is a big risk for us when

00:16:46,369 --> 00:16:51,860
it comes to our cash flow so we had a

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,209
typical problem there is nothing new so

00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,949
we had data quality issues we had

00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:58,100
multiple year P systems we had more than

00:16:54,949 --> 00:17:01,850
one standard processes we had greater

00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:05,480
granularity issues in our BW we could

00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:07,370
not do cleaning of data and people and

00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,899
business we're more looking for an agile

00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:10,220
and fast spending solution are or else

00:17:08,899 --> 00:17:12,919
they want to just put in Excel and

00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:14,959
deliver some report which is degree but

00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:18,860
it's not the reports that our president

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:21,860
wanted to see so what did we do so this

00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:23,990
is a kind of a lab environment so it's

00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:25,880
not a disliked industrialized solution

00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:27,169
so as in the previous talk someone

00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:29,590
mentioned so this is more for our

00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:34,130
scientists to work with yeah so we take

00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:36,169
the Corre ERP systems we tied up we we

00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:39,409
kind of do a data preparation and

00:17:36,169 --> 00:17:41,600
wrangling an enrichment using all tricks

00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:44,570
they also did develop some kind of and

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,340
core models using our but then this

00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:48,000
could be imported into Alex to run the

00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,830
end-to-end workflows

00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,720
and finally we have to also enrich it

00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:53,129
with some master data because once it

00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,600
goes back to the business then they need

00:17:53,129 --> 00:17:58,860
to be able to see it in their language

00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:02,309
yeah and then we visualized reports in

00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:04,019
in tableau so this is the let's say the

00:18:02,309 --> 00:18:06,539
overarching solution that we had in

00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:08,789
place but I go into three cases just to

00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:12,090
show what has what was done so the first

00:18:08,789 --> 00:18:13,799
is very simple flow where we in any

00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,600
company this is the case that is master

00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:18,269
data is not harmonized it's not

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,789
maintained in our core ERP systems there

00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:22,860
is no standards and in case of bombarda

00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:24,840
this is our this was obvious because we

00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,610
as a company grew by acquisitions so

00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:30,240
there were always more than one company

00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:31,559
behind the core labeled company so what

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,889
does this mean so we had to run

00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:37,320
different workflows and to bring all

00:18:34,889 --> 00:18:39,149
this data into a kind of lab environment

00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,159
to to harmonize them and this

00:18:39,149 --> 00:18:42,809
organization could be done if it was

00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:47,639
self-service by the business themselves

00:18:42,809 --> 00:18:50,580
and not depend on the IT the second

00:18:47,639 --> 00:18:52,950
problem again typical problem in any

00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,970
manufacturing side so we have a cost

00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,529
allocation problem

00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,210
so from Finance point of view this was

00:18:55,529 --> 00:19:00,570
never a problem because finance always

00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:02,759
had a different model for to calculate

00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:05,100
this which was sitting in a BW and they

00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:07,500
were not focused on the granular data

00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:10,019
yeah but from operational point of view

00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,879
this is this was very very important to

00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:15,120
calculate certain KPI yeah so for

00:19:11,879 --> 00:19:17,519
example what is the amount of what was

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,980
the amount that was spent in painting or

00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:21,870
repainting this kind of information does

00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:24,059
not come from financier so basically we

00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:27,389
need to go to a level where the data is

00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:29,279
maintained in the core si P cables I

00:19:27,389 --> 00:19:31,379
don't know how many of you know some

00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:34,919
tables like like material movement or m

00:19:31,379 --> 00:19:37,230
cig which basically has like millions or

00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:41,190
sometimes even billions of rows yeah so

00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:45,389
we have to go to this tables to to to to

00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:48,720
see how the costs are assigned to to a

00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:50,490
certain product and in cases where we

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,379
could not directly assign them we have

00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:54,360
to reassign them we have to create

00:19:52,379 --> 00:19:56,129
models to reassign them and this models

00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,710
differ depending on the business

00:19:56,129 --> 00:20:00,090
departments so this is another key so

00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:01,560
where we could design a model and then

00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:03,960
give it back to the business

00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:06,620
who could just put them some kind of

00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:09,000
input and output processing parameters

00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:11,430
thresholds and then say okay this is the

00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:17,280
optimized cost allocation that we could

00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:19,470
get to the finally we had another core

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,920
problem with the building and hierarchy

00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:24,660
this so this is any company any

00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:26,310
manufacturing or product this company

00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:27,990
will have a bill of material what is

00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:29,910
basically saying okay how does your

00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:33,330
product break down or breakdown

00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:35,430
structure and sometimes this structure

00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:38,130
was not available when you are producing

00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:41,550
this goods internally so basically if

00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:43,230
you have a what we call as a build and

00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:44,430
axles it is produced internally but

00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:46,290
there is no bill of material because

00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:47,940
it's just a wheel but at the end it has

00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:50,670
to be also produced so that someone has

00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:53,490
to know how this is done and in such

00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:56,220
cases we have to build our own hierarchy

00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:58,350
to which is basically coming from

00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,780
material movements again millions of

00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:02,940
millions of rows so why I highlighted

00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:05,070
all this is if the same has to be done

00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:08,100
in a traditional VI VW there was an

00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:10,170
entire dependency on our core IT which

00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:13,230
would probably take months or even years

00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:15,870
to implement this as a project but we

00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:17,340
were not interested in like an hundred

00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:19,920
was an accurate solution we were more

00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:22,320
interested in 80% tell us what it is

00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:25,230
even if someone says ok 80% gives your

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:27,810
value of your cost is stuck in somewhere

00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:31,740
here then this was a big bonus for our

00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:34,440
business to take some actions on it so

00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:36,930
we were if we took just raw cables

00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:39,300
skipping all the application levels then

00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:42,390
we started to process them like billions

00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:44,220
of rows like 500 gigabyte of raw data we

00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:46,680
created models based on the inputs from

00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:49,830
business users and we gave it back to

00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:55,680
them to run them with an easy governance

00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:57,060
model on top of this and think I'm

00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,940
running out of time so but this is the

00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:01,560
last slide here so what is what was

00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:05,760
expected and why did we choose all

00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:08,040
tricks so this is an we were expected to

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:11,550
provide an agile prototyping prototyping

00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:13,830
environment so there was no one willing

00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:15,130
to say ok now we run a project that goes

00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:17,110
for two years and then we

00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:20,110
you what happens so this was not the

00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:21,760
case speed wasn't in requirement yeah so

00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:23,530
everybody said that we have to crunch

00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,220
lot of data but this has to happen in

00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:29,370
hours and not even in days so this was a

00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:33,610
genuine requirement then we have to

00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:36,280
because of the our landscape it was a

00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:38,200
kind of a messed up data sources yeah so

00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:41,410
we have to bring them all together link

00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,900
them this data and provide the insights

00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:46,480
which is also shareable across our

00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:48,610
organization and that's where Isaac's

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,650
gallery was really helpful to provide

00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:54,490
very very simple the wunens model that

00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:57,310
helped us to provide such an such a

00:22:54,490 --> 00:23:00,400
collaborative and sharing model across

00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:03,700
our organization as I said before our

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,710
motto is always we go for whenever there

00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,360
is a pie then we buy the solution rather

00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:10,510
than build on its own although we are

00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,340
changing now because of our data science

00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:14,050
environment also with our working with

00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,090
our startups so we are also trying to

00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:17,740
build but then we when there is minimum

00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:20,200
customization then we try to prefer this

00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:23,620
which was perfect for us with with

00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,270
ultrix most important the license model

00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:27,130
because there was no need for us to

00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:28,630
provide an heavy investment cost so the

00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:31,300
first use case that I mentioned if we

00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:33,910
were to go for a traditional catalog

00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:36,700
management or an ETL or data preparation

00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:40,450
tool we would have gone spending at

00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:43,090
least 500k in cost but in this case it

00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:44,830
was very very easy and finally we had

00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:46,600
excellent partners I don't know if

00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:49,240
someone from information slab is here

00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:52,840
but they were really good in bringing us

00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:54,220
on board as well as our end users there

00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,100
is lot of materials and blocks available

00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:59,860
and the all the open source models that

00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:01,300
are available works perfectly fine you

00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:03,010
can import them you can input all the

00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:06,430
our models into a tricks and you can

00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:09,460
also run them through so thank you all

00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:12,280
I think I'm three minutes or more but if

00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:15,070
you want some questions we can we can

00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:16,840
still go through or do i yeah we don't

00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:19,030
have any time because it's like five

00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,880
minutes the next talk so okay so I got

00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:23,860
you are here and I can I can I can stay

00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,900
here outside and anybody want me to

00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:27,190
speak in person - Gopi thank you very

00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,130
much go here

00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:33,189
pick applause thank you

00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:33,189
