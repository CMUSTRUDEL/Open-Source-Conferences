Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2017: Juan de Dios Santos Rivera - Anti-Spam and Machine learning at LOVOO #bbuzz
Publication date: 2017-06-15
Playlist: Berlin Buzzwords 2017
Description: 
	Spam is defined as the unauthorized use of a platform to send unsolicited content, usually in the form of advertising, to its user base with the purpose of generating views and revenue. LOVOO is a dating platform with over 50 millions registered users, making it attractive to spammers. Due to the nature of the service (a dating platform) many of the spammers disguise themselves as real users, using believable images and genuine descriptions on their profiles to lure our users into believing they are real people. 

To achieve the goal of keeping our platform free of spam, LOVOOâ€™s dedicated anti-spam team relies heavily on machine learning and massive real-time data processing. So far, we are winning this fight. As seen in our latest Fake and Spam Transparency Report, on a daily basis, only 0.3 percent of the active users are spammers, and on average it takes around 2.2 hours to detect them.

In this presentation I will talk about how the anti-spam platform works, and will present some insights and statistics about our findings.

thank you thank you guys ah so good

00:00:09,799 --> 00:00:14,209
afternoon my friends my name is 1 and I

00:00:11,629 --> 00:00:16,340
am a software engineer big data at logu

00:00:14,209 --> 00:00:18,289
and today is a really really special day

00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,970
I'll be honest with you and the reason

00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:22,249
is because first it is actually my first

00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,589
time speaking in a conference um really

00:00:22,249 --> 00:00:25,880
happen excited to be here and second of

00:00:24,589 --> 00:00:28,759
course because I'll be talking about

00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:29,240
machine learning and anti-spam so let's

00:00:28,759 --> 00:00:31,609
begin

00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,260
this is the agenda for today first I'll

00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:35,840
be talking about span at Naboo who are

00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,910
the spammer how do they behave followed

00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,170
by this I'll show how do we detect the

00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:42,020
now how to be blocked and how do we

00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,789
fight the spammers and lastly I'll show

00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,239
some insights on numbers some graph

00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:49,609
regarding how the system is performing

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:52,010
however before studying what is love and

00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:54,050
love with a taking up meaning that we

00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,910
have a bunch of pretty people that are

00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,250
flirting which is order hunting polish

00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:00,379
order and most importantly trying to

00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:05,750
find that sweet love that we all like

00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:08,330
and adore but yeah what is spam well I

00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:11,750
like to define span as the unauthorized

00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:15,020
use of a system or a platform to send

00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:17,450
display or just to communicate also

00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,720
elicited and disrupting content that

00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:22,340
usually comes on the way of

00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,500
advertisement now the goal of this

00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:27,170
advertisement is of course to generate

00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:31,100
some kind of revenues views or any sort

00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:32,630
of profit but this luck the guide is

00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,729
really really bad because we are

00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:36,950
updating up so we have people trying to

00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:39,320
find all the real users who want to

00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:41,299
spend time with them and these two

00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,930
participants they are getting on the way

00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:43,850
of that

00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,439
because I've used in genuine images in

00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:47,869
their profile they use really good

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,329
description to learn our users into

00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:51,799
believing that they are real I mean for

00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:53,840
example just imagine that is Friday

00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:55,100
night and you are on Netflix doing

00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,840
nothing in your house you swipe in

00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:58,789
slightly annoying pin and you get it's

00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,110
really good much and they just start

00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:01,250
talking with the match about boom

00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,899
spammer

00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:05,270
you're going to get really sad you know

00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:07,189
and it has a lot of negative effects for

00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:08,840
example it damaged the image of the

00:02:07,189 --> 00:02:10,970
product because I want people to think

00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,940
of logo as this amazing place to find

00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:16,010
love and adventures also it is truck our

00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,290
customer support because the people they

00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:19,069
call customer support live here spammers

00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,629
here on

00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:22,909
on and then support they had to take

00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:24,469
care of the ticket they sent emails to

00:02:22,909 --> 00:02:26,060
everyone so it takes time and you know

00:02:24,469 --> 00:02:29,510
what they say time keep cost money and

00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:31,189
lastly it makes our users sad so they

00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:35,840
quit the platform and they I'll be the

00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:37,849
one who's going to get sad okay but how

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,620
the spammer behaved and here I have this

00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:42,170
asterisk because most of the spammers

00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:46,010
they are actually boss otherwise it will

00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:47,959
be kind of easy to touch them and I like

00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:50,299
to define our farmers into one of two

00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:52,250
categories we have the active spammers

00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:54,560
and the passive one and they've all of

00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:56,870
the active spammer is to really really

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,269
try to engage into conversation with you

00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:02,419
and for doing this they use a bunch of

00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:04,099
pretty picture of RTS Instagram and you

00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:05,870
guys have no idea how many Brad Pitt of

00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:08,299
Scala Johansson I have seen on the app

00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:10,510
and when you are in the conversation

00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:13,159
then boom they stand you with on ADD or

00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,989
blackmail or even prostitution services

00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:16,730
and I mean answer for some of things

00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:19,159
quite cool but that's something we don't

00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:20,959
allow in the app on the other hand we

00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:22,790
have the passive spammer and this one

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,470
they just write a really simple

00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:26,959
advertisement in their status and that

00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,879
they both both both both so when you get

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,370
the both notification you go to the

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:34,009
profile and you are going to see the

00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:37,009
message and this is an example of a

00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:39,019
Thamud profile okay the picture is

00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:40,729
uploading is really weird but just

00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:45,829
imagine there's a French girl here

00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:48,919
called Roxanne 24 French but whoa fake

00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:52,189
this is not Roxanne and Jesus Lord and

00:03:48,919 --> 00:03:53,959
but here you can see that about me and

00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:56,359
there's a bunch of tags and it basically

00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:57,049
say that recently I broke up with my

00:03:56,359 --> 00:03:58,159
boyfriend

00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:00,290
I'm looking for a friend with benefits

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,259
to have some fun so if you would like to

00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,919
have sex on camera please email me at

00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:07,310
this address

00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:09,079
come on this is fun who is going to do

00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:12,530
this I'll just write me here for her sex

00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:14,329
yeah whatever but how do we clean the

00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:16,880
garbage what are we doing to get rid of

00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:19,789
all these spammers will say hello to

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,590
Auntie Stan now at the Spanish our Buick

00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:24,009
system for detecting and controlling

00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:27,169
spammers and it is divided into multiple

00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:29,719
components and we like to call a piston

00:04:27,169 --> 00:04:32,000
an event-based system because it depends

00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:33,350
on all the events that are processed in

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,479
the Attic

00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:37,729
for example every time you vote for one

00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:39,440
person or every time you send a message

00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:42,169
or every time you block someone those

00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,690
are events now every time you perform an

00:04:42,169 --> 00:04:46,370
event it goes to our back-end which is

00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:49,370
there on top which is reading in goal

00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:51,800
and note on PHP and then the back end is

00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:54,020
going to emit is going to push the

00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:56,240
content of these events into Casca with

00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:59,270
functions of our backbone or the heart

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,530
of an T span on the other hand the skies

00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:03,380
also facilitate the communication

00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:04,850
between our component because first it

00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,430
provides the data that we need of course

00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,690
and second it less than communicate

00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,760
between each other

00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:12,650
so if component a wants to know

00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:14,330
something about component B instead of

00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:16,370
asking directly it's going to be like yo

00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:18,500
Casca do you have had this information

00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,600
about this user sure bro I haven't Incas

00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:24,650
guys going to provided by keeping the

00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,970
state of the component but now you see

00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,940
here that and Hispanics based on

00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:31,669
different components however just five

00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:33,800
of them they're actually used to fight

00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:35,900
the spammers out of these five two of

00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,060
them are non machine learning based and

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,010
the rest are machine learning based and

00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,780
well today I'm going to be focusing on

00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:43,550
the machine learning ones I'll give a

00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:46,010
really really quick recap of what our

00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:48,110
than non machine learning models first

00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:50,570
we have them drool baseless then it's

00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:52,639
basically a bunch of lists and rules

00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:55,250
that if they are violated by the user

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,320
then the user is going to get punished

00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,330
for example we have the IP blacklist

00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:02,479
if you come from IP X then you are out

00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:05,630
or we have the terms blackness if you

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:08,960
write this random word on the text like

00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:10,789
but names and such then punished and

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,979
then we also have the community and the

00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:15,409
community is the responsible of keeping

00:06:12,979 --> 00:06:17,210
track of how many reports a profile

00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:19,940
receives in a short amount of time for

00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,800
example if I receive 15 user reports in

00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,930
one hour I'm sure that I'm doing

00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,250
something really really wrong so we are

00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,800
going to detect that and what going to

00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:30,080
happen punished yeah we like to punish

00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,550
people here but come on let's move to

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,289
the good ones the machine learning base

00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:36,080
and here I'll be talking about three of

00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:40,039
them activity base report clustering and

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:42,139
entity reputation so activity base model

00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:44,750
this one follows a super busy learning

00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:46,670
approach and we use a random forest of

00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:48,590
around 800 trees

00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:50,450
give it'll take and it's really simple

00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,790
you know it classifies a user into

00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:56,000
either a spammer a bad person or a

00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:57,860
hammer a good person and the model uses

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,650
over steady features that are related to

00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:02,810
how the user behaves in other words we

00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:06,380
do not care of who you are we care about

00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:08,180
what you do and some of the values of

00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:11,840
these features are the absolute number

00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:14,030
of execution of a certain event or the

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,900
proportion of an event with respect to

00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:20,870
other events this is an example of my

00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:23,750
really huge training set got so big and

00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:25,160
here we have user ABCD and we can see in

00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,040
the first column we have the event

00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:31,340
called message blog and for user a the

00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:33,650
value is 2016 meaning that of all the

00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:35,870
use of all the events that this user has

00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:39,020
performed 16 percent of them has been

00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:42,980
message blog but on the last column we

00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:45,170
have the event today log in and today

00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,300
log in is the absolute number of times

00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:52,580
that the user has logged in in the last

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:54,500
X hours and this is how the system works

00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:56,960
I'm gonna tell you a little story here

00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,660
and ask with everything's big data it

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,420
starts with a loop in a do we keep our

00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:05,660
historical data all our events and then

00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:08,060
here we execute a bunch of spark jobs to

00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,950
calculate the features and why spark and

00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:12,260
when so many well because we are

00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:14,330
calculated on three features and some of

00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:16,430
them related to the distance of the user

00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:18,620
so just imagine that if the person moves

00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,360
50 times during one day so we need to

00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:22,070
take that into consideration so this is

00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,620
really really really heavy load for the

00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:27,470
system then after we have our data our

00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,360
features we move to our and in our we

00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:32,060
prototype the model we select feature

00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,910
with the move feature we do a player we

00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:36,440
remove the outlier we calculate you know

00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:37,040
everything just prototype in the whole

00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,229
system

00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:42,140
and after we decide that this model is

00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:44,330
good enough like it is good then we move

00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:47,860
to our activity based model we deployed

00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:51,350
existing into production however however

00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,940
in our and this is in Golan so we need

00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:55,460
some kind of intermediate steps to

00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:57,620
convert this from A to D and so we have

00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:59,510
this kind of model generation that is

00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,410
going to take our our model and it's

00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:03,829
going to convert

00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:05,810
that into gold code and the responsible

00:09:03,829 --> 00:09:09,199
for that is here that guy so any

00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:11,060
questions go to him and of course we

00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:13,430
have Kafka but after going to keep

00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:15,440
updating us of all this of all the

00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:17,569
updates of the users so every time we

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,319
receive a new object then we are going

00:09:17,569 --> 00:09:21,829
to trigger a new prediction then the

00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:24,110
next one

00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:26,209
the default clustering and unlike the

00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:29,060
first one the ripple clustering features

00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:31,399
a of supervised learning approach and it

00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:34,189
uses a some kind of hone made online

00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:36,500
version of k-means and maybe some of you

00:09:34,189 --> 00:09:37,790
here know what it K means but the main

00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,220
difference between the traditional

00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:42,170
k-means and ours is that it's online

00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,839
while always learning on the go so we

00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:45,589
learn we predict we learn we predict

00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:49,730
it's like dancing you know

00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:52,790
tatata so then after we have that after

00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:55,639
we have the system the the purpose of it

00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:58,069
is to detect and to combat span wave but

00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:59,779
how do we do this well we create dynamic

00:09:58,069 --> 00:10:01,759
rules for the root system that I

00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:04,189
mentioned previously and this rules are

00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:06,500
based on content type that is being

00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:09,680
reported by the user a bit confusing

00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:11,689
right but yeah and here once again

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,939
another story but this time the story

00:10:11,689 --> 00:10:17,000
does not start with Hadoop this time is

00:10:13,939 --> 00:10:19,040
start with a report so let's say that if

00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,199
you look like a spammer and I'm running

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,149
to you and then you write me hey sexy

00:10:21,199 --> 00:10:25,699
please visit me a hot steamy sex calm

00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:28,100
I'll be like bro no you are a spammer so

00:10:25,699 --> 00:10:30,290
I'm going to report you boom after I'll

00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,550
report you then I'm going to create I'm

00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:34,850
going to trigger something called the

00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:37,610
report created event and attach to this

00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:39,470
report created event we will have the

00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,600
last message sent but the person that

00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:44,480
was reported so I'm going to receive

00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,069
this new event with this string the next

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,350
step is going to convert the string into

00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:50,600
a numerical vector after this to use the

00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:52,459
official Russian or Russian TF whatever

00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,790
you want to call it and then we cluster

00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:57,860
we closer this into our system and once

00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:01,579
we know to wish closer it belongs we

00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:03,949
calculate the average tf-idf of this

00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:06,139
content here and for those of you who

00:11:03,949 --> 00:11:08,120
are not so clear tf-idf stands for turn

00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:11,180
frequently inverts document frequency

00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:14,000
and it's basically a score that tells

00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:16,220
you how important a turn is to a talk

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,010
moment that belong to a set of documents

00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:21,320
and this guy my one document is one

00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:23,960
closer on my corpus my set of documents

00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,820
going to be the whole system but what

00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,160
happened now up to this page I have a

00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:30,860
bunch of tf-idf of all the content of

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:34,310
the cluster and I want to know is this

00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:37,250
the SIDS 9.8 if it is and uh normally if

00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:41,360
it is an outlier so for this I created

00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:44,210
or me on my own equation which I like to

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:47,620
call one just like me and one stands for

00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:51,230
ones or supervised anomaly number and

00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:53,570
this score is uses all the tf-idf and

00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:56,120
it's going to tell me if this number is

00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:59,570
indeed are not linear so if it is an

00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:02,150
outlier if my psi D F is greater than 1

00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:04,100
then this content is going to be

00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:07,250
converted into a rule for the rule

00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:09,500
system so the next time someone funny

00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:11,420
decide to write this again we're going

00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:13,070
to know that whoa this looks really

00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,990
similar to this other message that I

00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:20,270
have in the root system so what's going

00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:22,190
to happen punished next one the entity

00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:24,410
reputation and this one is quite similar

00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:26,600
to the first one because it also follows

00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:29,180
a stupor besides learning approach it

00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,070
uses a random forest and I can't tell

00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:34,400
you how many trees we have because this

00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:37,220
thing is built kind of on development

00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:39,740
and it classifies the user into a

00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:43,460
spammer but person or hammer good person

00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:46,070
but here here instead of looking at how

00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:48,470
the person behaves we have something

00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:50,660
called the entities and we call the

00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:54,500
entities or we define an entity as the

00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:56,810
resources or system that a user uses to

00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:59,930
communicate to the platform for example

00:12:56,810 --> 00:13:01,490
IP from which IP do you come from device

00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:03,380
which device are you using

00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:05,450
is it Android is it where is it iPhone

00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:07,850
and the conflicts from which country you

00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:10,160
are participating in the app and then

00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:12,290
for each one of this entity for each one

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,600
we have a set of counters that we call

00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:17,780
this course for example the users how

00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,310
many users come from IP X the punishment

00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:22,160
how many punishment has have been

00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:25,430
received in country Y and the default

00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,490
but we even go further than that are

00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:29,830
using a combination of

00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:33,250
discourse we calculate ratios and we

00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:35,140
call all these ratios dip the reputation

00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:37,480
and this is what we are going to use for

00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:39,130
predict and an example of one of the

00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,620
ratios is the ratio of punishment

00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:43,990
meaning that for example of all the

00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,899
people that come from I P 1 2 3 4 how

00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,580
many of them has been punished of all

00:13:46,899 --> 00:13:51,310
the people that are using Android what

00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:53,380
is the ratio of report so if we take all

00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:55,120
this course and we add them up if

00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:58,480
something is going to be like the

00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,120
likelihood of how spammy and entity is

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,680
because our assumption is that if there

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,690
isn't kind of spank wave or some kind of

00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:06,760
attack all the spammers are going to

00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:09,820
come from the same place so next time we

00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,649
receive an event from IP whatever and

00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:12,520
device whatever then we are going to

00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:14,589
know like hmm

00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:18,670
this is fishy I figured a spammer so

00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:20,050
what's going to happen punishment but

00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:21,850
now come on

00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:25,240
but now inside how is the system

00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:27,670
performing how does it look well here we

00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,370
have some draft and this one is called

00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:32,680
the reported users across month and on

00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:35,110
my white axis I have the percentage from

00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,970
the eleatic user in other words all the

00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:40,810
users that are active including one day

00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:42,880
and on the x1 I have all the days is the

00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:45,010
beginning of the year until a couple of

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,680
days ago and all those pretty colors

00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:50,500
they are countries Germany France and so

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:53,140
on but a really cool thing here is that

00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,600
first the average value is around the

00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:58,270
same 0.03 which is a really really

00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,920
really good number but booty Marsh I

00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:02,079
think the spammers they got a bit cocky

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,089
or something like that and they decide

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,070
to increase their activity and that's

00:15:04,089 --> 00:15:08,079
why we see that the trend is kind of

00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:10,510
increasing whoop-whoop however

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,700
unfortunately for them we have plans to

00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:15,220
deploy aware new activity based model on

00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:18,520
April understand why everything is going

00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:20,290
down down down the next one quite

00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,910
similar to the first one once again here

00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:24,279
we have the percentage from telly a

00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:26,470
diffuser and here all the basic the

00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:28,180
beginning of the year and the really

00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:30,820
cool thing here in the blue lines that

00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:32,410
we see the huge spike in April because

00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:35,410
that's when we deploy the new activity

00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:37,000
base model and after that the performer

00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:39,220
was really really good we're really

00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,320
surprised and a bunch of points on a

00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,910
bunch of people they got blocked

00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:46,779
and then now everything is going of it

00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:48,310
is kind of a stabilizing then we have

00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,959
the intuitive reputation we know have

00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:52,660
enough data about it because he's the

00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:55,930
new kid in town so we're still trying to

00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,550
get familiar with it and on the last so

00:15:55,930 --> 00:16:00,040
on the last place we have the dynamic

00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:01,600
rules or the report clustering which is

00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:04,079
being all wasted we get one but is

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:07,779
really two what it's supposed to do

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:10,149
then the spammers by country and here we

00:16:07,779 --> 00:16:12,339
can see that around 60% of them belong

00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:14,769
to France is your money or USA and this

00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:16,420
is really really really good because we

00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:17,860
know who they are you know we are like

00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,370
path you know you like your Spanish

00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,740
what's up

00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:23,110
so in some sense like we're kind of

00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:25,060
controlling them because we know from

00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:27,579
where they come from I mean for example

00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:30,009
is one day so that if we decide we see a

00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:31,449
bunch of spammers from country eggs then

00:16:30,009 --> 00:16:31,930
we're going to be like whoa what's going

00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:35,139
on here

00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:36,639
so this is really really nice and the

00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:38,139
last one and this one is completely

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,970
different from the others if this

00:16:38,139 --> 00:16:42,699
involves more machine learning base is

00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:45,760
an historian with the confidence value

00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:48,130
of the activity based model because when

00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:50,410
our activity based model it says that

00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:51,730
your spanner or hammer instead of doing

00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:54,670
that actually it give me the confidence

00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:57,250
value how confident I am that you are a

00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:58,750
spammer so we use that that score and

00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,250
some kind of post-processing just to

00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:02,709
make sure that you are really a spammer

00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:04,270
just to make the final decision but the

00:17:02,709 --> 00:17:07,449
really cool thing here is that either

00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:10,299
the value is like I'm not so sure or I'm

00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:11,799
really really really sure so I'm

00:17:10,299 --> 00:17:15,730
guessing that we are doing quite of the

00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:18,359
right thing so I think my friends are

00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:21,909
really okay yeah yeah whatever yeah

00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,909
[Laughter]

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,669
but-but-but any question feel free to

00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,770
spam me haha at any of our Twitter and

00:17:27,669 --> 00:17:30,330
yes they know to spam because Tom Sox

00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:35,260
yeah

00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:38,190
Spanish accent is any questions Jesus

00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,190
okay oh God

00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:46,779
about the machine learning part how do

00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:49,240
you handle SKU data great is your false

00:17:46,779 --> 00:17:52,510
positive they're false positive or I

00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:54,970
mean we have false positive I really am

00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:57,039
not sure if I can say name but we have

00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:58,630
around like two of them per hour you

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,270
know for example and how do we handle

00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:03,250
them well when okay I didn't explain but

00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:05,919
when I say punish we do not block the

00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:08,799
person we ask for a verification either

00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,630
by using XML verification or picture and

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,429
when we are really sure that you are a

00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:14,200
spammer then we ask for a picture so the

00:18:12,429 --> 00:18:16,809
person has to take one picture one says

00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:19,000
we haha and then we verified if the

00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:22,270
person is indeed the real user otherwise

00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,679
not so that's how we handle them so we

00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:25,000
own it there are some cases maybe we're

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:28,090
deaf person is like I don't want to

00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:32,190
verify myself and bla but you know this

00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:32,190
yeah that's something that happened so

00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:40,080
this data are I mean ah whatever is the

00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:47,590
fact if equation how do I handle that oh

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:50,590
yeah of course I mean yeah I mean okay

00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:52,570
sorry yeah but soon for everyone else

00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:54,510
basically spammers are less than normal

00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:56,860
the ayah uses so we have a skew in our

00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:59,289
training dataset yeah so you do use

00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:01,600
graduating or do you yeah

00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:03,700
manufacture I mean like like we used all

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,250
the classes but the thing is with one

00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,960
during training we actually our main

00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:09,760
focus is to reduce the number of false

00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,500
positive so for this we kind of tweaked

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,179
a lot the training set just to make sure

00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,640
that we are not jumped we're going to

00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:17,649
avoid that so we kind of balance we try

00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,289
to balance the amount of spammers on

00:19:17,649 --> 00:19:21,730
hammer because otherwise this that the

00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:23,679
model is going to no because it'll be

00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:25,539
very smart about the hammers but in a

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:29,020
lot of these farmers so we cannot try to

00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:32,669
kind of balance them at least like like

00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:36,279
2080 some something like that so

00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:36,659
like yeah yeah yeah hey thanks for your

00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:39,309
talk

00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:41,049
I was curious like you have a lot of

00:19:39,309 --> 00:19:43,059
text there who do think like

00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:45,309
incorporating some girls NLP features

00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:47,409
would really help you a lot yeah can you

00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:49,539
please repeat like incorporating some

00:19:47,409 --> 00:19:52,000
kind of NLP features like not just look

00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:54,159
into the popularity of a city or like

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,020
over where you have the ratio yeah I

00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:57,669
mean like because for a call stud thing

00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,440
it might be a problem like the first

00:19:57,669 --> 00:20:01,179
spammer and you have no spam report

00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,610
you'd say like yeah it's very good comes

00:20:01,179 --> 00:20:05,289
up but do me for the entity one yes like

00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:07,360
for a text so kind of looking into like

00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:09,490
how does the spam structure looks like

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,890
what are the words which are kind of

00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:14,080
kind of blacklisted I mean yeah for the

00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:16,240
entity one like we don't do any sort of

00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,130
NLP that is the question we basically we

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,610
just use like I say here or the

00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:23,140
reputation scores both things

00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:25,330
yeah like the entities are mostly this

00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:26,860
so we don't really we already take into

00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:29,380
consideration what the person is

00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:31,270
actually saying be in the only Eastern

00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:33,220
well we kind of know what when we take

00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:35,289
into consideration the content of the

00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:37,390
message is when we use the report

00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:39,309
clustering because we received the last

00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:45,250
message but other than that we haven't

00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:46,360
explored that waste so much indeed first

00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:49,779
of all you have a very cool style

00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:51,610
presenting cool thank you yeah two

00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:53,919
questions I guess the first question so

00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:55,570
you have to do give stuff in hdfs then

00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,570
you use Park and you put it into R then

00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:59,710
you put that into go yeah so it already

00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:01,090
feels like a using a bunch of languages

00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:04,210
how do you communicate this part to our

00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:07,299
bit okay good question yeah so do you

00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:08,950
spark we are or our yeah not all so we

00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:10,630
have this spark here and then after we

00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:12,429
finished our work in spark we actually

00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:15,130
we just don't we just load all the data

00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:17,110
into Impala and then in our we read from

00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:20,020
Impala and then we load all the data

00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:21,700
yeah so it's not so automated and that's

00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:23,380
mostly because of my decision because I

00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,750
cannot like to get my hands dirty in the

00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:27,580
process and select features and so on

00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,309
like kind of like to play around so if I

00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:31,360
do it automatically is going to be like

00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:34,740
pressed button and go to sleep

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:37,360
antara and nah that sucks fair enough

00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,500
one that one other question is I can

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,029
imagine one of the hard parts here is

00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,770
sort of getting the ground too right

00:21:40,029 --> 00:21:43,090
because if some people file a report

00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:44,710
these guys actually spamming that's a

00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:46,130
good signal definitely spammer and you

00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:47,450
have certainty in your label

00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:49,549
yeah it might be that someone's actually

00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,679
spamming but no one has reported it yet

00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:53,809
I mean yeah yeah like that's what sort

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,059
of your trade off there that's also I

00:21:53,809 --> 00:21:57,260
mean that does yeah that's indeed one

00:21:56,059 --> 00:21:59,950
issue like we have someone that is

00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:02,480
plumber and we do not know them but I

00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:05,510
mean yeah in some cases we just have to

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,640
close our eyes and do cogeco save this

00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:09,740
time but I mean even if the person is

00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,929
not reported on and that if the person

00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:14,630
keeps moving in the person keeps doing

00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:16,580
event eventually the first model is

00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:19,070
going to catch them because we know the

00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:22,010
activity of the users so if the person

00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:24,860
is never reported then eventually yeah

00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:26,690
eventually so we don't have time for

00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:29,000
more questions but solutions to think

00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:30,820
one after the talk yeah Swami yeah thank

00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,740
you thank you guys

00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:34,740
