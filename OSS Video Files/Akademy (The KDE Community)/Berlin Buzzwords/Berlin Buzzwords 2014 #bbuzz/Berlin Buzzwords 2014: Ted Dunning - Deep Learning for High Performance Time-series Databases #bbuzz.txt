Description: 
	Recent developments in deep learning make it possible to improve time series databases. I will show how these methods work and how to implement them using Apache Mahout.

Systems such as the Open Time Series Database (Open TSDB) make good use of the ability of HBase and related databases to store columns sparsely. This allows a single row to store many time samples and allows raw scans to retrieve a large number of samples very quickly for visualization or analysis.  Typically, older data points are batched together and compressed to save space. At high insertion rates, this approach falters largely because of the limited insert/update rate of HBase.  In such situations, it is often better to short segments of data and insert batches that span short time ranges rather than inserting individual data points.
