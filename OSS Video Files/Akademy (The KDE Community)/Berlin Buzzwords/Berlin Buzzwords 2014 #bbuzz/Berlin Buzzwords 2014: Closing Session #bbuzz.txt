okay um I I guess that's it the fifth

00:00:11,049 --> 00:00:16,450
edition it's over it's so quick I always

00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:18,700
take so long and get here and then it's

00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:21,490
so quick I i think it was great I've

00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:23,590
really enjoyed it it was probably the

00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,840
right at least from my perspective the

00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:30,730
conference that went the smoothest of

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,990
all this is this is very good I I heard

00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:36,239
a lot of people saying it was really

00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:40,989
really good but let me thank you the

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:44,230
sponsors first oh this is Swift scaling

00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:49,239
issues here different different scaling

00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:56,980
issues but sorry for those who got

00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:59,890

00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:05,649
sponsors we actually ran out of

00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:08,200
sponsoring space this year this is great

00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:12,430

00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:15,250
okay thank you for for helping us to

00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:19,560
organize this event this I think one

00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:19,560
applause at least thank you

00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:38,100

00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:45,479
resolution maybe this helps yes but this

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:51,049
Bay my toes buzz for display best for

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:51,049
display and now nothing happens awesome

00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:57,979

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,979
again

00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:14,180
didn't help a ok um this is this is

00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:16,830
actually the team that make that happen

00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:23,760
this year as the most of you have seen

00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:25,470
Isabel had a little baby and my wife had

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,990
a little baby as well and we both have

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:30,990
not that much time to help with the

00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:33,650
event but you know given that I think it

00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:36,510
was the best event out of the fifth

00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:39,750
we're gonna do that again next year just

00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:42,170
like let it go thank you thank you very

00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,170
much

00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,099
we also had a whole bunch of volunteers

00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:58,000
that helped us to be stage managers and

00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:59,650
set the event up and teardown now I

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,470
don't have pictures of you so you have

00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:06,540

00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,540

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,590

00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:31,490
there's there's one more person that I

00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:33,110
never get a picture of and that's the

00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:35,390
person behind the camera he's down there

00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:37,670
and he's done a really good job last

00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:39,410
year made me made it very possible did

00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,090
his opening sessions in closing session

00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,480
with all the pictures thank you Phillip

00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,480
thank you

00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:52,420
some of these people are here as well

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:55,540
and this is the this is the the program

00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:57,849
the program committee those people

00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:59,260
helped us to select all the talks I

00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:02,769
think we had a hundred and thirty

00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:07,480
submissions this year and it's always

00:04:02,769 --> 00:04:09,760
very hard the that process is as tough

00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,650
there's a lot of stuff to review without

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:22,000
these guys it wouldn't be possible thank

00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:24,009
you and also thank you for submitting i

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,099
think is this even more important like

00:04:24,009 --> 00:04:30,479
without the speakers you know nobody

00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:30,479
would come so thank you again

00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:42,660
and thank you for coming this is maybe

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,400
the most important thing I think this is

00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:48,520
this was by at least for me the most

00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:52,420
relaxed conference I think Isabel also

00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,890
had a really good time and I last year I

00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,270
have a lot of people saying like you

00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:57,700
know this didn't work and that didn't

00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,740
work I did like the weather I think we

00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:09,400
fixed that this year thank you again

00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:11,380
thank you sis one thing to fix for next

00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,750
year I want to see more little people so

00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:17,320
this year we had the offering of child

00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:19,240
day care Daniela got that sponsorship if

00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,220
you do have little people at home and

00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:22,690
you want to bring them to Berlin where

00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,100
you have professionals who can take care

00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,100
of them bring them
