Description: 
	Boaz Leskes talking about "Staying ahead of Users & Time - two use cases of scaling data with ElasticSearch"

People typically choose ElasticSearch for it's horizontal scaling capabilities and ease of use. Both of these come very handy when you're on a mission to index (and keep on indexing) the whole of Twitter, your endless stream of logs or offer a multi-tenant solution to any user you might take on in the future. 

We will talk about the features and design of ElasticSearch that makes it an excellent fit for these use cases. We will architect two solutions that both scales well and does it in a way that still allows for change - whether it is data changes, growth rates or resources.

The talk will be accessible to both people who know ElasticSearch (fairly) well and those who have never used it. If you know ElasticSearch and have used it before you will learn how to put some of it's more advanced data management API to good use. If you only heard of ElasticSearch (or even if not), you will get an impression of why people choose it to index ever growing amounts of data.
