Description: 
	Grant Ingersoll talking about "Level Up: Everything you need to know about search, you learned playing video games".

If you think that’s all there is to search, think again. Search is everywhere and it’s way more powerful than it used to be.  Stop building search for 10 years ago and get focused on delivering next generation insight to your users by leveraging next generation tools (NLP, machine learning, smarter data ingestion) and ideas to make your search better.

This light hearted talk, engine agnostic talk will examine common mistakes made in building search systems as well as tips and techniques for best practices in search, all in the context of the video games we all know and love.

thanks Thomas thanks everyone for coming

00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:10,139
as you said granting Psalm the CTO of

00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,150
lucid works have been a long time we've

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:15,240
seen solar committer started them out

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:18,210
machine learning project this talk is a

00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,470
very high level beginner talk I like to

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,539
say what you know people often ask me

00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,220
what is a CTO do and I usually say we do

00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:26,160
three things I call them the three C's

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,890
we write code we meet with customers and

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,869
we go with two conferences this talk is

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:32,610
derived out of that second one meeting

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:36,570
with customers and so what I want to do

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:39,629
today is shape the things I often see

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,550
both bad and good in how people are

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:43,290
implementing search based off of all of

00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,440
the years that I've been doing this all

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:49,500
the scars that I have so on but I'm

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,719
going to do it in by relating it to some

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,010
classic video games so I would encourage

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,960
you i'm going to try to have a little

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,320
fun with this if you see a video game

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,879
that you like feel free to shout it out

00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,980
afterwards if you see a video game that

00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:04,710
maybe i missed that you wanted to see

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,479
for my next talk tweeted at me or

00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,030
something along those lines let me know

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,990
why i should include your favorite video

00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:15,330
game in this if you don't recognize all

00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,610
of these games go look them up

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,220
afterwards i want to start off first

00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:23,310
with pitfalls that i often see around

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,860
search this was an early atari 2600 game

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:27,540
i think a good year of my life was

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,430
probably wasted playing this game or

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,560
something along those lines but so i

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:35,009
want to dig in a little bit and and put

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:37,560
this into context and start off with the

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:40,170
very first one which I see is a very

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,210
common pitfall amongst a lot of search

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,430
engineers and people implementing search

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,369
and I can actually share my own personal

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,590
journey here and that is as an engineer

00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:51,450
especially a server-side engineer I

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,700
think that I know how to write

00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,130
JavaScript and I think I know how to

00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:59,399
write CSS and I think therefore I know

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:02,579
how to write a UI and I've done lots of

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,189
search you eyes over the years but my UI

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:06,899
is usually look like this and in fact

00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:08,940
I'm sure if you were honest with

00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,520
yourself about the way you as a back-end

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,470
search engineer right you eyes your you

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,670
eyes probably look like this as well

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,970
and one of the key things I've learned

00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:20,100
at my time at lucidworks is in the early

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,860
days of our company we did not invest

00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:25,860
enough in UI and more importantly we did

00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:27,180
not invest enough in user experience so

00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,790
one of the things I would encourage you

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:32,730
to all go and think about is how do we

00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:35,850
invest more in not just you i but user

00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:38,940
experience what is the right way for you

00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:41,520
to show data to your users and how do

00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:44,280
you learn from how they interact with

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:50,130
that data such that you don't have this

00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:55,230
hacked up ugly looking console

00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:59,670
gaming device number two I see a lot of

00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:02,730
people who obsess over exact results in

00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:04,830
their search pages and that can be good

00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:07,170
to a certain extent until you start to

00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:09,360
find yourself going crazy and in

00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:11,640
particular I see a lot of people who

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,100
treat anything that's not the very first

00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,410
result as being you know that second

00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,790
that that first loser right and so I

00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,920
would encourage you to think about

00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,870
relevance and we'll talk about relevance

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,030
a bit more as we go and we get into some

00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,459
of the best practices side of the

00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,320
equation here but one of the things I

00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:30,150
like to tell people just upfront is

00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,950
anything that's above the fold you

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:34,200
should consider as being pretty good and

00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,690
then you can tweak from there but don't

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,239
lose all your hair over you know is

00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,830
number two why isn't that number one I

00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:42,510
can't tell you the number of customers

00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,739
i've been at where their bosses come

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,380
into them and say could you make that

00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,450
one number one and then they go spend

00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:50,910
six weeks making it number one and then

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,830
they broke all of their other queries

00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:55,019
and so we'll talk a little bit about how

00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,970
you solve for that problem as an

00:03:55,019 --> 00:04:00,720
engineer dealing with people who don't

00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:03,090
get how all of this fuzzy statistical

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:09,230
probabilistic vector space matching

00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:12,000
works anyone familiar with this game

00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:14,940
some people credit this game as being

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,450
the game that ruined the Atari 2600 that

00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:20,940
actually caused it to stop being sold

00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:24,510
and in fact I think a few years ago this

00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:26,220
is ET the extra-terrestrial game I think

00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,379
a few years ago if you go google it on

00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:31,560
wikipedia

00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:33,870
they found like 50,000 copies of this in

00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:37,590
some landfill in Arizona in the United

00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:40,860
States if you've ever played it it is an

00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:42,599
awful user experience so I would

00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,569
encourage you to go find an emulator and

00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:48,599
try it yourself the point of this game

00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:52,349
though is often that ET which is that

00:04:48,599 --> 00:04:55,590
really nice 8 bit pixelated green blobby

00:04:52,349 --> 00:05:00,389
thing up there he often or she whatever

00:04:55,590 --> 00:05:02,699
et is often falls into a pit and then et

00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:04,800
can't get out and the there were so many

00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:06,990
bugs in this game that the game would

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,300
glitch out at this point or you get

00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:12,030
killed by whatever that thing is there

00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:15,509
it's a snake the point being in search

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:18,000
you often i often find customers get

00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:20,539
stuck in a pit when it comes to thinking

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,949
about relevance they've got these

00:05:20,539 --> 00:05:24,509
they've got their bosses and things like

00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:26,789
that telling them this is how search

00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:29,759
should be they think about search and

00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:31,020
only one way and so then they end up in

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,110
this pit and then they wonder why

00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:36,360
they're not able to monetize the results

00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:38,729
properly or get feedback back to their

00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,340
customers appropriately and so I would

00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:43,710
encourage you to think about where are

00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,539
you are you stuck in that pit how could

00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:47,219
you leap frog out of that and the rest

00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:50,219
of the talk here we'll we'll get to some

00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:52,830
of these things as well one of the

00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:55,669
common pits that I find people in our

00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:58,080
what i like to call pet peeve queries

00:05:55,669 --> 00:05:59,550
this is i don't know if people are

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,810
familiar with this english saying but a

00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,089
pet peeve query this is like your

00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:04,919
personal favorite query this is the

00:06:03,089 --> 00:06:07,529
system I guarantee if you've ever

00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:10,080
developed a Search application you have

00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:13,560
like one or two queries that you run all

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,240
the time my very first search engine I

00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:19,289
was building a cross language search

00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:22,319
engine between English and Japanese how

00:06:19,289 --> 00:06:25,409
many people speak Japanese here anyone

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,199
nope I don't speak Japanese either guess

00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:31,610
what my query was it was literally the

00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:34,080
word Japan the two characters that the

00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:36,569
Japanese speaker that I was working with

00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,680
on the system taught me those two

00:06:36,569 --> 00:06:42,110
characters and that was the query I used

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,050
every time I tested whether that system

00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:47,930
was working until we actually had live

00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:50,449
real data right the other kinds of pet

00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:54,440
peeve queries are often CR are actually

00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:56,060
the boss's pet peeve queries sure I see

00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,570
some people nodding their heads the boss

00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:02,690
comes in hey Joe hey Jane search is

00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:07,669
broken I did a search for fill in the

00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:09,979
blank and the results are terrible fix

00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:11,780
it and then now you go off and again

00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:14,449
you're in that local minimum you're

00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:16,400
stuck tuning those queries I see a lot

00:07:14,449 --> 00:07:18,410
of people nodding here yes we'll talk

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,070
how to get out of pet peeve queries here

00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:26,810
in a minute next up I see a lot of

00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:28,930
people just getting lucky how many

00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:31,160
people are familiar with super meat boy

00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:34,580
we got a few fans we're getting a little

00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,710
bit more modern here by my son's account

00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,990
and I think many other people on the

00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:41,560
internet super meat boy is probably the

00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:44,090
single hardest video game ever made I

00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:47,360
don't know if you agree or disagree with

00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:50,870
that but when I play super meat boy with

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:54,620
my son I sometimes get through a level

00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:59,030
and usually when I think about it it's

00:07:54,620 --> 00:08:01,699
because I'm lucky right the thing that I

00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:03,860
often see in the search world that

00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:06,289
relates to super meat boy is also kind

00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:08,539
of similar to what is sometimes called

00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:11,479
as the Oprah effect if you're familiar

00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:15,470
with Oprah Winfrey it's that this case

00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:17,990
where as a developer or as a business we

00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:19,639
have these great ideas these are awesome

00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:21,500
these are going to make the company

00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:23,449
another million dollars a day or

00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:29,150
whatever it is and we go and deploy them

00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:31,750
and voila they worked but what we didn't

00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:35,719
realize and what we didn't test for is

00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:38,300
are we just getting lucky right so the

00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,760
story around the Oprah fact is that one

00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:43,279
day this company redesigned their

00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:46,520
website they went live they launched etc

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:49,010
and it just and traffic went through the

00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,630
roof on their new site and they were

00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:52,400
sitting there congratulating themselves

00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,350
on how smart they were

00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,300
and then somebody came in the next day

00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:59,980
and said oh did you watch Oprah last

00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:02,960
night or yesterday we were on it and

00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:04,820
Oprah was the reason why everybody was

00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:07,100
coming to their website and why it was

00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,530
performing so high and so these are

00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:12,500
things where you start to employ a be

00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:14,600
testing and a a testing and other kinds

00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:17,090
of analysis to make sure that the

00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:20,060
changes you're making aren't just about

00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:22,520
you getting lucky because let's face it

00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:24,470
rare events happen right so make sure

00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,740
you're doing the math to understand

00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:29,570
whether you're just getting lucky or

00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:31,160
this stuff is really working and there's

00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:33,170
a lot of good tools out there and a lot

00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:39,470
of good information on these kinds of

00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:42,680
things next one any portal fans all

00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:44,540
right now we're to see you know got

00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:46,430
retro games now we got the newer ones

00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:50,720
one of the things I like to think about

00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:53,420
with search is in Portal if you don't

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:55,760
know you can basically jump between you

00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,990
know across time and dimension all that

00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,510
kind of stuff right you have this little

00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:01,520
gun and it opens up these portals to

00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:04,910
other dimensions one of the things that

00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:08,360
I often see developers make is they make

00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:11,030
assumptions that their system can't do

00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,830
something right oh it's a search engine

00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:15,920
well I would never use that as a key

00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:17,840
value store or it's a search engine

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,200
what's that got to do with collaborative

00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:23,120
filtering style recommendations why

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,970
would I do recommendations in a search

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,400
engine or hey I can't store my time

00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:30,410
series data in something like we've seen

00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:33,560
that's just crazy I need to go have a

00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:35,530
time series database and so I would

00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,050
challenge you to think about what

00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:41,180
assumptions do you have in your

00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:43,550
application and then think about what is

00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,410
the best way to solve those we see time

00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:47,930
and time again for instance so one of

00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:51,260
the old ones in lucene was who scenes

00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:53,240
not fast enough for doing that or why do

00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:56,330
I have to send in and redo the whole

00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:58,610
query every time I do a search can't I

00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:01,130
just be smarter in cash and do something

00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:02,510
about those kinds of things but the

00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:04,460
people who would ask those questions

00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:06,019
never actually tested whether it was

00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:10,040
fast enough or not or not

00:11:06,019 --> 00:11:11,660
they just assumed it was so I would

00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,759
encourage you to leave you with that I

00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:17,480
would also encourage you to think about

00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:18,949
things like whether just because a user

00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,800
and one of the other assumptions I see

00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:24,889
is just because a user types in one set

00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:27,049
of queries that that's the only query

00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:29,899
that you should run against your system

00:11:27,049 --> 00:11:32,899
or that you should even run a query at

00:11:29,899 --> 00:11:36,079
all if you think about it the user is

00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:39,920
really after an information need they

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:42,230
want an answer some queries they just

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,420
need that exact answer and so if you

00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:46,339
know that answer ahead of time if

00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,079
somebody comes on your site and the

00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:49,699
first thing they do is search for Super

00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,920
Meat Boy then just give them straight up

00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:53,809
super meat boy you don't need to go do

00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,939
anything else you probably don't even

00:11:53,809 --> 00:11:57,709
need to hit your search engine the other

00:11:55,939 --> 00:12:00,619
thing side of this is the invisible

00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:03,230
queries is the notion that just because

00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:06,110
a user does one query doesn't mean you

00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:07,549
have to only do one query right I once

00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:10,160
worked with a company this is in the

00:12:07,549 --> 00:12:12,980
travel space where for any given user

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:16,220
query they would often have as many as

00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:18,589
14 different queries depending on how

00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:20,660
well you know kind of a back-off

00:12:18,589 --> 00:12:25,429
strategy depending on how well things

00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:28,730
worked as they went down the chain so

00:12:25,429 --> 00:12:30,559
that's some of the common pitfalls I

00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:32,360
played a lot of Mario Brothers Super

00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,309
Mario Brothers I just have this one up

00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,860
here as a segue to talk about best

00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:40,309
practices I not me that I have any

00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:42,410
specific rules or thoughts on Mario

00:12:40,309 --> 00:12:46,759
other than it was my favorite game in

00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:52,869
college not to date myself there so some

00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:54,919
best practices anybody remember 0 wing

00:12:52,869 --> 00:12:57,470
nobody remembers this game other than

00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:59,569
everybody remembers them saying all your

00:12:57,470 --> 00:13:04,220
bases are belong to us it was a classic

00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:06,019
case of bad translation the interesting

00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,299
thing when I think about all your data

00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:10,429
are belong to us is a lot of times when

00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:12,499
i go into customers especially in

00:13:10,429 --> 00:13:14,959
talking to the engineers there's this

00:13:12,499 --> 00:13:17,329
obsession with making sure that you're

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,400
using every last latest and greatest

00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:21,530
thing that does everything

00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,510
and then building the super complex

00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:25,970
architecture where you've got like five

00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:29,360
different distributed systems all trying

00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:30,680
to keep in sync and I see them up front

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,810
and they say oh we're going to do this

00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:35,870
big fancy architecture and sometimes

00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:37,520
that's needed by all means but a lot of

00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:39,140
times after talking to them I'm just

00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,700
like you know you can do a lot of this

00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:42,200
straight out of your search engine if

00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,850
you haven't looked at something like

00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,550
some of these leucine based search

00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:48,620
engines recently especially solar for

00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:50,480
instance yesterday we talked about the

00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:52,340
streaming aggregations the sequel

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,810
interfaces all of those kinds of things

00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:59,990
you can often put all of your stuff in a

00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:02,750
search engine like solar right you can

00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:06,680
take you can do graph operations you can

00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:08,480
do streaming opera or you can do some of

00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:10,400
these streaming operations where your

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,980
join you're doing joins and all of that

00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,840
kind of stuff because at the end of the

00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:17,510
day you know if you think about your use

00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:19,940
cases what I usually tell people is if

00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:22,280
my first use case is search and then my

00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:25,040
secondary use cases you know it's kind

00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,840
of batch or analytical operations search

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,000
engine can win that one hands down you

00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:32,150
don't need two different systems in sync

00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:35,180
there if your primary use cases is more

00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:37,280
large-scale analytics I used to say go

00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:39,680
do that's where you do need two systems

00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:42,020
now these days with you know a lot of

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,360
the analytical systems being built into

00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:46,880
leucine is its derivatives you can

00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,880
actually do all of this in the engine as

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:52,220
well so I would encourage you to think

00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:54,830
about how can you simplify your

00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:56,570
operations as engineers you often don't

00:14:54,830 --> 00:15:00,410
think about the pain that you put on

00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:02,060
your DevOps people but trust me when if

00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:04,700
you think about it one distributed

00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:07,850
system is hard to distributed systems in

00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:10,250
sync is significantly harder right so

00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:12,830
try to reduce that load try to simplify

00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,660
you can't always do it but I would

00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:17,330
encourage you to go back and think about

00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:19,430
it and you might be surprised at one is

00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:21,680
what some of these more modern data

00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:24,380
stores that have searched as the first

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,350
application do so for instance we have

00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:29,210
customers who use solar as a key value

00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:31,610
store and they're doing upwards a 100

00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:34,550
200 thousand writes per second

00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:37,910
and reads per second we've got customers

00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:40,220
who do are doing millions of writes per

00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:45,740
second these are all possible in modern

00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:49,660
search engine architectures probably my

00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:52,700
second favorite game after Super Mario

00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:55,610
although I'm primary a classic Legend of

00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:58,490
Zelda Zelda a player and not so much the

00:15:55,610 --> 00:16:00,740
modern ones here but another thing that

00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:03,649
I think a lot of people in search

00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:08,360
applications don't think about is how to

00:16:03,649 --> 00:16:10,220
use time based data right they don't

00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,110
think about the fact that newer

00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,790
information is better than older

00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:15,610
information or maybe some people do

00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:19,640
that's kind of the easy one is to boost

00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:22,399
by boost by recency that one's been

00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:25,220
along around a long time but for

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,680
instance they don't take account of how

00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:30,230
people are interacting with the data

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,200
what people are doing right now versus

00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:35,420
last week versus last year they're not

00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,980
thinking about how to leverage all of

00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,260
this stuff things like session

00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:43,670
information a lot of people treat

00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:45,680
queries just as one single event and the

00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:48,709
next event has nothing to do with it but

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:51,110
if you actually look at good academic

00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:52,730
research around session ization and all

00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,850
of those kinds of things and if you look

00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:58,970
at how people rewrite their queries over

00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:01,370
time you can take advantage of that kind

00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:06,439
of time information as well to provide

00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:09,049
better relevance for your users kind of

00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:11,809
a we'll do a little Einstein mashing

00:17:09,049 --> 00:17:14,540
here time ends space the other side of

00:17:11,809 --> 00:17:18,049
this is how people are using space now a

00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:21,770
lot of people who do local search space

00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:23,660
obviously is a very key part of that if

00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:25,429
you're not familiar this is maybe a too

00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:27,850
much of American reference it's called

00:17:25,429 --> 00:17:29,990
where in the world is Carmen Sandiego

00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:32,960
this is one of those games that your

00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:36,410
teacher made you play because it taught

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:39,080
you geography but there's a lot of

00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:40,340
interesting spatial data out there as

00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,050
well whether that's just something

00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:44,630
you're getting from IP addresses and

00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:46,550
doing reverse dns lookups or

00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:48,530
or whether you're taking advantage of

00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:50,480
time zone information or you're taking

00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:52,640
it advantage of the fact that a user

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,620
happens to live in the north and it's

00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,260
winter and so when they search for

00:17:54,620 --> 00:18:00,080
shovels chances are they mean snow

00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:02,870
shovels and not you know gardening

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,560
shovels so taking advantage of all of

00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:08,390
those kinds of things thinking about how

00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:11,210
spatial data can be leveraged in your

00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:13,490
system the spatial stuff is all very

00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:16,040
tightly integrated in with we've seen

00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:18,970
and solar and related engines so you can

00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:22,130
go and apply a lot of really interesting

00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:25,850
spatial operations on top of your data

00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:28,070
the other thing I'll say on this is that

00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:30,680
notice that I'm using the word spatial

00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:33,170
and not geospatial this isn't

00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:35,690
necessarily just about latitude and

00:18:33,170 --> 00:18:37,460
longitude the spatial capabilities that

00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:39,950
come in lucene can actually do some

00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:42,170
really interesting things when you think

00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:44,930
about how do I map this out into an

00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:47,510
n-dimensional space so there's a lot of

00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:51,020
other good talks on that if you if you

00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:54,080
just google things like using spatial

00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:56,870
solar spatial for non spatial problems

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,000
you should find some good talks on that

00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:02,630
kind of stuff for instance you can

00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:05,270
leverage this to model when an office or

00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:07,310
a restaurant is open or closed that was

00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:09,170
really hard to do in other ways but it's

00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:21,440
really simple using the spatial

00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:23,060
capabilities any Sims fans out there a

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,220
good friend of mine who's based here in

00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:29,630
Berlin actually worked on the very first

00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:31,580
SimCity project so this one's a fun one

00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:34,160
to talk about to I think you know this

00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:37,670
is kind of goes along with this notion

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:41,300
that we as developers often only think

00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:44,870
about queries as individual queries and

00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:47,540
they're all kind of isolated and we very

00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:51,230
often forget about users I think as

00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:53,270
developers you know it's like users why

00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:55,880
do I have to bother them or why do they

00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:57,960
have to bother me right isn't that

00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:59,640
something that the marketing team

00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:03,720
be worrying about or the finance team

00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:06,120
etc I see a lot of Engineers where they

00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:10,130
just do not spend any amount of time

00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:13,260
trying to understand the users at all

00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:15,600
the interesting thing is if you look at

00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:18,210
the evolution of search over the past 5

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:22,409
10 years if you look at like what Google

00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:24,630
and the the big providers do it's all

00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:27,480
about modeling the users you know the

00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:30,480
the intent or the the user intent side

00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:33,330
of things knowing that for instance when

00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:36,750
a user asks when does the shuttle leave

00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:38,640
for the airport in there at a hotel it

00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:40,830
doesn't mean they want 10 blue links

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,330
with 10 different shuttles they want to

00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,700
know the answer to when does this

00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:46,500
shuttle that I'm at for this hotel leave

00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,750
to the airport and so they want an

00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:52,260
answer back that says you know 5 p.m. or

00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:53,899
whatever it is and so this is all about

00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:56,820
if you were at the learning to rank

00:20:53,899 --> 00:20:59,340
session earlier by Andrew Craig this is

00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:01,830
all about trying to learn and understand

00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:03,799
what users are doing by looking at all

00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:06,960
of the features that you can capture

00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:08,970
about your users and then feeding them

00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,649
back in and I think actually one of the

00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:12,299
interesting things that we've been doing

00:21:10,649 --> 00:21:15,210
is we actually put all of this user

00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:17,460
behavior data right back into solar and

00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:19,320
that does two things for us one it

00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,110
allows us to search against all of our

00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,760
user data which has this incredible

00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:26,279
democratization effect on an

00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:29,309
organization because it's too often the

00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:32,460
case that user data is all locked up in

00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:34,140
Omniture and only marketing gets to see

00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:36,360
it and the engineers only get to see

00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:40,350
thee they only get to see it when it's

00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:42,330
not performing very well or it's locked

00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:45,029
up in IT and the only people who ever

00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:47,370
get to see it are those who know sequel

00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:49,500
and who can write queries against it

00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:53,700
maybe you get a visualization or a

00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:56,190
report on this data but chances are you

00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,260
don't all right and so by capturing all

00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:01,320
this stuff into your search engine you

00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:03,120
can then give a search interface to it

00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,940
and then now everybody in the

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:08,190
organization can know what matters to

00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:10,500
users and I think that's a really

00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:11,800
important first step for companies to

00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,200
try to account

00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,970
for it and then of course once you get

00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,220
beyond that now you can start to process

00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:21,610
it you can build recommendation engines

00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:23,830
you can do statistical models around and

00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:25,900
you know trying to predict how users are

00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:31,350
going to behave per query per session

00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:31,350
per rewrite all of those kinds of things

00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:38,380
next up this is I think the really old

00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:43,300
metal metal gear solid which is one of

00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:44,830
the first kind of sniper or spy type

00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:47,170
games where the whole point of the game

00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:49,360
was to not get detected so in some sense

00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:51,850
this slide is about the opposite of that

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:56,340
of how do you detect when something's

00:22:51,850 --> 00:23:00,160
wrong I think you know the the the

00:22:56,340 --> 00:23:02,830
search world has kind of forgotten a lot

00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,840
of the early work around alerting it

00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:07,390
used to be called document routing back

00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:10,090
in like the 80s or document filtering

00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:13,570
etc one of the nice things going to come

00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:16,480
out of some of the recent log based

00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:19,180
search capabilities like splunk etc is

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,330
that you know alerting on a search

00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:24,490
engine is now in vogue again I like to

00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:26,260
think and take about it take it another

00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:28,360
level it's not just about alerting on

00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:32,080
logs or alerting on specific documents

00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:35,320
it's this notion that as we get more and

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,840
more data you want to be more proactive

00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:39,760
with your users about how they're

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,280
interacting with you and again so if you

00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:45,130
start to weave together time and space

00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:47,410
and and and data flowing in in a

00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:50,230
streaming way you start to get a better

00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:53,410
picture of wind should I send something

00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:55,720
to a user and wind should I not and you

00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:58,240
can craft much more interesting queries

00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:03,000
that can then run constantly an alert

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:05,710
customers alert users anytime they want

00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,980
one of the other interesting trends in

00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:12,430
the search space I think is actually a

00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:14,950
broader data platform trend in that if

00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:16,390
you go in and we abstract ourself and

00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:18,790
think about what all of these different

00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:20,650
projects are trying to do and what all

00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:23,200
the different vendors are trying to do

00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:23,840
is everybody wants to own all of your

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,390
data ever

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,250
vendor wants all of your data guilty as

00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:31,039
charged i want all your data in my

00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:34,760
product anybody who doesn't agree to

00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,990
that probably is lying right and so one

00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:38,539
of the things that's been really

00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:40,940
interesting is all of these other data

00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:43,460
platforms databases etc they've been

00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:46,010
adding search capabilities some do

00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:47,720
better job than others well the search

00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:51,260
people haven't been sitting on their

00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:53,659
hands either they've been adding a lot

00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:56,659
of database like qualities such that

00:24:53,659 --> 00:25:00,620
nowadays you can do joins you can do

00:24:56,659 --> 00:25:02,659
grouping you can do have an and all

00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:04,940
kinds of traditional database operations

00:25:02,659 --> 00:25:07,520
in fact if you were at Shaolin my

00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:10,220
colleagues talked yesterday solar itself

00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,590
has a full sequel front end to it so all

00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:15,350
those people that know sequel you can go

00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:18,950
use sequel and yes I get the irony of

00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:21,080
saying no sequel when I mean KN 0 w the

00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:24,320
other thing that I think added at a more

00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:26,750
interesting level is to take this notion

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,970
around puzzles up a level so it's one

00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:31,700
thing to join at documents individual

00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:33,950
documents it's another thing to start to

00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:37,309
think about how can a search engine be

00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:39,950
used to piece together a puzzle over

00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:42,020
time I wish I had thought of this

00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:44,390
there's a gentleman by the name of Jeff

00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:47,210
Jonas who works at IBM and he has a

00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:50,390
really great talk on thinking about the

00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:53,630
data puzzle and how as data flows in you

00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:56,029
get a much more complete picture of what

00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:58,070
users are doing and what matters and

00:25:56,029 --> 00:26:01,010
what the data actually means so for

00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:03,710
instance you might have just a user name

00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:05,510
first and then later on you might get a

00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:07,940
user name and an address and then

00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:10,490
another that same username and another

00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:12,620
address and and so on and so forth and

00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:15,200
as you think about all that data flowing

00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:18,590
together you have all of these problems

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:21,020
around which data do I trust which data

00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:22,640
actually matters what data can I reason

00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:24,950
about and so this is where things like

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,899
graph stores and stuff like that can

00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:28,549
help but at the end of the day you can

00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:31,279
sometimes think about leveraging a

00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:33,590
search engine to build out this linkage

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:36,230
and in fact this whole space is called

00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:37,250
record linkage and a search engine it

00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:40,400
can be really

00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:42,920
helpful in solving that problem it's not

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:45,740
the solution for that problem but it is

00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:47,840
often a pretty interesting part of that

00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:49,700
problem especially when you start to

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,740
think about doing things like fuzzy

00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:56,420
string matching and all of those kinds

00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:59,180
of things how many people have voice

00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:03,350
interfaces on their search application

00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:05,060
now nobody well you know I don't know

00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:08,270
last time you talked to your phone but

00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:10,880
you better get one maybe in the next

00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:12,110
year maybe in the next two years this is

00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,420
something i think that's coming

00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:17,210
obviously a lot more open source is

00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:18,620
frankly way behind here so if you want

00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:22,010
to go start up if you know anything

00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:23,510
about speech recognition please go start

00:27:22,010 --> 00:27:24,740
an open source project there are a

00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:26,600
couple out there but they're pretty

00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:28,490
cumbersome and hard to train and all of

00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:31,100
that kind of stuff I won't spend too

00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:32,240
much time on voice other than to fit you

00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,580
one of the things you need to think

00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:38,180
about with voice is that you are more

00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:40,640
likely to get real natural language from

00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:43,400
your user right and so that brings a

00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,860
whole host of other problems for you as

00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:48,500
an engineer right because now you've got

00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:50,780
to figure out what actually matters in

00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:53,210
the query beyond just the keywords

00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:54,980
you've got a parse however many

00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:57,980
different languages you have to deal

00:27:54,980 --> 00:28:00,170
with the fact that voice to text is not

00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:02,510
a perfect science and that you're going

00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:04,400
to have a lot of garbage in your queries

00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:07,370
and so how do you deal what strategies

00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:10,730
do you have for doing with bad user

00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:14,960
input similar things to like people

00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:16,520
can't spell so on so forth so if you're

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,970
not thinking about voice if you are

00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:21,020
especially a consumer-facing application

00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:22,610
this is something that would encourage

00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:24,530
you to look at we're actually starting

00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:27,590
to see this with some of our clients

00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:29,540
behind the firewall as well in the

00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:32,780
enterprise especially in places like

00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:36,260
call centres where they want to have

00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:39,380
their account managers be able to just

00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:42,290
talk to the engine and get back results

00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:44,510
so lots of interesting things going on

00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:47,000
in this space especially the deep

00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:48,620
learning work has been really showing

00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:51,220
some really interesting capabilities

00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:51,220
around voice

00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:57,809
there are some decent voice based api's

00:28:54,990 --> 00:29:03,419
that you can just call out to but they

00:28:57,809 --> 00:29:06,630
then they still need a lot of work last

00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:09,240
but not least on the thinking about best

00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:10,620
practices this is one that's really near

00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,980
and dear to my heart and I see a lot of

00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:16,340
people struggle with relevance and I see

00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:20,280
a lot of engineers who kind of blow off

00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:22,289
relevance because let's face it it's a

00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,970
hard problem it's a squishy problem

00:29:22,289 --> 00:29:26,309
right I mean we've got all this

00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:28,919
fuzziness going on and especially for

00:29:26,309 --> 00:29:31,620
most engineers who were trained in

00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:34,919
databases and doing relational logic

00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:37,169
this notion of squishiness or fuzziness

00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:40,350
is not something that we're used to

00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:42,659
write and so what do you mean this

00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:44,909
result that was number one today is not

00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:46,620
number one tomorrow like I like that's

00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:50,010
just fundamentally a hard but I did the

00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:52,110
exact same query right and so we often

00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:54,539
then fall back to what we are good at

00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:57,090
and I see a lot of engineers I walk in

00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:58,559
the door and they're like we do 10,000

00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,940
queries per second and they're really

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,860
proud of that and they should be because

00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:04,140
you know that's that's a good scaling

00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,730
system right but then I often ask them

00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:08,669
the question well what if you only had

00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:09,990
to do 8,000 queries per second what

00:30:08,669 --> 00:30:12,450
would that change could you cut your

00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:14,669
hardware by ten percent how much would

00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:17,220
your business love you if you save ten

00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:19,770
percent on your hardware well what if

00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:22,049
some of that savings actually came from

00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:24,299
the fact that you had better relevance

00:30:22,049 --> 00:30:27,450
what if you realized after you look at

00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:29,760
all of your logs that users are typing

00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:33,960
and trying to fix the fact that your

00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:36,030
relevance sucks right what if that were

00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,919
the case what if when they came in and

00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:39,450
they found they typed in their query and

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,919
they found it right there and then they

00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:43,140
went and bought it how much happier

00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:44,970
would your business team be as opposed

00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:47,010
to they had to do rewrites you had to do

00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:50,429
all of these other things to try to get

00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:52,530
them onto the right set of results and

00:30:50,429 --> 00:30:54,450
so if you're not familiar this is the

00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:56,520
original Legend of Zelda and this is

00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:58,830
part called the Lost Woods and if you

00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:01,470
didn't do a particular pattern you could

00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:02,990
not get out of the Lost Woods and so one

00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:05,720
of the things I try to encourage

00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:08,150
to do is right from the get-go as an

00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,670
engineer not as the business person etc

00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:13,610
think about what your relevant

00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:15,679
strategies are going to be think about

00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:17,809
how you're going to capture a user or

00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:21,080
feedback think about all of the things

00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:23,630
that go into relevance or at least be

00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:25,880
prepared for those kinds of things by

00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:27,620
capturing the information up front you

00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:30,230
may not know how to use all of your

00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:32,360
clickstream data right when you get

00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:34,220
going but if you don't capture it you

00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:37,640
certainly aren't going to be able to do

00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:39,380
anything with it I also encourage you

00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:41,809
this goes back to that democratization

00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:43,700
of the data make sure that you're

00:31:41,809 --> 00:31:46,070
ingrained with your business people

00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:48,410
about getting information about what

00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:50,720
your customers care about because then

00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:52,880
when your boss comes in with that pet

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,340
peeve query and says hey you know query

00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,140
X doesn't work you can say okay boss

00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:59,620
which would you like me to work on your

00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:03,110
query which no one ever does but you or

00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:06,590
these top 20 which make ninety percent

00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:08,270
of our business our money right all of a

00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:11,000
sudden your boss says wow you're really

00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:13,670
smart and lets you go do your job as

00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,850
opposed to bothering you incessantly

00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:19,940
about that so I would encourage you all

00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:21,500
to stop and ask directions if you don't

00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:23,330
know and Zelda there was a little cave

00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:27,350
way off on the other side of the map

00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:31,640
where the woman in the cave told you how

00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:34,780
to get out of the Lost Woods at the end

00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:38,540
of the day what you really need is a

00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:40,850
plan to think about how to leverage all

00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:42,800
of these kinds of things right I see a

00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:44,210
lot of customers who come in and they're

00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:49,160
just like oh well leucine and solar

00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:50,510
that's my search checkbox and 5-10 years

00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:56,120
ago when you know we started this

00:32:50,510 --> 00:33:01,090
company in 2007 so about nine years ago

00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:04,520
almost back then keywords 10 blue links

00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:07,460
game over sign the check we're all happy

00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:09,559
and then Google Cain you know Google

00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:13,580
updates game Amazon updates game

00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:16,160
facebook updates game and you now

00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:18,620
realize that this core matching

00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:20,360
that something like leucine does this

00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:22,940
core you know like steak something like

00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:25,550
BM 25 or the vector space model or any

00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:27,800
of these core ranking algorithms I've

00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:29,720
seen some people say that only gets you

00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,280
about fifty percent of the way when it

00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,190
comes to relevance especially in

00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:37,700
consumer facing applications I was one

00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:40,940
sitting next to a the CTO of a very

00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:42,770
large public search engine and he said

00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:45,290
he made the claim out loud in front of a

00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:47,690
bunch of academics that BM 25 in his

00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:51,290
situation only got him fifty two percent

00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:52,970
of the way if you think about that if

00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:55,490
you're ever on the academic side of

00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:58,280
things you know BM 25 is held up is the

00:33:55,490 --> 00:34:00,950
gold standard for search relevance this

00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:02,720
guy was a heretic saying it only gets

00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:04,190
you just better than a little bit better

00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,280
than guessing or a little bit better

00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:10,190
than fifty two percent so all of these

00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:12,740
other things by planning around them and

00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:15,230
incorporating them into your application

00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:18,470
thinking about them from day one that's

00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:20,030
the rest of the way right user signals

00:34:18,470 --> 00:34:21,590
what are people clicking on what are

00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:23,540
they sharing what are they treating what

00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:25,340
are they buying all of those kinds of

00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:27,500
things time and space what was

00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:29,929
interesting today is not necessarily

00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:32,240
going to be interesting tomorrow have a

00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:34,610
plan for how you're going to bring these

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,740
in accordingly choose an engine that

00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:39,950
allows you to do these kinds of things

00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:44,390
make sure that the data that defines

00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:46,070
success in this isn't way off separate

00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:48,500
because I guarantee you if that data

00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:50,870
that is going to help you get all this

00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:53,450
feedback is often some system that's

00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:55,550
really hard to get to or locked up in a

00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:59,600
third party like an armature or google

00:34:55,550 --> 00:35:02,330
analytics you're not going to have it

00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:05,870
when you need it and so bring it in to

00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:08,240
your application and make better use of

00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:09,860
it the next thing I would encourage you

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,590
again and go if you didn't see Andrew

00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:14,180
Clegg's talk and learning to rank at the

00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:15,650
end of the day you always have to be

00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:17,810
learning on this stuff I would encourage

00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:19,880
you to start to think about how do you

00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:22,190
incorporate machine learning into your

00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:24,160
core ranking functions this is a great

00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:26,900
way to grab all of those features

00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:29,780
including the content that clicks the

00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:33,230
events and learn from it and

00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:35,630
make for a better application so it's

00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:37,190
like I said it's squishy at times it's

00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:39,590
hard to wrap your head around the math

00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:42,140
but there's a lot of good libraries out

00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:44,000
there there's if you're a solar user

00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:45,950
there's a patch that I think is pretty

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,630
close to being committed that actually

00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:49,910
makes learning to rank and solar a

00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:52,850
native operation you still have to train

00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:54,740
your models offline but you can plug

00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:58,370
those kinds of things in works and

00:35:54,740 --> 00:36:00,790
distributed at scale and so make sure

00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:03,200
your system and application is learning

00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:04,970
it goes without saying that as an

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,310
engineer this is something you should

00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:09,350
apply to your own life as well get out

00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:11,810
of that trap of your assumptions and

00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:13,490
make sure that you are learning the

00:36:11,810 --> 00:36:17,180
latest and greatest as well and how to

00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:19,340
incorporate that I don't have anything

00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:22,990
about Phoenix Wright my son really likes

00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:25,370
the song games so it's an attorney game

00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:27,320
so I'd encourage you to check that one

00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:29,540
out and then I just want to leave you

00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:32,060
with I what I think is one of the really

00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:35,030
interesting things to think about in

00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:38,210
this space and if you if you don't play

00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:41,570
a lot of games this is skyrim the elder

00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:43,730
scrolls five and one of the interesting

00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:45,200
things about this game is it's a total

00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:48,050
free play game there's lots of these

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:50,030
free play games out there right the

00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:52,550
interesting thing that I think about is

00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:54,710
it's a great time to be a developer and

00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:57,910
it's a great time to be in the search

00:36:54,710 --> 00:37:01,700
development space you got a ton of data

00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:04,340
you got a ton of computing and you've

00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:06,770
got a ton of users and so I would

00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:08,930
encourage you again to start exploring

00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:11,540
some of these ideas think about ways

00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:14,240
that you can incorporate more of this

00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:16,940
into your application basically start

00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:20,240
treating this as a free play space where

00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:23,530
you can say how do I drive down the cost

00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:28,070
of experimentation in my application

00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:31,670
such that my business can then fail and

00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:33,500
fail very fast and then learn from those

00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:35,900
failures and get better and better and

00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:38,090
better some people say if you look at

00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:39,560
companies like Google and Facebook and

00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:41,900
all that and you look at their search

00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:43,720
results I don't know the exact numbers

00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:46,480
but I've seen estimates that only about

00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:49,660
ten percent of all users on internet

00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:52,960
search ever see what that company

00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:56,650
considers to be the best version of

00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:58,510
their search engine think about that I

00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:00,820
guarantee you almost everyone in the

00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:03,640
room here you have one version of your

00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:05,680
search engine maybe two every now and

00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:09,040
then you tweak your search formula or

00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:11,800
you lowercase your fields or whatever

00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:14,560
and then maybe you do a/b testing on

00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:16,480
that a lot of you people don't I've seen

00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,980
a lot of e-commerce companies that don't

00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,260
for instance and that's like Court of

00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:21,880
their business but if you start to think

00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:25,000
about if you can drive down that

00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:27,670
experimentation cost now you have a lot

00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,260
more room to play because you get to be

00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:31,359
wrong and that's a really powerful thing

00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:33,099
as an engineer's did the ability to be

00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:35,140
wrong because everybody looks at you to

00:38:33,099 --> 00:38:36,640
be right and instead you can say oh I

00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:38,260
was wrong on that one but guess what

00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,270
I've got the system in place that shows

00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:42,460
me I'm wrong therefore I'm actually

00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:46,450
right because the next time around the

00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:49,000
next experiment is going to be right so

00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:52,210
with that I think we got time for maybe

00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:54,130
one or two questions miss pac-man that's

00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:56,830
my all-time favorite right up there with

00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:59,040
Super Mario Brothers so a lot of

00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:02,410
quarters spent on that game as well

00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:04,560
thanks meant thanks Quinn always thank

00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:04,560
you

00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:10,810
oh and by the way if you want a more

00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:12,130
hands-on lower level coding i'm doing a

00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:14,230
workshop at four-thirty and we'll

00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:17,320
explore a lot of these ideas using solar

00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:26,620
and spark so all the questions or

00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:29,140
comments any questions all right right

00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:31,000
it's hot in here Oh God was right there

00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:32,620
okay I like gonna get him with something

00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,050
grant kind of thank you for the coffee

00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:37,530
I've been drinking it for us to day we

00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:40,210
will appreciate that thank you yeah I

00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:41,830
that's the marketing team but uh yeah

00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:44,290
I've taken advantage of the coffee as

00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:46,810
well so yeah like I said thank you guys

00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:49,120
I think everyone solar and spark

00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:54,960
hands-on will show you this stuff live

00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:54,960
