Title: Berlin Buzzwords 2016: Ted Dunning - Fast Cars, Big Data - How Streaming Can Help Formula 1 #bbuzz
Publication date: 2016-06-12

Description: 
	Modern cars produce data. Lots of data. And Formula 1 cars produce more than their share.

I will present a working demonstration of how modern data streaming can be applied to the data acquisition and analysis problem posed by modern motorsports.

Instead of bringing multiple Formula 1 cars to the talk, I will show how we instrumented a high fidelity physics-based automotive simulator to produce realistic data from simulated cars running on the Spa-Francorchamps track. We move data from the cars, to the pits, to the engineers back at HQ.

The result is near real-time visualization and comparison of performance and a great exposition of how to move data using messaging systems like Kafka. The code from this talk will be made available as open source.
