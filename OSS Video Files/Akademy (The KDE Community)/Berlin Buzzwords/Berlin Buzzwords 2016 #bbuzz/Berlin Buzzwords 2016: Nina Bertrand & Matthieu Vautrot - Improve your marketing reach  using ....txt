Description: 
	Nina Bertrand and Matthieu Vautrot talking about "Project use case: Improve your marketing reach using large scale machine learning on Spark"

We observed that marketing teams of major companies tend to build their marketing campaigns based on study of client segmentation and market analysis which can be an heavy workload that directly deteriorate its ROI.

Using our client Big Data - 6 000 000 client informations on a Hadoop / Spark Cluster  we tried an other approach to dramaticaly increase the agility for building and tayloring new marketing campaigns.

We used Test&Learn methodolgies to increase the "uplift" of the campaigns inspired by the multi-armed bandit problem and implemented the whole approach in Apache Spark.
In this talk we want to share our feedbacks on the approach the success we had and probably more importantly the pitfalls we encountered.

	00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:08,700
sometimes it's it's fun and we are going

00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:13,590
to talk to you so Nina is going to talk

00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:17,070
to you and myself yeah magic so a quick

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:20,789
word on what we are going to talk to you

00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:23,220
about today is so share of experience on

00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,800
an ongoing project project see stila is

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,019
still running but still we we drafted

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,449
something that is we found a quite

00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:32,070
interesting and and we won't already

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,989
want to share some thermal suits and

00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,630
some feedback to maybe have a discussion

00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:39,570
later to have to see if you agree on

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:42,780
that with a wiggly approach so i can t

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:45,840
is a is someone who is running a big

00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:49,079
insurance company and he also has a part

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,700
with doing a banking and this client is

00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,789
used to do a lot of marketing campaign

00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,879
to seller to sell their project tour to

00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:58,859
the client and they asked us the general

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,050
question now we have the data we have a

00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:02,789
nice Hadoop cluster and so on can you do

00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,439
better with big data and what we have

00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:11,880
been doing as usual so okay well we'll

00:01:06,439 --> 00:01:14,430
see and just a little bit a little world

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,380
on the use case on itself the campaign

00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,049
that was going to be challenged with the

00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:23,310
Big Data approach is what was this

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:25,409
following is a as presently the client

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,259
is mostly an insurance company so it has

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:31,380
a more than 5 million clients in in his

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:32,820
insurance pot and he also running a bank

00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,640
and there is less than 1 million

00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,710
calenton in this part so his goal is to

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,710
say okay I have a lot of clients engine

00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,140
trans but the path can you can we make a

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:46,049
campaign that speaks to my insurance

00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,270
people and try to put them to the

00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:52,340
banking add to the banking a banking

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:55,320
part and to do so we we can we can use a

00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:57,509
simple display can eligible marketing

00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,340
tools to try to reach to speak to those

00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:02,280
guys to try to convince them to join the

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:05,100
bank so we can use displays with the use

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,320
of a GM key or all the tagging of their

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,629
own site to push them out some ad

00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,700
campaigns or we can reach them three

00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,950
mailing will cool emails will receive a

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,319
regularly

00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:17,540
from them and under it you can also

00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:21,800
direct call them with the use of agent

00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:23,870
and so on so quick words on the the

00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,510
state of the art of their of the data

00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:28,849
and what we are coming from they have a

00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:31,970
nice Hadoop cluster okay they've

00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:34,069
separated the two data sets from the

00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:36,590
banking side and the insurance sides in

00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:39,349
two separated demands something quite

00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:42,709
usual in to respect the legal legal

00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:44,540
legal constraints because if you have a

00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:47,000
mutable practice you are not too low to

00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:49,610
merge all your activity into one single

00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,620
tenant so there's two Potter are quite

00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:53,299
easily so it was quite a constraint in

00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:56,480
in the beginning so the present it like

00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:58,489
that so we have a lot of client activity

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,500
data all the classical customer

00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:02,870
relationship management that are the CRM

00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:05,420
and all the activity when do they

00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:07,519
contact me how often they do they call

00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:10,280
her call me and so on what their what

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:13,280
they are what was the lastest accident

00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,590
they had and so on and so on so as we

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,420
consider don't we say of course we can

00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:20,660
be better with big data and you can do

00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,769
that okay as a good consistent we don't

00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,359
really know what we are going to do

00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:25,250
before before setting the project that

00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:28,340
we say so we can we always can improve

00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:30,470
things so we come back and say okay what

00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:32,900
what can we do better than then what's

00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:36,200
what they have been doing so for fall

00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:38,780
for for so long we looked at what they

00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,269
usually do in in the in the general and

00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,680
the classical score in campaign they do

00:03:41,269 --> 00:03:46,010
something like that like a lot of people

00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,959
do when they do as a classical marketing

00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:50,569
campaign is they do a score and a 10

00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:52,489
score to see who is going to be likely

00:03:50,569 --> 00:03:54,650
to buy the project on earth so what I do

00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:57,790
is ok we trained accredited model on the

00:03:54,650 --> 00:04:00,109
client days on a client base on already

00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,299
people that have been already by about

00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:03,709
the project to try to understand why

00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:05,930
those people have bought the things and

00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:07,790
so maybe to find other people that's 11

00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:10,160
but the project that share the same

00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,870
characteristic so the sheet a predictive

00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,329
model like that and then they apply the

00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:16,639
model to the holder kinda today's score

00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:18,739
the best the best the best people that

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,870
I've been targeted by the by the model

00:04:18,739 --> 00:04:22,520
and send a message to them because say

00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:27,050
okay the model dell told us that you are

00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:31,410
going to be be likely to buy a layup

00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:34,470
s'okay this is a and from that we try to

00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:36,150
find to the limitations of the of this

00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:39,750
approach what are the problems of this

00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:41,729
this classical approach we found two

00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,610
major limitation of the problem of the

00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:47,040
approach that usually makes those kind

00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:48,690
of approach good but that we can see

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,300
improve the first thing is that there is

00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:53,040
a lack of personalization in big data we

00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:55,889
like to say that we have so much data

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,660
that we can know exactly how is my

00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:59,160
consumer what do they like and try to

00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,770
pass neither little bit the message we

00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,570
are going to to send to them so one

00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:06,060
problem is that the sending the same

00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:08,460
message to the top scorer people okay

00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,229
why not and another limitation of this

00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:12,300
approach is that they also scoop with

00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:15,389
this approach the natural noise which

00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:17,580
means but when you push some project to

00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:19,560
push the message to some some people you

00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,139
are spending some money to to contact

00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,639
them but the among those people that

00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:25,530
should be targeted some people would

00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:27,870
have died by your project anyway because

00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:30,360
the model will find some things that are

00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:32,729
based on the population not based only

00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,860
by the project the message attribute

00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:36,360
push it not by influenced by the bells

00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,550
message it would have bought the project

00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,740
anyway so another being interesting to

00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:45,570
bother them with a with an email or

00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:47,490
something like that so to to tackle the

00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:50,580
first problem okay we have one message

00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:53,010
to shoot to a group of people so maybe

00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:55,710
we will send multiple message yeah with

00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:58,680
a with a good insight here so here the

00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:00,270
idea is okay instead of sending one

00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,370
single message will try to do it a bit

00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:04,199
of personalization in your campaign it

00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:06,270
with the apologies that for some people

00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:07,889
you are going to contact some some of

00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,690
them will like to hear some kind of

00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:11,280
message some kind of arguments some

00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:13,050
would like to hear other arguments and

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,940
will push the right message to the right

00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:17,849
person so we can have a different

00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,530
appreciation on the target on the

00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:22,470
message we are pushing so that people

00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:27,210
will come will find a thing that are are

00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:30,449
more they most likely more so so years

00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:32,430
now there are four tackle is ok now we

00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:35,310
have a complex a little bit of problem

00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:37,229
we have to find a way to dispatch the

00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,750
right message to the to the same pair to

00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:41,580
the good person

00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:43,800
so to this to do so there's a classical

00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:46,110
approach in a machine learning and data

00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:49,169
sense is that we are going to do what we

00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:52,199
call test and learn is that it it's the

00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:54,419
good lunge large line is saying okay

00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:56,789
it's it's okay if at first you are quite

00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:58,830
done in your prediction you'll do some

00:06:56,789 --> 00:07:01,229
some stupid things but you are going to

00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:03,710
learn quite quite fast and improve

00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:06,719
regularly with a small incremental

00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:08,580
incremental think so you you you do

00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:11,069
stupid things at the beginning that the

00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,900
model is going to improve as as you're

00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:15,900
trying to push massage as you are

00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:18,539
getting back the results and try to find

00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:21,060
to find convergence and some are some

00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:23,879
rules so yeah the idea of test and learn

00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:25,830
is that ok we're going to push almost

00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:27,270
randomly at first the different message

00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:30,840
on some small small part of the

00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:33,389
population and try to find as we are

00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:35,669
studying the result the feedbacks if we

00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:39,210
find a better and better in the ruse to

00:07:35,669 --> 00:07:43,050
lure to make a Magus kind of occasion so

00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:45,930
testing man yes so how did we do that

00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:50,550
exactly with their with their are the

00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:52,650
part that as toll was a data lake all

00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:55,469
stole everything stored in a in a Hadoop

00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:57,479
HDFS we have all the data from the

00:07:55,469 --> 00:07:59,190
insurance path and by the way we get rid

00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:01,110
of the banking path because we didn't

00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:03,479
really need because we are targeting the

00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:05,909
insurance people so no need of worrying

00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:07,889
about legal issues we are just going to

00:08:05,909 --> 00:08:10,560
walk on the insurance data so it's a

00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:13,259
simpler life so we've had a Hadoop

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,539
cluster here we have the classical p

00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:17,159
higher technology and some Sparky that's

00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:20,279
going around in this for this kind of

00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:22,289
cluster and the upper part is all the

00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:24,750
people that have been eagerly waited to

00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:26,610
be contacted by males and spams and so

00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:29,669
on not stopped amazing nice very nice

00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:32,490
campaigns so first thing to do is okay

00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:35,159
at day 0 I'll try to sample a random

00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,079
random something of our client database

00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:40,680
a small percentage of a kind database

00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:42,630
and okay i say this client will receive

00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:46,230
randomly this message and so on and so

00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:49,020
on and every day so it's a bit different

00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:51,630
but what it says here is that every day

00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,290
i'm going to send to my people garden

00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,480
too

00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:55,769
the campaign a set of rule to say okay

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,480
this guy is going to receive this

00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:59,070
message this guy is going to be

00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:04,889
contacted by this guy with this kind of

00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:06,839
message and so on so KD 0 and then we

00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:10,620
contact those people okay we push the

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:13,410
message fine and we get the feedbacks

00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:16,440
every day we dumped back to the to the

00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:18,569
dialect Hadoop cluster all the response

00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,490
that we observed for the fourth day say

00:09:18,569 --> 00:09:22,889
okay who among the people that I've been

00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:25,139
contacted who like who clicked on this

00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:26,910
message who answered positively to this

00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:30,540
message we didn't like it and so on and

00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:33,240
so on so once we get it back to the to

00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:35,190
the Hadoop cluster we have to redo some

00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,290
reconciliation on between the cookies ID

00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:39,660
and the client database that we can join

00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:42,149
back every information with all the data

00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:43,949
we have in in our in our data lake to

00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:45,959
build a future mattress bill the

00:09:43,949 --> 00:09:48,360
training data set that we are going to

00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:50,269
try to fit a model with Parkins back hem

00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,560
just to put one we use the father

00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:55,680
detecting in that appropriation pig and

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,810
hive because because it was more reduced

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,089
and also because it was a little bit

00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:01,500
safer for preserving the resource for

00:10:00,089 --> 00:10:03,329
those Park Lester a lot of people while

00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,339
using this back at the same time so it

00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:08,130
was trying to use a highland kick that

00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:10,319
what question untouched the quite more

00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:12,389
mostly to do this heavy workload the

00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:17,190
demand machine learning path we did it

00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:20,670
on with a whisper hmmm and then we do a

00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:23,100
loop like that a day n plus 1 we once we

00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:25,380
reach and a mattress and whisk all the

00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:28,440
whole client database we used these

00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:30,600
results to push a new rules for the day

00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,889
after say okay now I've my first

00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,889
prediction based on what i would suggest

00:10:31,889 --> 00:10:36,389
today i can do a bit smarter prediction

00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:38,970
on who is going to like this message on

00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:41,149
that and therefore i can be a bit more

00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:44,240
efficient on the on the on the path or

00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:47,760
taking a lot of time i'm going to hurry

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:50,130
okay so so this is the general approach

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,350
and how we're going to to find the best

00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:54,630
message to push to the same to do to the

00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:57,149
good person will do loops like that and

00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:59,819
once we observe that we we have a

00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:01,589
stabilization and click rate ratio like

00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:03,779
people we are going to them to click so

00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:05,519
Anton we will know that the right

00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:06,089
message have been targeted to the Vikon

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,980
of people

00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:09,930
and then we can push through the whole

00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,029
time database the generalization we have

00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:16,829
been doing on smaller smaller part and

00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:18,839
some some Toyota examples okay so we now

00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:21,720
have a strategy to push the right

00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:24,480
message to the right person let us see

00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:26,670
another problem is how to get rid of the

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,279
natural noise how can we make sure that

00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:33,559
when we push message tone someone is

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,559
going to be positive positively

00:11:33,889 --> 00:11:38,699
positively contacted by this message and

00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:40,889
not being annoyed by bison by receiving

00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:42,360
this and say okay you send me an email

00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:44,550
and so on I don't want to contact you

00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:45,629
anymore so to try to get rid of that you

00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,790
know is going to talk to you a little

00:11:45,629 --> 00:11:51,889
bit on how we did that with with some

00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:56,459
some type of machine learning approaches

00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:59,699
up to you Nina so we would like to get

00:11:56,459 --> 00:12:04,019
rid of this noise so we use another

00:11:59,699 --> 00:12:08,490
approach which is called a pit models so

00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:12,329
quickly the main idea of this modeling

00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:17,360
is to describe the message effect on the

00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:22,529
targets on the day of the project so

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:26,569
there are four groups of customers we do

00:12:22,529 --> 00:12:30,480
we don't want to call three of them they

00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:33,959
do not disturb customers and the lost

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:37,170
causes the shoppings that are already

00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:41,600
convinced to buy the project and we

00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:46,079
would like to target the parables the

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:52,649
customers were the call as positive

00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:56,759
impact on them so to measure this impact

00:12:52,649 --> 00:12:59,160
we have two two-digit dissociated two

00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:02,730
groups so the first one is the treatment

00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:06,389
group the one who received the college

00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:10,620
email and the other one is the control

00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:16,379
group which which corresponds to the the

00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:20,370
placebo why don't be a dinner call so

00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:25,660
the difference possible implementations

00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:29,110
we use the first one and if you want to

00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:33,300
find information for the two other you

00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:36,220
can fight it in the literature so

00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:39,700
independent Modell's was the the choice

00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:47,050
you made I'll explain later why we made

00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:53,380
this choice so in real life we have to

00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:56,830
to build many model one model / kernel

00:13:53,380 --> 00:14:02,530
and power message and every model are

00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:06,430
independent and we considered to

00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:10,810
classical machine learning methods which

00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:17,880
was random forest and logistic logistic

00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:22,990
regression so in the valid model is a

00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:27,430
was a choice because it's easy to code

00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:30,370
in every technology and it corresponds

00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:33,760
to make the difference between two

00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:37,900
probabilities so the first one is the

00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:40,690
probability of purchase after the the

00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:47,860
campaign and the other one is the

00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:50,910
natural convection so the there is main

00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:55,270
difficulty with this approach it's

00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:58,660
because there is a predicted uplift by

00:14:55,270 --> 00:15:03,070
customer but we don't know in reality if

00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:05,890
the call of the email as an impact to

00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:11,380
the choice of the the customer so they

00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:15,250
are no real uplift by customer so no

00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:19,090
individual track tired so I can we

00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:23,800
measure this performance the solution is

00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:27,820
to sort customers by the uplift score in

00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:32,280
decreasing order and to make groups so

00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:33,490
we focused on decile of customers and

00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,790
then

00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:38,440
we calculate the difference between

00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:46,709
conversion rates of the treated group

00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:54,510
and the control one so to illustrate

00:15:46,709 --> 00:16:01,029
this is an appearance modem there the

00:15:54,510 --> 00:16:06,040
group's sorted by this disco the the

00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:09,130
blue one and there is in red the uplift

00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:11,560
which is the difference between the do

00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:14,190
commercial rate with treatment and

00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:18,610
comments on rate without treatment and

00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:21,910
as you can see groups with iOS

00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:24,640
commercial scoff as not necessarily been

00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:33,330
scored with the highest uplift so we

00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:33,330
would like to focus on this group so we

00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:43,209
focused on this kind of model which is a

00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:47,350
pif model here is the what we would like

00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:51,339
to chop down this is a graph search it

00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:54,360
by the uplift car the predictive

00:16:51,339 --> 00:16:58,630
obliphica and in red you have the

00:16:54,360 --> 00:17:02,470
observed uplift and in the perfect

00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:09,329
uplift model it's older it's a

00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:13,709
decreasing order so in in all yours case

00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:20,920
what we've done is to use a tune message

00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:26,860
for this proof of concept and the GMP

00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:30,100
side is a is ongoing today but we can we

00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:35,380
have built two waves for the the curve

00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:39,340
and the emailing campaigns and we have

00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:43,030
built up lift model so is the the

00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:46,860
example of the main channel after the

00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:49,980
first wave so there were two message

00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:54,410
for the first one you can see that the

00:17:49,980 --> 00:18:00,000
message is really efficient because

00:17:54,410 --> 00:18:02,100
people in the left out do is code by the

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:07,049
model and you can see that the real

00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:10,230
uplift is really good but you have to

00:18:07,049 --> 00:18:14,880
know that some people ate this message

00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:20,090
so people on the right which have a low

00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:23,100
wasco we don't want you to call them and

00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:27,210
on the other side you have the second

00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:30,510
message which was come we simple your

00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:33,600
life and you can see that there is a

00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:37,919
small small postage like you like this

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:41,720
message but the main information is the

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:45,900
right of the the plots you can see that

00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:49,700
for these people you shouldn't call them

00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:54,150
because the the coal or the email as a

00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:58,350
negative influence on them so after

00:18:54,150 --> 00:19:01,890
after the build of these two models you

00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:06,750
just have to take the desk off between

00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:10,860
the two and to send the message the

00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:14,610
uplift medela consider the hilton is

00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:16,710
best cod yes just to conclude this

00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:18,750
little presentation and to reserve some

00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:20,340
time for the Q&A quick some quick

00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:23,460
feedbacks and pitfalls that we've been

00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:26,010
on controlling the first thing to say

00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,809
that on paper the the approach to do

00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:29,280
this test and none is quite simple

00:19:27,809 --> 00:19:31,410
because you say okay you just have to

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,660
share some ties between the jailed for

00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:35,669
example you GMP part and the data lake

00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,260
and then we will be fine with the with

00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:39,929
the learning but some business

00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:41,850
organization and IT organization as

00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:43,530
sometimes quite chilly too heavy to

00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:45,870
manipulate that plus there is some

00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:47,580
political choice to do that so they want

00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:49,710
you to do a lot of proof of concept

00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:52,620
before involving more resource to eat so

00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:54,990
we spend more time to try to prove the

00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:58,559
approach before trying to push all the

00:19:54,990 --> 00:20:00,750
efforts to this pipelining so to gain

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:03,240
sometimes spark is good

00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:05,040
we have a sparking in our cluster but to

00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,840
accelerate a little bit our development

00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,690
for the for the training to find a good

00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:12,030
model and so on we did the first couple

00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:15,120
of rounds on the psychic land and then

00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:18,150
for the most more in disguises way we

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,100
then record things on on the spot when

00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:21,810
we knew a little bit more what we wanted

00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:24,570
to do because we gain some time like

00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:27,360
that and one quick world and on the

00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:29,280
results it's even we're quite excited on

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,040
on showing the on having those kind of

00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,140
results because we yeah we observed that

00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:36,300
it was quite the efficient who gettin

00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:38,010
some new insights and insights on your

00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,690
marketing campaigns some kind of result

00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:42,690
they never saw they never control who

00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:44,700
liked or don't like the message and you

00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:46,770
can you know that with this approach you

00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,510
can control it a bit better what people

00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:50,640
want to hear doesn't want you here so

00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:52,950
here we can say okay people of course

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,500
tends to be more reactive to message

00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:57,480
that will hand them money but some

00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:59,850
people would like also to hear that they

00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:01,890
are going be still better i contain with

00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:04,950
the with the with the same same product

00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:07,230
and of course you know have a PID on who

00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:09,720
you should definitely not contact with

00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:11,400
those because with those guys if you if

00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,290
you push image to them you are going to

00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,720
lose them because even though they would

00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:18,390
have come to your project without being

00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,430
a big challenge to impale you please

00:21:18,390 --> 00:21:23,540
conclude our a little presentation on

00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:26,250
this angie's choose case and if you have

00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:28,640
questions we will be glad to answer them

00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,640
yes

00:21:33,749 --> 00:21:37,919
is not closed by the bias

00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:57,059
it's a from the initial database of the

00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:59,100
old kind that is been eligible to the

00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:00,960
project we just make sure that there is

00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:04,350
some people that will never we never

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:06,570
send email which weary separate the two

00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:08,759
groups some people we observe we observe

00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:11,309
them like that with okay are they buying

00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:13,590
the project without without having to

00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:15,899
hear the message and the other group are

00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:18,149
they buying the project if they once

00:22:15,899 --> 00:22:19,830
I've been contacted so we really measure

00:22:18,149 --> 00:22:22,649
the two different ratio like that and

00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:27,360
and after that we can measure the Delta

00:22:22,649 --> 00:22:29,250
to store to sort them by a pistol so

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,600
yeah it's one difficulty is that you

00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:32,220
have to make sure that your placebo

00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,590
group is really left untouched because

00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:36,059
sometimes if you are like a bad joint

00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:38,429
all but something like that you will

00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:40,230
contact people that you should do

00:22:38,429 --> 00:22:41,610
shouldn't have contact and messer mess

00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:44,190
the whole result so you have to be real

00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:48,090
good on a separating splitting those

00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:50,490
kind of groups thank you Matt yo Nino oh

00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:53,720
we have time for one last question and

00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:57,169
the rest of them you can take it offline

00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,169
do you need a mic

00:23:04,269 --> 00:23:13,869
yes yes actually it was a something that

00:23:11,379 --> 00:23:16,899
makes sense by mathematically speaking

00:23:13,869 --> 00:23:18,909
we want to group as big as possible that

00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:22,209
we still left as room as possible for

00:23:18,909 --> 00:23:24,039
doing a lot of iteration and plus some

00:23:22,209 --> 00:23:28,239
political constraints on what the budget

00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:33,159
I have to burn on a random random use so

00:23:28,239 --> 00:23:34,989
we we aimed at something like 100 107

00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:39,159
people for the first campaign something

00:23:34,989 --> 00:23:44,109
like that 305,000 and in order of

00:23:39,159 --> 00:23:46,179
magnitude something like that okay so if

00:23:44,109 --> 00:23:50,639
you have any question we will be glad to

00:23:46,179 --> 00:23:50,639
