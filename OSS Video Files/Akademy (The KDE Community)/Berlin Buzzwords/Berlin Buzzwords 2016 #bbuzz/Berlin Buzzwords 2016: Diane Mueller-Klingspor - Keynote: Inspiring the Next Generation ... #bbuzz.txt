Description: 
	In her keynote "Inspiring the Next Generation to Run Away and Join Our Software Circus" she describes how we can all create magical experiences that inspire and connect under-represented communities to new technologies. Producing sufficient numbers of graduates who are prepared for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) occupations has become a national priority around the globe. 

We all have a responsibility to onboard, attract and enroll new entrants to STEM if you care about the future of open innovation. In this keynote, she will discuss how to combine connected learning principles to create and deliver new technology workshops to inspire and encourage under-represented and under-served communities.

	00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:08,320
well good morning and welcome to Berlin

00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:11,020
buzzwords I'm really pleased to be

00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,020
invited here today I'm going to try and

00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:16,810
talk a little bit about what we're doing

00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:18,640
to inspire the next generation of folks

00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:20,109
to come in and join this wonderful

00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,919
circus of software and hardware

00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:26,529
development that we're working on I work

00:00:23,919 --> 00:00:28,990
on red hat for red hat my day job I work

00:00:26,529 --> 00:00:30,369
on openshift and OpenStack and Cooper

00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,539
Nettie's and docker and all that good

00:00:30,369 --> 00:00:35,380
stuff but I'm not going to talk about

00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:39,220
any of that this morning I'm coming off

00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:41,590
a weekend of Maker Faires we just hosted

00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:45,190
our second annual Maker Faire this is a

00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:47,470
kind of a cloudy map but this is then

00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,450
just north of vancouver in British

00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:51,610
Columbia Canada which I flew in from

00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:53,980
yesterday so it's about twelve-thirty

00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:57,130
a.m. my time so I'm standing up which is

00:00:53,980 --> 00:01:00,280
a good thing this is our second Maker

00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:03,040
Faire that we did on the coast I'm about

00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:06,159
a 45-minute boat ride up on the mainland

00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:09,549
in from Vancouver BC if you know the

00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:12,850
west coast of Canada and where I live is

00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:15,939
about five communities which make up

00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:18,490
about 30,000 people that's adults kids

00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:20,920
in everything and we had over a thousand

00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:24,249
of them show up for a one-day Maker

00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,259
Faire and so what we've been do what's

00:01:24,249 --> 00:01:28,630
been happening and if any of any of you

00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:30,100
live in cities you realize that it's

00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,350
very expensive to live in the cities and

00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,999
a lot of people are migrating up to the

00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:36,340
coast and so we're getting a lot of tech

00:01:33,999 --> 00:01:38,380
folks and so the Sunshine Coast is

00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:42,189
actually the fastest growing maker

00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:45,450
community in all of Canada right now and

00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:47,709
this is the crew that I work with on

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,850
it's probably your call the Coast makers

00:01:47,709 --> 00:01:50,740
and we're the ones that put it on

00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:52,389
there's a whole bunch more but this was

00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:54,159
the only ones i could get to come around

00:01:52,389 --> 00:01:55,299
and for the picture that we're opposing

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,299
that day and we're called the coast

00:01:55,299 --> 00:02:02,229
makers and we do all this stuff but i

00:01:58,299 --> 00:02:03,880
started a project in collaboration with

00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:07,090
all the coast makers called get maker

00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:09,160
labs and what i do in my day job is i'm

00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:11,319
a technology evangelist and a community

00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,330
manager or otherwise known as a cat

00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:15,489
herder i try and get folks to work on my

00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:16,400
open source projects and so i'm taking

00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:19,519
some of those

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:23,180
bills and using that to teach teachers

00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:26,299
and teach students how to teach tech in

00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:29,060
the school systems and what we've been

00:02:26,299 --> 00:02:32,689
doing is creating mobile maker spaces

00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:35,000
and those mobile maker spaces are using

00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:36,590
some new concepts called connected

00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,849
learning which comes out of Stanford

00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,769
University and I'm going to talk a

00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:42,319
little bit about that today and how

00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:44,480
we're using these things to try and get

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,370
to the next level and the next

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,840
generation of people who will be doing

00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,730
the jobs that you're doing so your

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,760
replacements is what I'm trying to

00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:55,790
inspire um so first a bit of history

00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,709
because I'm always shocked at how long

00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:00,799
I've managed to stay in this business

00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:03,790
and about a year ago I was in the

00:03:00,799 --> 00:03:05,900
computer computer history museum down in

00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:08,810
Silicon Valley and if you ever get a

00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:13,370
chance please go it's wonderful the sad

00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:15,230
thing is i'm in the history museum so

00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:17,629
when i started my career back in the

00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:20,239
early 80s my first job I to the

00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:21,829
University was working for Nike i love

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,209
to call them the sneaker people they

00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:27,500
like to be called the athletic footwear

00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:30,410
people and i did all of the cad cam and

00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:33,260
cnc machining work to do the souls of

00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:36,440
sneakers so sneaker bottoms these things

00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:38,930
and it was really fun used all the math

00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:40,760
skills that I inspires and curves and

00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:44,090
all that kind of fun stuff and the

00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:46,849
machine that i sat on and that that the

00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:49,069
big huge tube and the CNC machines cost

00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:51,290
over a million dollars just for my one

00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:52,790
place that I was sitting out with the

00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:55,280
software the training all the

00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:57,919
connectivity and all of that has now

00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,379
been commoditized so this is this is

00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:02,359
actually one of the molds that I worked

00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:07,239
on it's really and truly in the history

00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:10,549
museum but someday I'd like to retire

00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:12,949
and you know I I do all this community

00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:15,139
development stuff because basically what

00:04:12,949 --> 00:04:18,680
I'm looking for is I'm looking for my

00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:24,139
replacement so when I was at University

00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:27,349
back in 1982-83 I was one of three women

00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:29,090
in a computer science class a group that

00:04:27,349 --> 00:04:32,090
going through as freshmen

00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:35,150
and I'd like to see many more of us

00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:38,210
going through computer science this is

00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:40,669
my daughter I have to two girls there

00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:42,560
now 15 and 20 ones in University and the

00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:47,570
other ones two years into high school

00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,639
and what I started noticing was in the

00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:51,139
school system where they were going they

00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:53,990
were getting very bored in the IT

00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:55,940
classes or with computer class and when

00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:59,690
I asked and actually one of them this

00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:03,229
one hailey was kind of getting a bad

00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:06,350
grade and so I work in tech and my wife

00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:08,090
she's also a web designer so heck what's

00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:10,880
going on here these kids should be like

00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:14,450
acing this class and when I went in to

00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:18,320
talk to the teachers about my problem

00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:20,660
child what it was is they were teaching

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,820
the kids how to do PowerPoint they

00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:24,770
weren't doing anything interesting and

00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:27,080
it wasn't the teachers fault it was

00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,970
really and it wasn't the kids fall it

00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,919
was just the training and the background

00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,750
that the teachers were getting and the

00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:37,100
time that they are getting to do this

00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:40,370
was was not sufficient so what we did

00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:42,350
instead of you know giving heck to the

00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:45,139
teachers we decided that we would do

00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:46,789
something about that because it wasn't

00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:49,130
just the teachers in the elementary

00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:50,960
schools and the high schools but also AM

00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:53,530
if you're in North America they're

00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,479
currently declining enrollments in

00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:58,370
education around engineering computer

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,700
science not just for women but for

00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:04,610
everybody kids are not choosing to go

00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:07,030
into computer science anymore and or

00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:10,460
into engineering or into that so it's

00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:12,289
there's a episode of a problem that's at

00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:15,770
the center of all of this that we've

00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:20,060
really got to get to how do we get kids

00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:22,160
inspired to work on the things that are

00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:24,289
going to make our lives better as we get

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,330
older and bring in the new innovation so

00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:28,370
we're trying to figure out this problem

00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:31,970
and then there was another problem

00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:34,760
between like web designers like my wife

00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:37,159
and other people do the really cool

00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,990
stuff right mobile apps do use right all

00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:41,880
the services that run on top of things a

00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:43,470
really beautiful UI and fun stuff

00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,170
versus the people who are building

00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:48,030
infrastructure and so we really wanted

00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:50,100
to get kids to understand the

00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:53,370
underpinnings of the things that they

00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:55,650
were working on and to get to people to

00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:57,360
think like that to think not just on the

00:06:55,650 --> 00:07:00,510
surface level not just to use their

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,490
iphones or their iPads or their xboxes

00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:06,720
things think about how things work

00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:09,090
inside so I work for red hat so I have

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,720
to throw a Linux picture in here so

00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:14,730
Linux it's not so much fun to work on if

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,620
you're a linux kernel person and the

00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:20,370
Linux kernel communities idea of

00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:22,380
recruiting people is giving them popcorn

00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:24,330
and it didn't work you know that's not

00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,280
going to get a kid to start working on

00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:29,970
the linux kernel so we had to do

00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:33,000
something more so we came up with this

00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:36,210
idea wasn't just mine kids really like

00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:40,140
circuses all right so what we thought we

00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:41,550
would do is bring the circus to them but

00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,410
still when you have a circus somebody

00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:45,360
has to build the tent somebody has to

00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:47,040
put the tent up someone has to provide

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,020
the services that are going to be used

00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,750
underneath those tents so starting to

00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,730
teach all of the concepts that take it

00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:56,910
to the next level because if we don't

00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:59,490
start teaching those kids and inspiring

00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:01,710
them to be take part in those other

00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:03,090
pieces of the infrastructure and a

00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:06,750
project we're going to end up with

00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:08,400
bridges that don't work no services and

00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:11,040
the train stations and things like that

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:13,350
so there's really a compelling argument

00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,750
for all of you to get involved in your

00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:17,910
kids education and the education systems

00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:20,970
around around you because if you don't

00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:22,820
do this it's not just about inspiring

00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:26,160
the next generation it's about inspiring

00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:29,040
you all out there to get involved in

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,530
your schools and in yours in your kids

00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:35,370
education and in your neighborhood maker

00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:37,500
spaces because I it's berlin buzzword so

00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:40,590
i had to put one buzzword in there okay

00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:44,730
so stem the science tech in engineering

00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:47,400
and maths is really a very key thing in

00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:50,160
at least in north america that's one of

00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:52,860
the things next year in our british

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,070
columbia school system it's mandated

00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,410
that STEM education is part

00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:59,270
the first time the interesting thing

00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:02,150
about it is there's no training for the

00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:03,860
teachers so they mandating it to be part

00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:06,680
of the curriculum but there's no extra

00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:09,500
training so there was some work to be

00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,150
done here and I'm just going to pause

00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,130
for a minute to because the thing about

00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,900
it is a lot of people think and there

00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:17,930
are some great programs out there girls

00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:19,100
that code lady pi PI ladies all kinds of

00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:22,010
one of the things a lot of people think

00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:25,160
about getting kids into stem is teaching

00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:28,100
kids to code and I'd actually ask you to

00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:31,430
step back and think about the first time

00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:34,220
you really got that this stuff was cool

00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:38,060
that you're working on today like for me

00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:40,760
when I was I think i was ten my

00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:42,410
grandfather lived in germany and he

00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,090
would send Christmas presents back to my

00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:46,190
brother and I and he was getting a

00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:48,410
little bit older and he mixed up our

00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:52,130
ages and he sent my six-year-old brother

00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:53,780
a electronics kit to build one of those

00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:56,390
old-fashioned phones you know you lift

00:09:53,780 --> 00:10:00,620
off the receiver and my dad who was an

00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:01,940
engineer and German swapped the gifts it

00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:05,600
was the only thing that he did different

00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:08,960
he gave me the telephone kid and I put

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,060
it together with his help and I started

00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:13,310
to see everything that was inside of a

00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,290
telephone it was the first time I was

00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:16,820
ten you know I'd never seen electronics

00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:18,890
I'd never been allowed to take a phone

00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:21,770
apart or do any of those sorts of things

00:10:18,890 --> 00:10:23,900
but it wasn't what I call an epiphany a

00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:26,570
magic moment a connection with my dad

00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:29,150
and um connection with the technology

00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:31,880
that underneath the thing not today if

00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:35,380
you take apart your iPhone it didn't you

00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:37,490
know it breaks the warranty right if you

00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:39,320
really really you take part anything

00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:40,970
like that it's you know that's it that's

00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:43,220
the end of it you crack the glass it's

00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:45,370
gone believe me I have daughters and

00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:48,200
I've seen them dropped and toilets in

00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:50,270
lakes and oceans and everything so

00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:52,490
that's not a magical experience so we

00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:55,940
have to figure out where we can find

00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:58,550
those epiphany moments so rather than

00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:00,440
focusing on you know getting 10 year

00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:02,270
olds to learn how to do scratch which is

00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,910
a great thing or to use other

00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:07,340
programming what I've been focusing on

00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:08,310
is trying to figure out that how to

00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,620
bring

00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:12,360
magical moment to the kids that will

00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,550
connect them with technology in a way

00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,100
that will have continued through the

00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:19,800
rest of their lives because the

00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:22,560
traditional method of teaching we've all

00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:25,950
been there most of us didn't have the

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,980
opportunity to go through alternative

00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:31,050
schools so normally you sit like you are

00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:33,540
in the theater today and you get it gets

00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:35,490
pushed out on to you you're just the

00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:38,370
consumer you don't get to control what

00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:41,160
actually is being taught you don't drive

00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:43,110
the agenda the agenda is so you're going

00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,930
to pass these exams so you need to know

00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:48,540
these things and it's a lot of abstract

00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:52,880
concepts and it's very what I would say

00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:58,440
surface learning oops one time too many

00:11:52,880 --> 00:12:01,170
so learning is a process and for me it

00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,760
it is a very social process if you

00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:05,279
remember the time that you spent in your

00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:08,339
classes and everything it was about

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,740
being with your peers peer pressure all

00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:12,540
that good stuff and the environment in

00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:14,940
which you learn makes a really big

00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:17,970
difference so if you're sitting at a

00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:20,700
wooden desk with an inkwell and you know

00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:22,290
things aren't getting aren't advancing

00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,720
with the technology that you have at

00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:27,120
home things are going to be not jiving

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,220
in terms of what they want to learn and

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,230
lots of people learn in different ways

00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,210
and so when you're organizing programs

00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:37,860
for people you have to accommodate them

00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:39,750
and if people aren't comfortable in a

00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,240
classroom or if they're afraid of

00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:46,890
technology you have to accommodate for

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,150
that as well so for me teaching and this

00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,190
kind of falls into that community

00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:53,490
development stuff that I do during my

00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:55,589
day job is about organizing people and

00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:59,910
the environment in which they are

00:12:55,589 --> 00:13:02,040
learning in so there's a concept as i

00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:06,120
mentioned that came out of stanford

00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:09,510
university that i'm very in love with in

00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,680
terms of teaching connected learning so

00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:13,589
what we're trying to do is create

00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,600
interactive experiences that are

00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:17,070
collaborative so the kids are working

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,330
with each other they're working with the

00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:21,930
teachers they're working across

00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:24,839
generations they're doing very practical

00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:26,580
things so they make stuff and they take

00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:29,820
their ideas and their ideas or what

00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:32,790
drive the curriculum or the agenda of

00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:35,160
the day of the workshop there are never

00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:38,370
seen as being pushed on they are the

00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:41,399
co-creators in this space so this is

00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:43,260
really kind of import important and

00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,910
they're leveraging their peer networks

00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:47,370
so they're working with kids their own

00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:49,860
age they're leveraging and what we have

00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:52,170
in British Columbia is called the cool

00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:54,390
schools or the leadership programs and

00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:56,850
some high schools so we bring in kids of

00:13:54,390 --> 00:14:02,790
different ages so it's not the adult

00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:05,370
running the course so so what we try and

00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:07,800
do and is get the kids to teach each

00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:10,320
other so we work with some of the older

00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,779
kids then we once someone's gone through

00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,580
a workshop we make them the teachers for

00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:17,520
the next workshop so we've been doing a

00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:19,080
lot of work around this these are ten

00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,910
year old girls that are teaching each

00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:24,540
other a software package called

00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:28,230
Tinkercad and they're creating some of

00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:30,570
these wonderful printable things and one

00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:33,690
of the things we're really hot on is you

00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:36,870
can download a rubber duck or a Hello

00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:38,730
Kitty icon and printed it from

00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:40,770
thingiverse or one of the many other

00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:44,550
things but what we're trying to do is

00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:46,560
add have them modify the images so if

00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,420
you look closely here they've put their

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,430
name on and they've put a different base

00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,020
on and they've done stuff and they'd not

00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:54,930
even really aware that we're teaching

00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:57,330
them 3d spatial design they're just in

00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:59,730
Tinkercad they're just using it and it's

00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:03,150
not gamifying because they're using real

00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:05,520
tools but they're just doing things that

00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:07,640
kids do naturally they're exploring the

00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:09,750
tools and they're the ones that decide

00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:12,660
what they're going to put on it how

00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:16,230
they're going to extend it not not us by

00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:19,230
any means so the other thing that we do

00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:21,480
is we take because printing this is one

00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:23,220
lesson that we learn that printing

00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,260
things takes even one of these little

00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:29,130
small ones takes about an hour an hour

00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:31,890
and a half so instead be I'm not sure

00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:33,750
how bright this is the kids created an

00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:36,030
unreal engine game

00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:39,150
and drop their images into the Unreal

00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:40,680
Engine and started playing and much to

00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:42,960
my surprise the girls were creating

00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:47,010
first-person shooter games and shooting

00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:50,370
themselves so yeah ponytail sweetness

00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:55,050
and light and guns and we weren't in

00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:57,000
America we were in Canada so so there's

00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:59,850
a lot of this stuff is going on so all

00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,470
this connected learning is as stuff that

00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,660
I've learned in the past two and a half

00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:05,550
years of doing some of these workshops

00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,810
and the other thing that's going on at

00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,640
the same time is this whole maker

00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:10,230
movement you've got Fab Lab hear

00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,690
something called beta something or other

00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:14,430
here in Berlin and these are wonderful

00:16:12,690 --> 00:16:17,880
things this whole maker movement has

00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:20,010
changed the way that we think about it

00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,690
it's like basically took taking what my

00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:24,330
dad did for me at 10 years old

00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:26,220
accidentally on purpose I think because

00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:28,590
he was an engineer he was going to make

00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:32,880
an engineer out of one of us two kids my

00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:34,890
brother's a musician so but what the

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,120
makers do is they make cool stuff and

00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:38,100
make all kinds of stuff we play with

00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,830
Arduino zand minnow boards and raspberry

00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:43,589
pies and all kinds of fun stuff but it's

00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:45,740
mostly boys if you ever go into a

00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:47,600
makerspace it's kind of intimidating

00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:50,670
though everybody is very

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,920
well-intentioned it's very intimidating

00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:58,470
for a ten-year-old girl to go into one

00:16:52,920 --> 00:17:00,000
of those spaces and an emoti sty was

00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:01,740
just in Austin Texas a couple weeks ago

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,540
and not only that but there's an age

00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:05,310
thing you have to be there with a parent

00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,780
and if you're not if you're not over 18

00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:08,790
you have to bring a parent you have to

00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:11,610
sign a waiver and there's like all this

00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:13,770
extra stuff so it's pretty cool then

00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:17,459
then there's more cool stuff at Maker

00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:20,100
Faires but those are mostly in big

00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:22,380
cities we did start our own within our

00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:25,470
things but there one off so it happens

00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:26,939
one time a year and that's not enough if

00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,490
you're trying to get people to have

00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:31,680
epiphany moments we did we headed over a

00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:34,560
thousand kids go through our workshops

00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:37,140
and was a one day sunday event and which

00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,430
was amazing because there's only 30,000

00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,650
people that I mentioned that in the

00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:43,020
entire Coast and a thousand of of their

00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:45,960
kids showed up and they came not just

00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,630
from our communities on the coast but

00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,640
some of the I

00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:50,740
and from downtown Vancouver as well it

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:53,530
was pretty amazing but it was really a

00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:59,350
one-time event and then there's maker

00:17:53,530 --> 00:18:02,790
spaces which are great but it's kind of

00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:06,880
for me a zoo versus circuses so the zoo

00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:08,770
is where you keep the geeks and you put

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,920
them in the zoo and people come to it

00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:13,570
and the circuses are the Maker Faires so

00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:19,120
we bring that and we set them up for

00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:20,950
them right now so I think of them the

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,350
problem for us with maker spaces with

00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:24,850
only having 30,000 people is that

00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:26,590
they're in Berlin you can do that you

00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:28,990
have enough center of gravity enough

00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:31,750
people to actually join and be part of

00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:34,920
and pay for the rental costs and all

00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:37,930
that but there are fixed locations and

00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:39,970
there's a lot of overhead for us to do

00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:42,160
that it doesn't quite work when you have

00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:45,670
a community a rural community that

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:48,010
spread across an entire coastline and

00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:50,020
for us and british columbia we have not

00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:52,480
only the schools to think about but the

00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:55,870
First Nations kids that are living in on

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:58,060
the reservations and on band lands that

00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:00,040
we want to reach we have islands that we

00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:03,700
have to get to we have fairies that we

00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:06,610
have to take we're very distributed

00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:09,370
Canada is a vast country and there's a

00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:10,900
lot of people in very rural situations

00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:14,170
that aren't going to have enough money

00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:18,670
or enough bandwidth to actually be able

00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:22,090
to have a zoo for geeks so we were

00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:24,310
trying to figure out two things besides

00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:25,780
how do we deal with this that the high

00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:28,660
overhead for the cost for the maker

00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:32,260
space but also to give them a ticket

00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:34,510
into the zoo all right so you want to

00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:36,400
have that epiphany moment but you also

00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:38,950
want to give them something that's the

00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,790
excuse to go into a makerspace or to go

00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:44,800
the next step beyond just doing the

00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:48,250
one-time workshop at a maker faire and

00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:51,130
so we decided that we would bring the

00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:56,170
circus to them and so what we did was we

00:19:51,130 --> 00:20:00,100
took a 1965 l.joe trailer and gutted it

00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:04,419
completely and put inside of it a lab

00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:05,799
to 3d printers a human-sized turntable

00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:08,020
I'll show you some pictures of all this

00:20:05,799 --> 00:20:10,299
in a minute and we built this out

00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:12,130
together and we decided that we would

00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:16,000
try and create a very welcoming

00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:18,549
environment there are little Persian

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,140
rugs inside there's a couch there's a

00:20:18,549 --> 00:20:22,900
pink point there's always a pink pony

00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:25,440
there's usually a knitter outside like

00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:28,539
in Tale of Two Cities taking the names

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:31,390
just trying to make the atmosphere very

00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:33,700
laid-back not clinical not like a lab

00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:38,980
but something really friendly that

00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:41,110
anybody would walk in the door to so the

00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:42,940
other piece of it was not only were we

00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:45,580
trying to bring this space to them but

00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,500
what we wanted to do was not intimidate

00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:49,840
the teachers because some of the

00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:52,000
teachers hadn't had tech training before

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:55,330
some of the lot of the teachers are

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,159
women who haven't had don't have that

00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:00,520
didn't have that epiphany moment that I

00:20:57,159 --> 00:21:02,710
had at 10 and so any of this technology

00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,350
you really have to work with the

00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:07,780
teachers and get them on board find the

00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:10,419
champions in the school systems and have

00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:12,700
them understand the technology well

00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:14,679
enough so that then they can host the

00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:18,070
trailer coming to them and host the

00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:21,159
workshops and so a lot of the time that

00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:23,020
is a front time teaching teachers about

00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:25,780
the technology so I've done things like

00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:28,450
host a wine and cheese night at my house

00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:30,130
with a trailer and everybody's sipping

00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:31,330
wine and they're scanning each other

00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:33,580
they're doing the work and they're

00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:36,820
getting they're figuring out how to run

00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:39,789
one of these workshops because the other

00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:42,970
thing is inside the trailer it's a very

00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:46,179
simple setup it's not it's not perfect

00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:48,789
okay so i'm not making perfect 3d scans

00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:51,190
of people i'm doing something that's

00:21:48,789 --> 00:21:54,490
rather low budget we're using xbox

00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:57,309
connects we're not trying to make the

00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:59,590
perfect scan because that's one teachers

00:21:57,309 --> 00:22:01,150
can't afford that they can't afford they

00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:02,409
can't replicate that so you have to

00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:04,570
think about what it is that you're

00:22:02,409 --> 00:22:06,669
bringing to them can they replicate it

00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:10,210
can they host it themselves can they

00:22:06,669 --> 00:22:13,059
build it out themselves so what we did

00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:13,929
was we built a 3d selfie booth everybody

00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:16,179
knows what

00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:18,309
Althea's everybody's taken a selfie so

00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:20,649
the recognition of or what the idea is

00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:23,889
here and we didn't say that it was any

00:22:20,649 --> 00:22:26,559
more than that and there were five steps

00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:28,840
that we're trying to teach to them to

00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:31,389
the kids one is scanning creating a 3d

00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:33,039
image so this is making something other

00:22:31,389 --> 00:22:36,490
than a rubber duck or a Hello Kitty

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:38,740
model or a Lego chip something that they

00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:41,499
could actually see themselves and you

00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:43,990
get to see yourself in 3d for the first

00:22:41,499 --> 00:22:46,480
time the first time I ever saw myself in

00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:49,179
3d i was in new york and the Shapeways

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,100
folks had were hosting something and

00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:53,980
they did me in 3d and I could couldn't

00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,960
believe how bad my posture was I was

00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:59,049
standing like this and in the model like

00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,879
that's not me but it is me but you don't

00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:03,789
realize that you've never seen yourself

00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:06,190
in 3d until you see yourself in 3d and

00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:09,220
then there's cleaning it up modding it

00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:11,080
slicing it and printing it and so that's

00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:13,659
what we'd like to do this is me inside

00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:16,419
of the trailer we're using Xbox Kinect

00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:20,950
you can see some there this is the human

00:23:16,419 --> 00:23:24,879
sized turntable that we built out it

00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:26,740
goes around rather slowly it's portable

00:23:24,879 --> 00:23:28,450
so we don't have to keep it we can take

00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:31,929
it out of there we can move it someplace

00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:35,350
else and basically it's a single Xbox

00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:37,090
Kinect hooked up to a machine a larger

00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:39,309
desktop machine that's running Windows

00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:43,480
10 yes i am a red hat person and i'm

00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:45,369
running windows 10 it's okay and windows

00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:48,369
has some wonderful software now if

00:23:45,369 --> 00:23:50,230
anybody opens at stl file on a Windows

00:23:48,369 --> 00:23:52,779
10 desktop it just automatically pops

00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:54,700
into 3d builder it's pretty amazing it's

00:23:52,779 --> 00:23:57,460
not open source yet though so we're

00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:59,169
going to work on that what is another

00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:01,210
piece of software that if you don't want

00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:04,090
to use the windows you can use the older

00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:07,139
version of xbox connects and they'll

00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:09,429
work wonderful with some software called

00:24:07,139 --> 00:24:13,259
schenectady builder though does

00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:16,059
full-color scans and that's pretty cool

00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:18,249
so one of the things that we also teach

00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:20,080
them about is cleaning up software and

00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:23,440
there's a software package called mesh

00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,899
labs that we use and we teach kids how

00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,669
to when you scan someone if you miss the

00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:28,300
top of their heads often they'll be a

00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:29,620
hole in

00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:33,580
your head and that's where the light

00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:35,710
comes in and we teach them how to clean

00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:38,230
them up so that they get the next stage

00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:40,090
so and we're doing all this and they

00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:42,250
don't really realize that we're teaching

00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:44,590
them like new skills or anything they

00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:46,690
just want the scan they want themselves

00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:50,350
printed in 3d or they want to see

00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:54,910
themselves inside of the games so um

00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:58,360
this woman is Emily she's she and her

00:24:54,910 --> 00:25:01,900
husband who's 90 visited the workshop

00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:05,320
and it brings me to another point about

00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:07,270
the age we we tend to focus on just

00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:09,700
bringing these experiences to kids and

00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:11,530
making kids but when we bring these

00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,240
these workshops to folks the

00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:15,070
grandparents come the ground pants are

00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,590
bringing the kids it's just really

00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:19,600
starting to think about the spread of

00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:22,270
the ages of people that you can inspire

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:25,630
and get addicted to some of this so we

00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:27,700
teach the kids using Tinkercad which is

00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:29,590
from Autodesk a wonderful company and

00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,450
it's all free stuff so we're really

00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:33,760
trying to keep that the barrier to entry

00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:35,770
for all of this so that my kids don't

00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:39,220
just learn powerpoint they're going to

00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:42,220
learn Tinkercad mesh labs 3d builder all

00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:44,710
of this stuff is available and readily

00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:47,100
for free so the other really cool thing

00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:49,720
is that if you're in Tinkercad

00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:51,730
everybody's kids and most of us have all

00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:54,940
played minecraft you can export these

00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:58,600
scans directly into minecraft now so

00:25:54,940 --> 00:26:00,400
that's lots of fun and they're so the

00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:02,170
other thing we have a great sponsor in

00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,870
tinkerin i don't think you've probably

00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:08,140
heard of them but there they are a group

00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:10,360
of guys in vancouver who came out of one

00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:12,520
of them the south of vancouver maker

00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,650
groups and started up a 3d printing

00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:17,530
thing and they supplied us with all the

00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:20,230
printers for our maker labs and they

00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:21,670
make just like printers before they can

00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:23,470
make all their money not really off the

00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:26,410
printers but off of selling you the

00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:29,230
resin and the PLA in the plastics but

00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:30,700
that's how we get kids to go all the way

00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:32,680
through this psycho and we teach them

00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:35,320
all these things they don't really

00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,970
understand that they're being you know

00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,280
coerced in the learning new software

00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:41,430
because we've we've gotten them to do it

00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:44,170
interactively and play with it all

00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:46,330
now we're starting to expand the

00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:50,050
curriculum a lot so we got that first

00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:51,640
one worked out and we do that throughout

00:26:50,050 --> 00:26:54,160
the school system and now we're taking

00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,140
minnow boards Intel's mineral boards

00:26:54,160 --> 00:27:00,670
which is sort of like a raspberry pi on

00:26:56,140 --> 00:27:02,590
steroids android i'm not android arduino

00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:06,160
and doing all kinds of little robotic

00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:08,110
workshops too but we really have had a

00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:11,230
huge success with the 3d scanning

00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:13,660
because it has given those kids that

00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:16,750
epiphany moment and so we're always

00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:19,930
looking for those things that they see

00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:22,390
themselves in the tech they learn what's

00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:24,820
the underpinnings of it some of the

00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:27,760
things they do actually learn coding

00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:29,740
because they're modding minecraft they

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,510
see some code in that when they're in

00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:33,550
tinkerin if they want to write a special

00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:35,380
script to do bunny ears or something

00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:38,050
like that they have to go down an alley

00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:41,500
or down a path and see the script and

00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:44,980
modify that so without really forcing

00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:47,880
them they're taking control of the

00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:51,610
agenda and the whole thing around gaming

00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:54,040
which was quite interesting to me is I'm

00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:57,940
not a gamer I the last time I play games

00:27:54,040 --> 00:28:01,180
was ms pacman long time ago and these

00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:04,540
kids downloaded Unreal Engine on one of

00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:06,700
the machines which is now free and they

00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:08,380
started building playing with it

00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:11,680
twiddling around with the things and so

00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:13,690
we ended up having to go and find folks

00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:16,840
from poly count which is the forum for

00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:18,640
Unreal Engine and unity and all kinds of

00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:20,850
other things and they came in they

00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:25,030
sponsored us and they started giving us

00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:28,930
web classes on how to do Unreal Engine

00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:30,850
and and that's where we started playing

00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:33,490
with all of these wonderful first-person

00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:36,520
shooter games and we're not experts by

00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:41,770
any means but I'm really not an expert

00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:43,960
at all because this is this stuff is one

00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:46,780
of one of the things with like I would

00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:50,350
never have come up with shooting gold in

00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:52,750
the statues as a game in action it's

00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:55,030
quite loud and it has paint balls and

00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:57,010
all that but what they're learning is

00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:58,830
they're they're doing some coding inside

00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:00,760
of Unreal Engine they're building

00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:03,340
environments and worlds they're learning

00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:05,350
all the spatial design stuff that you

00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:08,200
know if they're going to be draftsman or

00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:12,160
architects or engineers all of those

00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:15,250
skills are coming in this in this sort

00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:16,600
of backdoor way without me having to say

00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:19,270
ok we're going to sit down and learn

00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:21,760
drafting today we're going to learn what

00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:24,640
a spline is today what a curve is those

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,150
things it all comes in naturally and

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,440
this sort of stuff is what their yeah

00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:31,270
it's the fun stuff I love that this

00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,920
isn't a movie theater because it's the

00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:35,740
first time I've seen it on a huge screen

00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:40,450
like this it's great and I'll yeah

00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:44,800
that's somebody's grandmother there yeah

00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:47,500
oh that's Brian but yeah and this is

00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,810
stuff that you wouldn't think that 10

00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:53,350
year olds and 12 year olds and 14 year

00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:55,360
olds could just take off with and do but

00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:58,660
because we're using these techniques

00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,850
that the teachers are teaching me we are

00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:03,630
getting to do all kinds of new things

00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:07,210
and so the next stage that we're doing

00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:10,450
is really sort of taking apart some of

00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:15,100
those Internet of Things tools and tasks

00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:17,740
if you if you want to teach kids about

00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:19,900
security and privacy you can't say

00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:21,970
you're teaching kids about security and

00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:24,280
privacy on the Internet you have to

00:30:21,970 --> 00:30:26,860
figure out some way to explain to them

00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:30,280
that these things once you take them

00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:33,880
apart are watching you constantly and

00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:35,680
that they play wonderful music but

00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:39,460
they're also trying to get you to buy

00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:42,310
stuff on amazon prime this is the Amazon

00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:45,370
echo which we actually got one of up and

00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:48,490
to take apart and play with and it's

00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:50,500
wonderful it does things like plays all

00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:53,680
the music that they want to hear tells

00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:55,660
them joked has siri-like capabilities

00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,100
called alexa where you can ask it a

00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,960
question it'll tell you the weather in

00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:01,960
Berlin I did that just before I did left

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:05,500
here and it's really a pretty magical

00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:08,300
experience however you can just play use

00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:13,280
it or whoops

00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:15,140
I lost my pictures okay well I lost the

00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:17,600
picture somehow and that thing we

00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:20,180
actually took it apart looked at what

00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,790
was in it under the hood and took a

00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:25,660
suitcase an old leather suitcase put in

00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:28,370
a couple of speakers put in a little

00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:32,120
couple of our dueno boards in it and

00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:33,620
we're running a bluetooth off of that so

00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:36,230
that they could walk by with their

00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:39,650
phones and touch with with their

00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:42,230
androids do NFC or Bluetooth and put

00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:44,780
push whatever song they wanted to from

00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:48,020
their their iphone onto the into the

00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:51,430
suitcase and we've just added in now the

00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:55,640
microphone and we're calling the API for

00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:58,010
the Amazon Alexa API to do the voice

00:31:55,640 --> 00:32:00,140
recognition so they're actually take it

00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:01,370
may not be as compact and beautiful but

00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:05,090
we have a nice little leather suitcase

00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:07,730
and in that we're rebuilding from

00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:10,850
scratch completely open source the the

00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:14,060
IOT device and again that's something

00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:16,850
that I would not have done but the kids

00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:21,140
drove us and move the agenda into that

00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:23,750
space the other thing that there's a lot

00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:25,550
of other projects out there that we're

00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:27,890
connecting with the enable the future

00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:30,820
folks that are doing prosthetic hands

00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:34,820
there's lots of cool stuff around that

00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:38,630
that we've been doing so what our goal

00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:40,970
is is we have the first two of those

00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:43,880
trailers that we've built out and what

00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:46,400
we do is we take those we fill them up

00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:49,070
with all the supplies that we need we

00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:51,860
teach the teachers how to run the

00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:53,480
workshops and then we engage get them to

00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:56,420
engage the cool school or other

00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:59,540
leadership programs and we'll have time

00:32:56,420 --> 00:33:02,000
for Q&A so we teach the teachers that

00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:05,000
and we leave the trailer actually on

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,040
site I go away because I work I have a

00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,070
day job it's not me teaching the classes

00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:12,470
so the goal is not really for me to be

00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:14,150
the one coming and doing a workshop

00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:17,780
though the first year I did a lot of

00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:19,640
them the goal is to have that trailer be

00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:22,050
accessible and be a resource for

00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:25,920
teachers on on campus at this

00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:29,010
goals on First Nations reservations on

00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:31,590
ban land with their school system and

00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:34,860
take it to Maker Faires and do workshops

00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:37,800
there but to be able to take that mobile

00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:40,770
makerspace and leave it behind fully

00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:43,020
stocked and to do that we we do a lot of

00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:45,870
tech events like this to raise money and

00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:47,520
get sponsorship but we're really trying

00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:49,320
to inspire a movement and right now

00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:52,230
there's the two that we have up on the

00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:54,300
coast that were one that's in action and

00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:56,940
one that's being built out and there are

00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:58,500
three of them in Vancouver and so I had

00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:00,600
this vision when I started this whole

00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:02,760
thing you know what a food truck is of

00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:05,400
having food truck rallies but having

00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:07,050
maker truck rallies so that we all bring

00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:10,140
all of our different technologies around

00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:13,800
and have a circle the wagon moment with

00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:16,260
all different tech so what my goal is is

00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:18,120
really not to make you have to come or

00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:20,550
to your kids have to come to a

00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:24,540
makerspace or just have a one day make

00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:26,370
one off maker faire moment but to be

00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:28,140
actually be able to bring these circuses

00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:31,590
to the schools to underserved

00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:33,150
communities across Canada and in where

00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:36,090
we go and we go all the way down to

00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:38,130
portland oregon and washington and

00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:39,810
seattle washington so we go through the

00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:42,090
whole Pacific Northwest my goal is

00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:44,730
really to start to inspire an entire

00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:47,280
movement of mobile maker spaces to take

00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:49,560
and be as resources for teachers and the

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,200
next generation to get that epiphany

00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:54,120
moment going and of course we do a lot

00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,770
of automating of all the workflows and

00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:57,720
if you want to talk to me later about

00:34:55,770 --> 00:35:00,690
Cooper Nettie's or docker or any of that

00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:03,180
fun stuff I'm quite happy to do that but

00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:04,710
really what it is all about it's all

00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:06,330
about the kids we have to thank our

00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:08,370
sponsors because we have lots of them

00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:11,160
there should be one more logo up there

00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:13,260
Microsoft donated a whole whack of Xbox

00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:17,130
connects to us recently so we're very

00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:19,080
grateful for that and with that I'd say

00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:21,540
thank you very much for listening to me

00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:23,190
and our story and hopefully someday

00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:25,650
you'll be inspired to create a mobile

00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:27,780
makerspace or to work within the school

00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:32,580
systems and bring some of these new

00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:33,930
epiphanies to kids elsewhere this is how

00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:35,030
you could reach me this is how you can

00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:36,020
tweet us

00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:38,690
if you're interested in learning more

00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:42,550
and be happy to talk to you all and I'll

00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:42,550
take some questions if people have them

00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:56,900
thank you do I have we have 10 minutes

00:35:53,840 --> 00:36:00,110
for questions so I'm not quite sure okay

00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:06,740
now i have a sound so please raise your

00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:11,030
hands if you have any questions okay

00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:12,680
it's early morning it's 130 a.m. for me

00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:15,680
so I really want to thank you all very

00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:17,630
much I can't see anybody's hands up

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:22,940
because it's we have one question one

00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:26,300
question way up here all right great so

00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:29,140
it I probably all told spent about um I

00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:32,810
would say if I'm really honest about

00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:35,240
seven or eight grand of my own money

00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:38,030
that got put into it probably if I'm

00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:39,950
totally honest a little bit more I'm

00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:43,760
very good at coercing people into doing

00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:47,240
things so the coast makers are there's

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,760
electricians cabinet makers if you work

00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:51,860
with your local makers group if you went

00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,020
to fab lab or said you could find the

00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:57,560
people to help you build it out there's

00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:59,210
um I'm also pretty good at coercing

00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:01,520
sponsors into donating things like

00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:03,740
printers if I had to pay for everything

00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,100
that I did if we probably be around 20

00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:08,900
grand but it wasn't I mean it really is

00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:10,580
a collaborative effort and I think

00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:13,130
that's the thing and once you get into

00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:17,810
the school systems then it makes it even

00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:19,130
easier um there's another question here

00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:24,620
and the microphone is actually right

00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:26,960
behind you that's quite easy I was

00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:29,270
wondering this seems like a really

00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,750
bottom-up approach so you try to reach

00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:36,050
the kids using your Caravan like we say

00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:40,010
here in Europe I was wondering did you

00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:42,220
try to try a more top-down reach into

00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:44,990
the education system and try to

00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:48,080
establish something there it's it's a

00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:52,640
very good question so

00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:55,670
we on the coast where we are I started

00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:57,440
go I I did this I did an earlier

00:37:55,670 --> 00:38:00,110
iteration of this which was called

00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:02,300
discover totems because there are so

00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:05,330
many First Nations folks I was trying to

00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:07,610
teach tech that way and so I would go

00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:10,610
and I would be the one person that would

00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:13,220
go and deliver a course and get approved

00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:14,990
by the teachers and the curriculum to

00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:19,460
teach this one course and it just didn't

00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:21,410
scale so what we don't scale I'm not

00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:27,560
multi-tenant and I on camp you can't put

00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:29,390
me in a container so so we did and and

00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:33,170
but I wasn't leaving behind enough

00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:36,020
skills so the the next the next

00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:37,970
iteration of that I decided to get out

00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:40,520
step outside of it and not make it about

00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:42,470
me and work with a whole bunch of

00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,360
collaborators and in those collaborators

00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:47,330
are the principles from some of the cool

00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:49,360
the school systems on the sunshine coast

00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:52,400
and the first year was really about

00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:55,040
developing a curriculum that people

00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:56,390
would have epiphany moments and trying

00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,800
to figure out what that is and get

00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:00,410
sponsors and build the whole thing up

00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:03,370
and almost immediately as soon as we had

00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:06,050
something real like it wasn't just talk

00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:08,330
the school systems just invited us in

00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:09,860
and so now we are working in

00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:12,860
collaboration with the local school

00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:15,140
systems for BC and hopefully spreading

00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:19,270
it all across British Columbia and

00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:22,820
Canada but this this model scales

00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:24,740
because it's not about individual people

00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:26,690
doing it you can build out a trailer you

00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:28,070
can train teachers you can train you

00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:29,870
know the older students to teach the

00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:31,730
courses and that's really the difference

00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:34,270
I think then just coming in and doing

00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:37,340
yeah look at me i have on my cool tech

00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:43,070
for one day that's not replacing the

00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:45,350
powerpoint issue so thank you any other

00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:47,590
question yeah please come to the

00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:47,590
microphone

00:39:50,529 --> 00:39:56,720
there's a very bright spotlights okay so

00:39:54,319 --> 00:40:00,190
you're working on this full time no I am

00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:02,510
NOT i'm working for red hat full-time

00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:05,779
this is something because i have

00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:09,440
collaborators there's one other person

00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:12,170
on the coast who's a full-time person

00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:15,440
working on it at the moment there are

00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:17,420
about six kids that are trained now that

00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,240
can do the stuff on the inside of the

00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:22,640
trailer and we're working over the

00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:24,980
summer with the teachers so there there

00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:27,529
is no full-time employee this is all

00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:30,260
that group of coast makers that you saw

00:40:27,529 --> 00:40:32,089
that kind of ragtag band of folks those

00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:33,650
are the people that are keeping the

00:40:32,089 --> 00:40:35,799
trail building the trailers and keeping

00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:37,730
them up it's a big collaboration

00:40:35,799 --> 00:40:39,170
otherwise you get them and you get the

00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:40,880
kids to do it themselves that's what you

00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:43,069
do you recruit the kids you recruit the

00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,569
kids and it's really easy to do you know

00:40:43,069 --> 00:40:47,059
once you get it in there if you figure

00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:49,430
out the right sort of thing to do you

00:40:47,059 --> 00:40:51,799
know you're not like teak saying you

00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:53,660
will learn Unreal Engine you know you

00:40:51,799 --> 00:40:57,140
will do well I'm going to have to learn

00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:58,880
now next on the occultists rift the VR

00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,529
stuff because that's the next thing they

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,319
decided they wanted to learn so the next

00:41:00,529 --> 00:41:07,250
trailer is a VR trailer and all of that

00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:10,250
stuff is coming in July so the person

00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:13,039
who only knows pac-man is going to do VR

00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:15,259
this summer and so I get a lot out of it

00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:18,109
too so I learn all this new tech but

00:41:15,259 --> 00:41:20,569
it's it's by no means a full-time job

00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:23,690
how does the gender balance ago as the

00:41:20,569 --> 00:41:27,710
kids go over as at you have to make a

00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:31,279
concerted effort to get the girls

00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:34,339
involved the gender balance in the

00:41:31,279 --> 00:41:38,349
younger ages just doing the 3d so it's

00:41:34,339 --> 00:41:40,460
it 5050 there's no imbalance it's um

00:41:38,349 --> 00:41:43,579
trying to get them in the leadership

00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:47,029
roles is you have takes takes in it

00:41:43,579 --> 00:41:49,519
takes effort and takes attention so my

00:41:47,029 --> 00:41:51,380
goal the first year the first Maker

00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:55,609
Faires that we did I ran the workshops

00:41:51,380 --> 00:42:00,200
this past one the entire trailer was set

00:41:55,609 --> 00:42:02,000
up and run by 3 14 year old boys and my

00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:04,069
goal next year is that the whole thing

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,249
is run by girls

00:42:04,069 --> 00:42:12,829
so it's it definitely takes a concerted

00:42:07,249 --> 00:42:17,209
effort we have time for a very short

00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:19,479
question so yeah please come to the

00:42:17,209 --> 00:42:19,479
microphone

00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:35,099
hi I want to do you know coderdojo from

00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:37,019
Ireland the movement yeah I've seen yeah

00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:39,959
maybe it could combine somehow I don't

00:42:37,019 --> 00:42:42,299
know yes so we do so we have on the

00:42:39,959 --> 00:42:44,699
coast like I said we sort of the

00:42:42,299 --> 00:42:46,709
fastest-growing maker community in all

00:42:44,699 --> 00:42:49,259
of Canada it's happening right now and

00:42:46,709 --> 00:42:52,099
we have folks that do scratch and all

00:42:49,259 --> 00:42:55,709
sorts of other teaching coding stuff so

00:42:52,099 --> 00:42:58,160
what I've focused on is what I knew you

00:42:55,709 --> 00:43:00,989
know the 3d design and the spatial stuff

00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:03,479
but we have other curriculums that are

00:43:00,989 --> 00:43:05,489
coming in to teach teach that and it is

00:43:03,479 --> 00:43:08,369
we learn from all the other the dojo

00:43:05,489 --> 00:43:10,469
from PI ladies from girls that code all

00:43:08,369 --> 00:43:12,989
kinds of great organizations out there

00:43:10,469 --> 00:43:16,410
that enable the futures is another one

00:43:12,989 --> 00:43:19,140
that you know we had 3d printers redhead

00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:21,420
a relationship with them I met them all

00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:23,519
at Red Hat some it's an amazing network

00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:27,359
of people out there doing this kind of

00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:30,239
stuff the key is to figure out a model

00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:32,400
that's repeatable and scalable that you

00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:34,829
can keep bringing back because there's a

00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,289
lot of burnout in this kind of stuff so

00:43:34,829 --> 00:43:40,799
when you create this there's a sort of

00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:43,739
an arc for maker spaces they'll get

00:43:40,799 --> 00:43:47,009
total enthusiasm donations find the

00:43:43,739 --> 00:43:48,900
space build a space and for the first

00:43:47,009 --> 00:43:51,709
two or three years they'll have great

00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:54,119
you know great number of people

00:43:51,709 --> 00:43:56,759
participating using the space using and

00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:58,979
as the volunteer board gets tired of

00:43:56,759 --> 00:44:01,589
being the volunteer board they kind of

00:43:58,979 --> 00:44:05,539
arc and Wayne so we've seen a bit of

00:44:01,589 --> 00:44:08,009
that so it's we're trying really hard to

00:44:05,539 --> 00:44:10,349
scale the model get incorporated into

00:44:08,009 --> 00:44:14,999
the school systems and work work in

00:44:10,349 --> 00:44:17,279
tandem so this I think that's the end of

00:44:14,999 --> 00:44:18,989
my time I really want to thank you for

00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:21,239
having me come to Berlin I get a chance

00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:23,549
to see some of the maker spaces here and

00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:25,920
to meet all of you and I'll be around

00:44:23,549 --> 00:44:29,549
afterwards drinking more coffee because

00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:31,259
it is 130 a.m. and i'll be outside and

00:44:29,549 --> 00:44:32,780
you can ask any more questions so thank

00:44:31,259 --> 00:44:34,840
you very much

00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,840
