hello everyone welcome to this speech so

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:58,200
I think you will be interested in this

00:02:54,349 --> 00:03:02,280
argument and you will enjoy is our

00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:05,190
reason so I leave the world to the

00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,810
speaker and if you have any question you

00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:26,819
will be the guy let's have an answer

00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:29,849
today Thanks hello everyone so how many

00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:31,380
people here have worked on projects

00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:33,000
where they're not it's not just an

00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,380
internal project but there's a product

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,370
that other people are going to use

00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:40,620
outside of your company okay how many

00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:45,330
people have worked on just internal

00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:47,160
projects okay a few how many people had

00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:51,750
a product manager that you had to work

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:53,640
with okay how many people thought that

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:57,060
that product manager made the right

00:03:53,640 --> 00:04:01,100
decision every single time there are no

00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:04,170
hands zero hands excellent

00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:11,160
so here's a little background I am a

00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:13,079
developer I worked on turbo gears I did

00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:15,120
a bunch of web development for a bunch

00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,760
of different products I ended up at

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,160
SourceForge I was a developer there I

00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:25,650
helped rewrite a bunch of things and

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:28,110
then there was a No all of our product

00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:29,580
management team got laid off at the same

00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,460
time and there was a bunch of job

00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,710
openings and I was like you know what

00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,440
really isn't working product management

00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:38,940
I should probably help with that because

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,780
then maybe we would spend less time

00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:44,690
building stupid stuff that nobody wants

00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:47,130
so I became product manager for a while

00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:49,740
then I became director of engineering I

00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:52,800
did this and then the other but so I

00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:56,930
have feet in both product management and

00:04:52,800 --> 00:05:00,150
development worlds so this

00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:04,189
be about those feel free if there are

00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:07,550
any questions at any time to let me know

00:05:04,189 --> 00:05:09,780
the first thing that I will say about

00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:12,509
improving product management or doing

00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:16,050
experimental project product development

00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:19,439
is that if you have tests then you are

00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:23,430
making progress how many people here

00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:26,280
developed like before they wrote at work

00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:28,909
on big code bases with no tests before

00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:33,270
test-driven development was that awesome

00:05:28,909 --> 00:05:36,449
no and that is where product management

00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:39,719
is today like most people are like hey

00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:41,729
people will want X and so they give them

00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:43,379
ax they don't test anything they don't

00:05:41,729 --> 00:05:47,759
know what these ideas good or bad they

00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:49,770
got no idea so if you wanted to make

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,779
product development more scientific what

00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:55,949
would we do so how does science work

00:05:53,779 --> 00:05:58,039
anybody want to tell me how science

00:05:55,949 --> 00:05:58,039
works

00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:08,759
this guy over here is gonna tell us how

00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:10,560
science works right check like you go

00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:13,710
over them so I'll give you a slightly

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,210
more detailed you ask a question you do

00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,250
some background research you figure out

00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:19,800
like is this a stupid question like has

00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:21,839
it already been answered you construct

00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,060
some sort of hypothesis you figure out a

00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:26,460
way to test your hypothesis by doing

00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:29,520
some sort of experiment you analyze your

00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:31,409
data and you're like hey you draw a

00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,629
conclusion like my hypothesis was

00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:35,759
correct or incorrect your poor your

00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:37,289
results this is kind of an

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,060
oversimplification we're gonna get into

00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:42,240
why this is crazy and nobody actually

00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:45,870
does this hopefully at the end of this

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,449
talk but this is the basic mechanism of

00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:50,069
science right you ask a question and

00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:56,250
palette managers do this all the time

00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:58,529
they're like would people buy X and then

00:06:56,250 --> 00:07:00,509
they do background research is like what

00:06:58,529 --> 00:07:02,939
they actually know how to do they write

00:07:00,509 --> 00:07:04,680
market requirement documents and product

00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:09,120
requirement documents and all kinds of

00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:11,520
documents and then they think

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,180
they skipped this whole part they like

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,680
ha I did some research we're good and

00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:20,729
then they might come down to here and

00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:23,310
report your results be like yes everyone

00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:29,370
loves the iPad or no no one loves the

00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:31,110
iPad so if you have a contest between

00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:33,780
people doing a bunch of market research

00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:36,229
and people just spewing total

00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,229
who wins

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,650
anybody got another question the answer

00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:47,220
is everybody loses

00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:52,410
bathtime it's a bad idea let's not do

00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:54,539
that so like for instance so George when

00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:56,550
I first started at SourceForge we just

00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:59,880
redesigned the project summary page to

00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:01,800
look like this and it was nicer than

00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,660
what was before it had this big green

00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,990
button people could figure out what file

00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:08,669
to download people liked it but we

00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:11,970
didn't actually like I did the

00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:14,520
engineering work we made this page it

00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:21,510
worked we changed it again to something

00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:23,990
completely different the product manager

00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:30,060
at the time was like hey this is better

00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:32,159
we're like ok and then after I became

00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:36,240
product manager we redesigned it to look

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:38,459
like this now this I can tell you is

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,010
better now how do I know that this is

00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:44,580
better than this and then the one that

00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:47,520
came before it because I did test so

00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:50,070
this more people finds the download that

00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,350
they are looking for on this page they

00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:55,380
see the screenshots like they understand

00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:58,020
so we did tests we did usability tests

00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:02,100
there's a website called user research

00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:03,720
com you just give people a URL and you

00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,910
tell them to run through a script and

00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,310
they talk about what they're seeing and

00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:11,490
thinking as they do it this is a very

00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:14,010
low cost test I mean you have to have at

00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:16,440
the page written but you only have to

00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,570
make one page you don't have to make

00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,950
your whole site do that and you just

00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,300
have a couple of people go through it

00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,499
over and evening and then you watch the

00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,849
video and

00:09:22,499 --> 00:09:26,129
almost always when you look at a

00:09:23,849 --> 00:09:30,799
usability test like that you'll find

00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:33,749
some interesting results actually like

00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:37,679
I've cut I've trimmed this there are

00:09:33,749 --> 00:09:39,169
some ads over here this is and also over

00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:43,859
here

00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:46,439
but in SourceForge you have this page

00:09:43,859 --> 00:09:49,019
and then we did this foot redesign first

00:09:46,439 --> 00:09:53,459
we actually put the download button way

00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:56,399
over next to the ads at the top in the

00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:59,549
same place that the Amazon like

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,439
one-click buy this thing is can we

00:09:59,549 --> 00:10:03,509
figured people know how Amazon works

00:10:01,439 --> 00:10:04,979
like if you put in the same place as

00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:07,739
Amazon people will probably figure out

00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:09,629
where to click it um but there were ads

00:10:07,739 --> 00:10:11,159
next to it and then it's this green

00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:13,109
button and they looked at it and they

00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:17,069
thought it was an ad like nobody could

00:10:13,109 --> 00:10:18,689
see it so that nice results when they

00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:21,149
first launched this were way worse than

00:10:18,689 --> 00:10:23,489
the preceding page so we did the user

00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:25,379
tests when we had some users walk

00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:27,839
through it and then immediately it was

00:10:25,379 --> 00:10:30,659
obvious why the click-through rate went

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,359
down so we fixed it we did another

00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:37,139
redesign we tested this so we know that

00:10:33,359 --> 00:10:39,149
this one is better not because some

00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:41,220
designer says so or because some product

00:10:39,149 --> 00:10:46,709
manager says so but because the data

00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:52,769
says so so what kind of things can we

00:10:46,709 --> 00:10:54,779
test if we want to make better products

00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:56,459
and this is totally taken from the slide

00:10:54,779 --> 00:11:00,179
show called metrics for pirates I

00:10:56,459 --> 00:11:02,069
totally ripped this guy's thing off and

00:11:00,179 --> 00:11:08,879
they've got a nice acronym can everyone

00:11:02,069 --> 00:11:11,389
say this acronym so now you know you can

00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:13,589
just if you remember ah you can remember

00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:17,309
acquisition activation or attention and

00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:19,979
referral and if you get these things

00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:22,499
right if all of these things are working

00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:25,259
your product will continue to get new

00:11:22,499 --> 00:11:27,359
users they'll stay on your site there

00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:32,849
were four other people and you will get

00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:34,690
revenue which sounds good so if you have

00:11:32,849 --> 00:11:36,819
an existing product

00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:38,889
let's talk through these things let's

00:11:36,819 --> 00:11:42,209
talk about activation so you have a

00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:45,370
whole it should be acquisition first

00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:48,819
yeah this just says activation but it is

00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:50,939
acquisition so you have this whole bunch

00:11:48,819 --> 00:11:55,420
of channels search engine marketing SEO

00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:57,100
product relations campaigns and contests

00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:01,029
and affiliate links on other people's

00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:03,189
websites and television and blogs and

00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:07,240
whatever kind of way you get people to

00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:09,009
notice that your product exists they

00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:10,540
come in they come in through some home

00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:12,970
page or some landing page that you've

00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:15,550
designed for them maybe there's a

00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:19,779
product features page and like they come

00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:21,399
in and you can figure out if you do some

00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:23,829
testing and you do some research or

00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:25,120
channels are people actually using to

00:12:23,829 --> 00:12:27,399
get to your website which of these

00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,000
things are working how much money is it

00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:32,439
costing you for each of these things

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,079
what is the cost per visitor for each

00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:37,060
channel what channels drive engagement

00:12:35,079 --> 00:12:38,889
so what channels have people that show

00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:40,300
up and then leave what channels have

00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:44,199
people that show up and then look at

00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:46,269
more than one page and you may want to

00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:49,750
invest more in channels that have higher

00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:51,850
engagement even if there's a higher cost

00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:55,810
per visitor you're going to have to look

00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:58,779
at the other metrics so this is just a

00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:01,779
symbol and you use Google Analytics and

00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:03,939
I would have some sample code that

00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:06,459
Python code that uses the Google

00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:08,800
Analytics API to grab stuff out so that

00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:13,660
you can look at these questions but I

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:17,230
didn't get all of that cleared by my

00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:19,750
former employer so those things are not

00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:22,449
here but it's easy like the Google API

00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:24,819
is totally trivial this isn't like you

00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:27,519
look at the Google API website you can

00:13:24,819 --> 00:13:29,199
figure out how to pull data out you

00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,699
didn't even have for this kind of stuff

00:13:29,199 --> 00:13:32,829
you don't even have to pull data out you

00:13:30,699 --> 00:13:34,709
can use the Google Analytics it has

00:13:32,829 --> 00:13:36,879
charts you can figure it out from here

00:13:34,709 --> 00:13:38,500
but later you're gonna want to take that

00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,569
data and associate it with other data

00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,920
that you have so it's always nice to be

00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:45,269
able to pull it out and put it in a

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,269
database that you own

00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:53,040
so in activation you have to decide what

00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:55,679
activation means for you now in all of

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,299
these examples I am talking about web

00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:58,559
stuff as though we all do web

00:13:57,299 --> 00:14:00,329
development and it's the only thing that

00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:01,819
ever happens and the only thing that

00:14:00,329 --> 00:14:04,889
people care about is web sites that

00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:06,600
might not be true but I'm going to

00:14:04,889 --> 00:14:09,929
pretend it's true and make you guys do

00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,730
translation - you know something else if

00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:13,910
it's not on the web I don't know what

00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:20,129
that is

00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:21,720
so anyway you another tool that I will

00:14:20,129 --> 00:14:23,489
recommend here is Google Website

00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:27,600
optimizer Google Website optimizer

00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:30,689
basically lets you do two different

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:36,689
versions of a page and test which one

00:14:30,689 --> 00:14:38,249
works better and one trick that would be

00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:40,519
in the code that I would show you if I

00:14:38,249 --> 00:14:45,929
could show you code is that you should

00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:49,199
in your Google Website optimizer setup

00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:51,329
it's gonna put a cookie that says we'll

00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,669
be in a test group and which test group

00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:56,759
you're in that information is not

00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:58,579
available in Google Analytics but you

00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:02,989
have custom fields in Google Analytics

00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:09,919
so in your GA code you should copy the

00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:13,019
test version that you're in into GA user

00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:16,499
defined fields so that you can then sort

00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:18,509
and segment out just users who are in a

00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:23,939
certain test to see if they had a

00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:25,709
different well for activation you're

00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:31,619
gonna get the results that you need from

00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:32,790
gwo directly but for other things that

00:15:31,619 --> 00:15:35,220
we're going to talk about later like

00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:37,439
retention and whatnot you're gonna want

00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:40,079
to look be able to match up what test

00:15:37,439 --> 00:15:47,639
group you're in with other data from GA

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:50,549
later so then you can run tests what is

00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:52,279
your activation rate per channel once

00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:54,660
you've defined what activation means

00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:55,889
maybe it's signing up maybe it's just

00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,730
hanging out on the page for a certain

00:15:55,889 --> 00:16:01,870
amount of time maybe it's

00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:04,360
I mean it depends on your product and

00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:06,760
then can you optimize activation you run

00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:10,120
lots and lots of a/b tests you say hey

00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:12,670
and then stupid a B test you say this

00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:15,070
could never possibly be better this

00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:16,089
looks horrible and ugly this landing

00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:18,990
page is stupid

00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:21,699
this content nobody will like it try it

00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:23,560
what's it gonna hurt you run a few

00:16:21,699 --> 00:16:29,740
people through it turns out you will

00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:31,750
learn a lot and then you can also once

00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,339
you've got some basic understanding of

00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:35,320
what works and doesn't work for your

00:16:33,339 --> 00:16:37,540
users so you can look at four different

00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,550
channels do different landing pages work

00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:43,589
better so for people who are coming in

00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:45,940
from Twitter is it okay do they care

00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:48,730
about a different landing page maybe

00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:50,980
they are more likely to read really

00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:56,350
wrong amounts of text or maybe they're

00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:58,149
less I mean their Twitter users so you

00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,290
might need to get up your whole pitch

00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:04,540
for your product in two hundred and

00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:07,150
forty characters so once you've got like

00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:08,799
some understanding of the channels that

00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:13,270
you're using to get users and how you

00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:14,860
activate those users and then once

00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:16,630
they're activated you want to know are

00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:19,209
we keeping the users around are there

00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:22,179
things we can do to keep users around

00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:23,890
like I have one bullet that is actually

00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:26,890
the most important thing all this other

00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:28,510
stuff like it's useful but if you don't

00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:30,429
have features that people care about if

00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:32,350
they're not coming back because they

00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:36,010
want to be on your site for some reason

00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:37,630
then like sending emails when they

00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:39,640
signed up or when they've been around

00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:42,660
for 30 days none of that is going to

00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:47,200
work unless you have compelling features

00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:49,750
the tool that I'm adding here is cohort

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:55,299
analysis and this is not only a tool

00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:58,809
it's a technique and cohort analysis is

00:17:55,299 --> 00:18:01,570
just a technique of taking all of the

00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:04,600
users who signed up in a specific period

00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:06,970
of time or who have access to a specific

00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,150
set of features if you're running to

00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:10,840
sort of parallel tests at the same time

00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:13,360
and

00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:15,280
comparing them with people who came in

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,680
earlier or who don't have access to

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,680
those features so you take your cohort

00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:23,710
any test like these people who have

00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:29,350
access to say your github and you just

00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:30,820
released the merge request feature and

00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:32,680
you're like people who have merged

00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,480
requests did they use the site more

00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:37,480
often than people who do not have merge

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,860
requests is their retention better than

00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,260
people who don't

00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:44,410
this is how you tell our new features

00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:46,960
actually mattering to users do they

00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:50,530
stick around retention is super super

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,690
key to understanding are the features

00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:59,350
that you are putting out there making a

00:18:52,690 --> 00:19:01,990
difference the next set of analytics

00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:04,120
stuff to look at is referrals this is

00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:06,880
very important because most of your

00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:11,170
users come from other users liking your

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:13,090
site and there's this term called Net

00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:15,010
Promoter Score which just means how

00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:18,700
likely are you to refer other people to

00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:20,710
use this site and it's really just when

00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:23,140
you ask people are they likely to refer

00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:25,900
people what do they say not do they

00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:29,710
actually refer people but it's a

00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:31,420
reasonably good approximation of do

00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,500
people actually like your site like

00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:36,370
they're not going to tell their friends

00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:39,130
about your site if it's awful they're

00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:41,590
not going to make themselves look bad by

00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:43,630
recommending so if you have

00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:46,120
then this will tell you that you have

00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:47,440
 and this is important because you

00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:52,810
should I figure that out and do

00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:55,120
something else and then you can also

00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:57,850
look back to previous things like what

00:19:55,120 --> 00:20:00,490
channels of people who came in are more

00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:03,100
likely to create refers like the people

00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,660
who came in from SEO will for my product

00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:06,790
more often than people who came in from

00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:09,400
Twitter probably it's the opposite and

00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:11,920
so you may find that even though there

00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,050
are less people coming in from Twitter

00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,460
it is worth investing in the Twitter

00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:17,260
people because they will then later

00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:21,210
refer you to their friends on Twitter

00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:24,470
and you will get more total new users

00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:31,120
from a Twitter user than you do

00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:33,590
a search engine a search ad or something

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,690
and then can you provide some tools that

00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:37,789
help referral effectiveness and whatnot

00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:39,049
measure all this stuff once you put out

00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:39,620
the tool measure doesn't make a

00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:42,049
difference

00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:43,429
use cohort analysis because you're

00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:45,770
probably not going to want your site to

00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:48,380
stay static the whole time so you put

00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:50,990
out a new tool and say do all referrals

00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:54,620
from people who came in after I added

00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:56,059
this tool go up you got to use cohort

00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:59,120
analysis because once you add a new

00:20:56,059 --> 00:21:02,059
feature like your total retention

00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,039
numbers may not go up or down at all but

00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:06,679
if you look at new users from that time

00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:09,440
period you will see what's happening and

00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:12,169
you will see whether users those new

00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,630
users who see that feature at when they

00:21:12,169 --> 00:21:16,130
first sign up are more excited or less

00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:17,780
excited course people who've been around

00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:19,549
forever they may not change their

00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:24,380
behavior at all even when you add new

00:21:19,549 --> 00:21:27,289
features and then revenue is very

00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:29,419
specific like are you what kind of site

00:21:27,289 --> 00:21:31,539
are you do you have ads do you ask

00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:34,909
people to sign up and charge the money

00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:37,309
it's very hard to give like a specific

00:21:34,909 --> 00:21:42,380
set of things to test but you should be

00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:44,809
testing with revenue and you gotta have

00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:47,450
particularly like there's some sort of

00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:49,610
call to action it might just be ads you

00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:51,620
gotta multi-variant tests like where do

00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:54,289
I put the ads on my site to get more

00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:55,850
click-through there's trade-offs with

00:21:54,289 --> 00:21:58,000
things like that it's like you want

00:21:55,850 --> 00:22:00,169
people to do things on your site

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,070
advertisers want you to leave your site

00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:06,590
and go and buy their so you have to

00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:08,720
like measure those two things and make

00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:11,210
the trade-offs and measure what those

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:19,059
trade-offs mean if you can't do it then

00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:22,190
you're just making random decisions so

00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:24,530
all of that sort of assumes that you

00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:28,000
have an existing product that you know

00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:33,140
how to sell and you know will work so

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,549
that is not necessarily true if you come

00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,919
up

00:22:33,549 --> 00:22:38,049
with a new idea or your startup you

00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,970
might be asking like can I sell shoes on

00:22:38,049 --> 00:22:41,830
the internet like will that work well

00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:43,749
people buy shoes on the Internet

00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:47,889
like this is a real question before

00:22:43,749 --> 00:22:50,320
Zappos like a lot of people would have

00:22:47,889 --> 00:22:52,480
told you no they would never if you

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,809
asked people would you buy shoes on the

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,960
Internet people will say no I have to

00:22:55,809 --> 00:23:01,989
know whether they will fit like seems

00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:08,350
reasonable turns out people buy a lot of

00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:11,279
shoes on the Internet who knows so this

00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:14,470
is the traditional okay so all that

00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:17,619
we've gone through a sort of preface to

00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:20,049
how many people want to start brand new

00:23:17,619 --> 00:23:22,480
products that are different than what

00:23:20,049 --> 00:23:25,179
they're doing now or that don't have

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:30,519
lots of users or a working business

00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:33,100
model okay so how do you build a great

00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:35,679
product like the traditional way they

00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:37,869
call it product management and the thing

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,190
you do is you start with a great idea

00:23:37,869 --> 00:23:39,909
you're like you know what is gonna be

00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:46,210
great

00:23:39,909 --> 00:23:48,309
shoes on the Internet seems crazy also

00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:50,080
pet food on the internet like people

00:23:48,309 --> 00:23:52,179
came up with these ideas it was just

00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,690
like you take something and you add on

00:23:52,179 --> 00:23:54,690
the Internet

00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,909
now you have a great idea let's build a

00:23:58,239 --> 00:24:05,940
side in fermentation and usually like

00:24:00,909 --> 00:24:05,940
they didn't fail here like pets calm

00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:11,169
they built a site it worked

00:24:09,129 --> 00:24:14,379
you could buy stuff you could get dog

00:24:11,169 --> 00:24:16,679
food shipped to you nobody bought dog

00:24:14,379 --> 00:24:19,659
food on the Internet

00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:22,119
so then they launched they had a lot of

00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:26,039
marketing they had like TV ads they had

00:24:22,119 --> 00:24:30,940
deals of cash right did they win no

00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:33,759
total fail because when where did they

00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:35,710
feel like they got the execution right

00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:41,529
they launched they had really good

00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:45,179
marketing like they didn't have as an

00:24:41,529 --> 00:24:45,179
idea that was as great as their thoughts

00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:54,059
so stirrups are totally different than

00:24:49,139 --> 00:24:56,750
real companies this may not seem like a

00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:59,750
shock but startups don't have customers

00:24:56,750 --> 00:25:02,220
services don't have a business plan or

00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:04,049
they they have a business plan but they

00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:05,370
have okay and you're dealing with a

00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:08,130
business plan they don't have a business

00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:10,080
model that works we have a made-up thing

00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:12,299
that they wrote down and hand it to some

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,429
VC guy and they gave him some money or

00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:20,070
they for self under there however they

00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:22,230
did it and there's like an analogy of

00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:23,100
this back to science because I like to

00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:27,299
go back to science

00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:28,950
I read a book a long time ago the

00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:31,820
structure of scientific revolutions

00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:35,100
does anyone else read this book okay and

00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:40,139
has everyone has anyone else heard the

00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:43,440
phrase paradigm shift okay that phrase

00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:47,149
comes from this book is massively abused

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:50,210
by marketing droids for like 30 years

00:25:47,149 --> 00:25:54,690
but this book is actually very very good

00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:57,539
and this book is sort of research into

00:25:54,690 --> 00:26:00,929
the history of science and what happens

00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:04,380
when scientific events like the switch

00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:06,600
from Newtonian understanding of physics

00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:08,639
to an Einsteinian understanding of

00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:11,789
physics happen like what happens there

00:26:08,639 --> 00:26:13,260
like it's not just hey I'm gonna shift

00:26:11,789 --> 00:26:14,970
things around a little bit

00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:18,059
suddenly we think about the world

00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:22,380
entirely differently but gravity is not

00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:23,960
what it was before gravity is a

00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:27,210
completely different thing

00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:30,720
prions sine and cosine sine and he calls

00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:32,850
those things scientific revolutions and

00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,090
he calls the things that happen in

00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:38,940
between scientific revolutions normal

00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:42,889
science and that is very much like

00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:45,539
regular companies versus startups now

00:26:42,889 --> 00:26:50,760
regular companies can do revolutions to

00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:55,080
not button down HP or maybe I am I don't

00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:56,230
know historically they did better than

00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:01,440
recently any

00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:03,940
way so you have natural science versus

00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,740
revolutions and revolutions only have

00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:08,260
these big shifts in the way that people

00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:13,809
think about some specific part of

00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:17,110
scientific understanding and then you

00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:18,940
have in sort of regular companies you

00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:21,669
have optimization of your product and

00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:24,309
insert ups you have discovery of a new

00:27:21,669 --> 00:27:27,610
product you're trying to find create a

00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:30,520
new product find a business model get

00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:32,559
customers figure out how to market it

00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:35,440
all at once like you have so many

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:37,450
unknowns and people usually start out by

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,179
assuming that they know how to sell it

00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:42,700
they know we were wanted by it they know

00:27:40,179 --> 00:27:47,860
how much they want to buy and really the

00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:53,169
only unknown is can we build it this guy

00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:56,280
Steve Blank wrote a book in maybe ten

00:27:53,169 --> 00:28:00,190
years ago called customer development

00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:02,140
this book is very very important in

00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:04,929
product management to thinking these

00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:09,220
days and it's called customer

00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:12,160
development not product development and

00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:14,650
basically he advocates that instead of

00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:17,230
trying to develop products you should

00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:20,290
try to develop customers you should find

00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:22,660
people who have a problem you should

00:28:20,290 --> 00:28:25,179
discover your customers find some

00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:28,540
customers who have a problem that they

00:28:25,179 --> 00:28:31,330
are willing to pay to have solved when

00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:34,030
you have found customers then you build

00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:35,919
something and then you're like hey give

00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:37,690
me money to solve them give me money and

00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:41,590
your problem will be solved I have the

00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:42,880
thing and then they're like no and then

00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:45,070
you're like oh you're not really

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,410
customers and now you're back here and

00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:49,720
you keep doing this until you find

00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:51,970
people who will buy something if you do

00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:55,059
this before you spend a million hours

00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:55,960
building something suddenly you're like

00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:59,890
haha

00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:03,920
I didn't say million dollars on pets

00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:07,640
calm and

00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:10,790
Zappos a hedge apples up here before who

00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:12,230
knows how Zappos got started anyone okay

00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:14,300
there's someone so I'm telling the story

00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:16,700
to a couple of people but the first

00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:19,550
thing they did was they went to shoe

00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:21,710
stores and took pictures of shoes and

00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:24,530
then they put them on the Internet

00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:26,990
and said hey you can buy these shoes and

00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:28,790
then when people would click on there

00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:31,160
and buy the shoes they would go to the

00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:33,250
shoe store and they would buy the shoes

00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:35,690
and they would ship them to you

00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:38,240
they had no warehouse they have no

00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:39,920
company that's a guy who like ran around

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:44,050
buying shoes would enough people click

00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:46,940
things on the internet but guess what

00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:47,420
turns out people will buy shoes on the

00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:51,470
Internet

00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:56,780
pet food no shoes yes people weird who

00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:58,670
knows so then they like all right now we

00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:00,590
can build a website and how we can build

00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:02,810
this thing up because they found

00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:04,460
customers they validated that they would

00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:06,260
buy shoes and they did it in the

00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:09,350
cheapest possible way they didn't do

00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:10,760
anything crazy they diminish the

00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:12,740
smallest amount of infrastructure they

00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:16,730
possibly could a guy running around New

00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:20,270
York City buying shoes and they even

00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:22,580
like the news so that people even have a

00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:26,270
phrase for that they call it concierge

00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:28,190
product which is you build a website and

00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:30,440
when people click thing somebody

00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:32,000
actually goes and does the thing but you

00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,120
don't have to actually build the thing

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,740
that does the thing you just have a guy

00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:39,260
who does the thing when people click the

00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:42,380
button like and it's not a bad idea

00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:44,810
because then you know like when that guy

00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:46,670
is too busy to keep doing it you know

00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:48,620
you better automate that thing like

00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:56,990
there are customers they care

00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:59,930
like now automate it so okay 17 minutes

00:30:56,990 --> 00:31:05,210
I'm going to tell another quick story

00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:06,530
about there's another guy Eric Ries who

00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:09,590
wrote a book called the Lean Startup

00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:12,230
which is also very useful I highly

00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:12,820
recommend this book and his company this

00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:17,409
is the

00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:19,720
they showed their feces when they

00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:21,610
started and somewhere along here they

00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:26,769
launched their product which was like a

00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:28,210
3d chat program and it turns out like

00:31:26,769 --> 00:31:30,519
nobody really wanted to use their

00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:33,220
product so like lines going down like

00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:38,110
they spend money to get people to sign

00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:40,419
up and then they've all quit the what

00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:41,830
they found out is like this area is 3d

00:31:40,419 --> 00:31:45,399
chat there was an add-on to your

00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:49,029
existing chat program so you'd have aim

00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:51,580
or whatever and it onto your existing

00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:55,090
chat will never give you 3d capability

00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:56,889
also so you take your you'd be able to

00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:59,169
chat with people who don't have this and

00:31:56,889 --> 00:32:01,210
then you'd be able to chat with your

00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:04,330
friends who have it but now have a 3d

00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:06,909
avatar turned out their customers like

00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:10,149
why would I want to do that that seems

00:32:06,909 --> 00:32:12,190
stupid but they're like if you don't

00:32:10,149 --> 00:32:15,460
have friends who already use this system

00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:17,350
it's worthless like it seems logical so

00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:19,600
they built a thing that connected to

00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:22,210
your existing network didn't work at all

00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,860
maybe like well we don't want our

00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:28,750
friends to know about it what if it's

00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:31,750
stupid and so eventually they're like

00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:34,809
alright and so somewhere around here

00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:37,149
they said all right we get it

00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:40,570
we're gonna make a standalone network

00:32:37,149 --> 00:32:44,039
and then people like but now my friends

00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:46,840
aren't on it and they're like huh

00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:50,320
and they're like but I can make new

00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:53,049
friends and so they started making new

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,460
friends and meeting new people and 3d

00:32:53,049 --> 00:32:57,970
chat was better for meeting new people

00:32:54,460 --> 00:33:06,250
than regular chat so like next thing you

00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:08,200
know like and they totally successful so

00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:10,690
they've added avatar home pages

00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,330
somewhere in that beginning of that

00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:17,660
yellow square

00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:22,010
they added some more

00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:23,450
with 2d and 3d avatars and like next

00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:27,650
thing you know they figured out but what

00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:30,980
did they do differently from here to

00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:32,690
here versus from there on and the key

00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:34,460
thing that they did infinitely is they

00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:37,070
started talking to their customers every

00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:39,170
day and they started running tests like

00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:41,120
do you more they start doing that

00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:43,310
retention testing but I talked about

00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,260
area they started doing that all the

00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:48,260
time they did cohort analysis they

00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:50,690
figured out the people who have this new

00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:54,020
feature use the site more or less and

00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:56,660
then they built a successful company had

00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:59,750
they built at all and then launched it

00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:02,180
and then like here you go and not listen

00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:03,590
to users as they went like if they

00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:05,570
booked all the features they thought it

00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:07,280
was gonna need they to feel absolutely

00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:10,640
the wrong product that nobody wanted

00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:15,220
because it turns out nobody wanted 3d

00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:15,220
chat integrated into Aaronson messenger

00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:24,050
so you have a new product there's three

00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:26,360
big questions that you need to answer if

00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:29,750
you want to know is this product going

00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:38,330
to be successful is it desirable is it

00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:42,410
feasible and is it viable in terms of

00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:44,570
who does what I think of you have design

00:34:42,410 --> 00:34:46,970
which I don't mean just visual design

00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:50,800
but I mean human interaction design

00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:53,870
interaction designers that whole sort of

00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:56,030
human centered design movement they're

00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:58,220
figuring out is this product desirable

00:34:56,030 --> 00:35:00,440
will people want to use this will they

00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:02,990
like it will they enjoy it that is their

00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:05,780
realm of expertise is it feasible that

00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:08,210
is us the engineers can we build this

00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:11,300
thing that you want and then is it

00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:13,220
viable you the product manager shout to

00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,620
find something that is desirable

00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,430
feasible and who can build a business

00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:19,760
model around

00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:21,380
if you can't eventually make money out

00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,800
of it then you're putting a lot of

00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:27,110
resources to get no resources back so if

00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,480
you can figure out how those things work

00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:30,300
then you win but when you never startup

00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,980
you don't know if

00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:35,550
any of those things are true at the

00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:39,840
beginning and so if you think that you

00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:43,590
can just sort of like try things out and

00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:46,260
not test and not do lots of tests

00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:48,060
quickly at low expense when you're going

00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,890
to end up doing is building something

00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:56,160
that does not have all three of those

00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:58,920
components so we've already talked about

00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:02,160
buying shoes on the Internet

00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:02,790
I just have this example about

00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,800
pre-stained

00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:10,230
other wear underwear that is awesome if

00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:14,250
oh it's not in here okay so I don't have

00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:19,710
the photo but there's a site and what

00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:24,360
they sell is pre-stained underwear and

00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:26,460
you're like same anywhere but it's got

00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:28,500
like the front pouch of anywhere is

00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:30,000
actually like you can hide your passport

00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,400
and whatnot in there I think it's got a

00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,520
big stain on it so you say that in your

00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,340
clothes in your hotel and nobody's in

00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,480
like route through that and be like oh

00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:42,780
I'm stealing that money out of that

00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:45,119
underwear so it's like a security

00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:47,250
mechanism and somebody had this idea and

00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,460
who knows whether people will buy this

00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:53,700
or not I certainly do not have the

00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:56,310
answer to this question you could use

00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:58,500
all of that like you can try selling it

00:36:56,310 --> 00:37:00,810
on Twitter you can use all these things

00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:02,490
even for tiny little business and these

00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:13,650
guys just like zapping some paint on

00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:18,150
some underwear I already told the story

00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:20,460
ahead of time the a crease guide that I

00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:23,040
mentioned the instead of guy this is a

00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:25,770
diagram for him but you have an idea you

00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,020
build something you write some code you

00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:30,330
measure it you get some data you learn

00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:32,640
and the tighter you can make this loop

00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:35,400
this shorter at the time between you

00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:38,280
have when you have an idea and you learn

00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:41,040
whether it's a good idea or not if you

00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:42,990
can do that all in one day then

00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:47,730
I'm always very much time on your bad

00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:51,030
idea if you take a year to do this you

00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:53,400
know say you got a million dollars in VC

00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:56,550
funding if you take a year and you have

00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:58,620
ten employees it's all gone like you got

00:37:56,550 --> 00:38:00,600
one shot you better be right the first

00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:04,470
time if you can do it in day you got

00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:11,070
like 365 shots depending on whether you

00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:12,270
let people take the weekend off and then

00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:15,330
you could ask the question is it

00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:17,160
feasible and so what I recommend if your

00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:21,030
startup is asked the hardest question

00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:24,300
first Facebook did not ask can we make

00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:25,650
money selling ads on the internet that

00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:30,120
was not the first question they had as

00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:33,270
they said can we get literally a billion

00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:35,940
people to sign up for our thing they're

00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:41,100
just like anyway I'm not gonna say bad

00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:47,250
things about Facebook either I'm tempted

00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:48,570
to anyway but they didn't test like can

00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,020
we make money selling ads on the

00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:51,480
Internet

00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:53,520
because that is a known quantity yes

00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:55,830
people make money selling ads on the

00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:58,530
internet like Facebook can probably do

00:38:55,830 --> 00:39:00,180
it too the question is can we make a

00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:02,340
product that is viral that people

00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:04,320
recommend to their friends that gets

00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:06,510
everyone to sign up that collects

00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:10,110
information from all these users so that

00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:12,600
we have this incredible network of

00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:14,010
information about all of these people so

00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:17,310
that we can target ads to them really

00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:20,340
well like that was the hard question the

00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:22,920
easy question is will advertisers buy

00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:24,180
ads if we have all this so they

00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,970
certainly with the hard question and

00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:29,460
then they solve the easy question later

00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:31,560
and I would recommend doing that same

00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:34,230
thing like if you have a cure for cancer

00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:37,020
you probably do not need to be spending

00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:39,690
a lot of time testing the desirability

00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:42,540
side of things like most people who have

00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:45,090
cancer will pay money if you have a cure

00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:47,130
for cancer so don't worry about that

00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:50,760
part just worry about the a cure for

00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:52,690
cancer because then you win right or if

00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,839
you had a battery that could run a car

00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:58,780
for a thousand miles and weighed like a

00:39:55,839 --> 00:40:02,380
pound nobody's gonna be like oh no we

00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:03,849
don't want to buy that if you had cold

00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:06,310
fusion reactors and could power the

00:40:03,849 --> 00:40:08,109
whole world on some water like people

00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:10,660
will buy this stuff like you don't have

00:40:08,109 --> 00:40:13,660
to like come up with a big test of

00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:15,730
desirability or feasible is there a

00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:18,069
business model that we can come up with

00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:20,319
or if you had an AIDS vaccine like these

00:40:18,069 --> 00:40:23,200
things don't matter like these things

00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:24,310
matter do these things figure it out and

00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,619
then you don't have to worry about the

00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:28,089
other part but if you're making a new

00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:30,210
photo sharing site on the world you

00:40:28,089 --> 00:40:33,300
better be paying attention to viability

00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:39,270
and fees but I mean feasibility is easy

00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:39,270
so don't test feasibility test viability

00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:47,560
so or say you're sourceforge.net you've

00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:50,650
lost money for nine years in a row

00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:55,089
well one quarter you made money in nine

00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:57,550
years you should probably be testing

00:40:55,089 --> 00:41:00,040
like can I make a viable product can I

00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:02,710
make a business model that works and

00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:04,810
over the last two years they did they

00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:07,210
figured out a way to balance the needs

00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:11,740
of developers and users and downloaders

00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:15,430
and advertisers and be profitable and

00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:17,260
they did it by doing experiments lots

00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:21,550
and lots of experiments what if we do

00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:23,950
this what if we do that this other

00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:27,069
people who may be searching for a

00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:34,500
business model I won't name names oh and

00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:34,500
I did in fact have these it's awesome

00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:44,619
well I don't know

00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,180
so like this what is the hardest problem

00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:47,829
if you're trying to sell this maybe you

00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:53,520
need to sell it in multiple colors maybe

00:41:47,829 --> 00:41:53,520
you need there are tests you can run

00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,520
so one last thing I will show is this

00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:07,440
big slide that has a lot of information

00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:09,900
on it basically you can sit here in the

00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:12,930
middle of this side this sense that

00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:14,790
happens before you get to the middle but

00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:16,470
is stuff you should do before you scale

00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:19,079
up your business the stuff that happens

00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:22,020
the other side there's stuff you do

00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:24,750
after you have found what they call

00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:27,270
product market fit product market fit

00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:31,290
means you have people they want to buy

00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:33,079
you things that you made it's not rocket

00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:37,170
science but it's harder than you think

00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:39,750
like most people most companies no

00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:42,510
setups fill not because they fail to

00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:44,940
build something useful but they fail to

00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:46,650
build something that anyone wants like

00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:49,280
the thing they built works it just

00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:51,809
doesn't do anything anyone cares about

00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,880
so once you get something that people

00:42:51,809 --> 00:42:55,500
care about then you have to scale up

00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,450
execution you have to scare the

00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:59,579
organization in the sales organization

00:42:57,450 --> 00:43:01,710
and there's a bunch of things to do and

00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:05,180
that's a lot of hard work and that side

00:43:01,710 --> 00:43:08,819
of that but this is all about learning

00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:11,150
this is all about doing this is all

00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:13,650
about figuring out what will work

00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:15,809
running experiments as fast as you can

00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:17,490
so that you can figure it out and

00:43:15,809 --> 00:43:21,359
there's this thing called a pivot which

00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:25,530
is you came up with an idea and maybe it

00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:27,660
was this idea and you're like hey I'm

00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:30,089
gonna make a million dollars on st.

00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:32,460
underwear and then it turns out nobody

00:43:30,089 --> 00:43:34,319
really wants them because they're right

00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:36,150
and their underwear actually wait and so

00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:38,339
now it stands out so now you're like

00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:41,400
okay what do we do there's two things

00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:43,530
you can do you can try harder to sell

00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,540
the original thing you can adjust it in

00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:46,680
little ways it may be like well I'm

00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:49,049
gonna offer it in a lot of different

00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:50,280
colors because clearly that was the

00:43:49,049 --> 00:43:55,410
reason people didn't want stained

00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:57,809
underwear and you can do that or you can

00:43:55,410 --> 00:43:59,670
be like hey people don't want this in

00:43:57,809 --> 00:44:02,099
their suitcase because their spouse /

00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:05,430
girlfriend whoever sees it and then

00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:10,730
that's it like bad relationship so

00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:10,730
and sure nobody found my passport but

00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:15,870
like so in that case you need to do

00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:20,970
what's called a pivot a pivot is not

00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:24,300
just little minor adjustment in the plan

00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:26,010
a pivot is a what we would call in the

00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:30,720
structure of scientific revolutions term

00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:32,640
a paradigm shift and it is hey maybe I

00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:34,230
should stop trying to sell stained

00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,630
underwear and I should come up with

00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:39,390
something else like maybe some other

00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:40,860
like innocuous looking thing that could

00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:43,350
sit in someone's suitcase and nobody

00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:46,500
will search through me or not I'm

00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:50,010
relying on people's fear of people too

00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:52,410
much or maybe not enough maybe you need

00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:55,980
real poop I don't know who knows how

00:44:52,410 --> 00:44:58,140
these things work maybe people should

00:44:55,980 --> 00:45:04,020
just try them with a dog and stick the

00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:16,260
passport on it anyway so with that any

00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:19,110
questions question yeah well thank you

00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:21,750
for this awesome presentation and I have

00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:26,070
a question regarding the circle and you

00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:30,110
said that it's would be good if the if

00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:34,820
the time about the duration of this

00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:34,820
cycle is small

00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:43,010
okay yeah it would be great if the cycle

00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:46,970
is small do you have some tips how to

00:45:43,010 --> 00:45:51,140
keep this circle small or huh how can I

00:45:46,970 --> 00:45:54,980
do it in one day not in one year okay so

00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:57,590
a mirror tips to keep it small it

00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:59,750
depends what you're trying to do and but

00:45:57,590 --> 00:46:02,240
like I talked about the Zappos example

00:45:59,750 --> 00:46:04,460
like if they try to actually have an

00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:06,770
inventory of shoes and like make this

00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:08,930
all work then it would have taken a long

00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:10,460
time but they just went out and took

00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:16,910
pictures of shoes that they could buy at

00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:19,460
other stores or say you're SourceForge

00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:24,290
you spend a week and you're like I'm

00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:27,470
gonna fix one project page like the say

00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:29,600
you pick VLC because VLC has a lot of

00:46:27,470 --> 00:46:31,490
traffic they're a big project for us and

00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:33,890
you say hey what if we added this

00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:35,540
feature to their project summary page

00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:37,940
with more people download it or less

00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:40,940
people then you don't even have to like

00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:43,610
code up something like all you do is you

00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:45,230
have a designer write some sonic HTML

00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:47,540
for that page the way it would look with

00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:50,000
the new feature and then you display

00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:52,460
that page and then you've done run a

00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,800
test you don't do any of the backend

00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:57,260
coding work you don't do any anything

00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,450
except the minimal amount of work you

00:46:57,260 --> 00:47:02,570
need to run the task to get the data

00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:05,480
that you need so kind of if you plan to

00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:08,390
implement some page or some EPS and you

00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:12,860
have to make some more caps and write to

00:47:08,390 --> 00:47:14,750
your users to your probably users and so

00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:18,080
another thing that people do is they

00:47:14,750 --> 00:47:20,390
will make a landing page for a product

00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:21,770
that they're going to sell without

00:47:20,390 --> 00:47:24,260
making the products that they're going

00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:26,810
cell has the ad and it's like buy now

00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:28,580
and you see people click to the Buy Now

00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:31,970
button if nobody clicks the Buy Now

00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:33,770
button do not build it and if they you

00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:33,950
could get you be like oh it's not ready

00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:35,420
yet

00:47:33,950 --> 00:47:38,270
would you like to sign up for our

00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:40,550
mailing list and be told when it does

00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:42,200
exist and some people will say yes a lot

00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:45,740
of people will be like oh those jerks

00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:47,480
but at least you know and he didn't

00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:51,020
your life building something nobody

00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:53,720
wants so would you be so kind to add

00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:55,190
some references to books or to you if

00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:57,230
you post your slides on the Internet

00:47:55,190 --> 00:48:02,030
I'll post my slides and I'll reference

00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:06,830
the books the big books are there's lean

00:48:02,030 --> 00:48:09,500
startup and the four steps to the

00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:11,330
Epiphany is the Steve Blank book those

00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,110
two books are the ones that changed

00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:14,270
everything

00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:15,980
like lots and lots of people are doing

00:48:14,270 --> 00:48:18,380
if you search on lean startup you'll

00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:20,300
find all kinds of tips for doing this

00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:28,850
sort of product development you very

00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:31,369
much hey-ya a great talk I was funny

00:48:28,850 --> 00:48:34,930
weird doing a lot of tests at my company

00:48:31,369 --> 00:48:37,790
and we used a lot of funnels let's see

00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:39,770
how users are doing it in different like

00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:42,500
several steps mm-hmm hey say something

00:48:39,770 --> 00:48:44,660
about like different kind of tests and

00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:47,960
what is like the most valuable for you

00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:50,810
like and which test works and and so

00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:53,450
when you're optimizing things looking at

00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:55,100
the funnel and figuring out like at what

00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:58,450
points in the funnel two people drop out

00:48:55,100 --> 00:49:02,330
that gives you lots of good information

00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:06,200
when you're trying to just a brand new

00:49:02,330 --> 00:49:08,810
feature that may not be easily fallible

00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:11,810
like it's get commit browsing on

00:49:08,810 --> 00:49:13,910
SourceForge like that sort of thing what

00:49:11,810 --> 00:49:17,690
we you will want to do is cohort

00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:19,790
analysis or like dua a B test where some

00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:21,320
users get it and other users don't and

00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:24,770
look at the difference

00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:29,890
I find split when you have enough

00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:32,270
traffic for it split testing is the most

00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:35,000
valuable in terms of giving you a lot of

00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:36,950
raw data when they what Rob ate it

00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,350
doesn't make any sense to you at all

00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:41,330
then you want to move to like individual

00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:44,960
user testing like that user testing comm

00:49:41,330 --> 00:49:47,450
site I said or just like go to a coffee

00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:49,880
shop and make someone use your product

00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:51,560
and ask them what they're thinking while

00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:52,240
they're doing it the book I would

00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:55,870
recommend there

00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:58,660
is it's not rocket surgery by Steve Koon

00:49:55,870 --> 00:50:02,020
it's like a hundred page book you can

00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:04,270
read it on the airplane flight get it on

00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:06,700
Kindle read on your plane at home that

00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:09,100
will like if you do that testing which

00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:10,630
takes like literally going to a coffee

00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:13,150
shop and asking someone to use your

00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:15,760
product for 10 minutes or look at your

00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:17,170
webpage for 10 minutes and asking them

00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:20,710
some questions about what they see and

00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:24,090
how it works that one thing will make

00:50:20,710 --> 00:50:27,330
your website or your product better

00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:29,710
faster than anything else you can do but

00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:31,660
it doesn't give you aggregate data it

00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:34,300
gives you one person's opinion but

00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:36,520
usually that one person's opinion gives

00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:39,010
you like 80% of the total insight that

00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:40,950
you could get like and then you're doing

00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:43,330
tests to get all the rest

00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:45,190
so that's my if you can only do one

00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:48,850
thing do that thing and it's cheap and

00:50:45,190 --> 00:50:54,580
it's easy so not doing it is not really

00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:59,400
excusable hi well my previous employers

00:50:54,580 --> 00:51:02,800
just arose through this acronym MVP

00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:05,110
Minimum Viable Product the yeah which

00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:08,470
basically kind of gives them free rein

00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:13,300
to say well this works and just go off

00:51:08,470 --> 00:51:17,710
and build it what's your opinion why is

00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:20,890
this does this even fit and so Minimum

00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:25,300
Viable Product is a big buzzword in the

00:51:20,890 --> 00:51:28,240
lean startup community and in the lean

00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:31,720
in air creases definition of minimal

00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:34,210
Viable Product it has one meaning which

00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:35,740
is it is the minimum amount of the

00:51:34,210 --> 00:51:40,900
products that you want to build that

00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:44,920
will answer the question is it viable it

00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:46,900
is not will this product do everything

00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:49,270
will do what it should be on OA

00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:51,550
it is like say you're trying to sell

00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:53,650
shoes on the Internet the Minimum Viable

00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:54,690
Product is a webpage that someone can

00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:56,730
click

00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:59,400
whether people will buy shoes on the

00:51:56,730 --> 00:52:02,640
internet it answers the most pressing

00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:05,040
question that you have so you built the

00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:08,130
smallest amount that you can build to

00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:10,230
answer the question that you have so if

00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:12,540
they don't have a question they don't

00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:14,490
have a Minimum Viable Product like

00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:18,030
they're not doing this in a rigorous

00:52:14,490 --> 00:52:20,579
scientific way they're just throwing

00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:22,200
around buzz words from the that's still

00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:24,440
doing it the old way it's like people

00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:27,480
who feel like what we don't do planning

00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:29,369
so we're agile like that's not what

00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,780
agile development is like they don't do

00:52:29,369 --> 00:52:33,450
stand-ups they don't do anything all

00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:36,750
they do is not plan that's not doing

00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:39,079
agile saying you're building the Minimum

00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:48,569
Viable Product doesn't mean you're doing

00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:50,609
Lean Startup where you've got to figure

00:52:48,569 --> 00:52:52,619
out like try and push it back to the

00:52:50,609 --> 00:52:57,420
what question are we trying to answer

00:52:52,619 --> 00:53:00,030
how do what what would a viable product

00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:04,619
look like and what question are we

00:53:00,030 --> 00:53:06,599
testing like then you can say is this

00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:08,339
the minute part is this an important

00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:10,530
part of a Minimum Viable Product

00:53:08,339 --> 00:53:12,750
or is it outside of the Minimum Viable

00:53:10,530 --> 00:53:16,440
Product until you know what question

00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:18,180
you're trying to answer you can't so if

00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:20,040
you ask for that question and they can't

00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:22,170
come up with it then have a converse

00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:25,710
they're wrong just have a conversation

00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:27,810
about what that question is so that you

00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:29,190
can understand and then they can

00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:31,319
understand because they didn't think of

00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:33,420
it yet either and then once you've got

00:53:31,319 --> 00:53:36,390
an understanding then loop back around

00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:38,069
to the thing and say okay now does this

00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:40,640
mean that it's part of the Minimum

00:53:38,069 --> 00:53:42,660
Viable Product and like try and

00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:46,980
structure the discussion so it's not

00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:49,619
adversarial it would be my like to say

00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:52,680
hey like you know you have has anybody

00:53:49,619 --> 00:53:55,530
seen Columbo camera is my favorite

00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:57,300
because he just acts stupid and that's

00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:59,010
how he solves everything it was like

00:53:57,300 --> 00:54:03,329
could you explain that to me

00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:05,740
I do this all the time like it being

00:54:03,329 --> 00:54:08,150
stupid is great

00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:10,010
because then people will explain stuff

00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:11,000
to you and then they have to actually

00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:12,950
figure it out

00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,329
and so they figure it out for you and

00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:18,589
you don't have to do anything except be

00:54:14,329 --> 00:54:21,400
like but wait I confused could he

00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:24,770
explain this part and then they have and

00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:27,170
obviously you're not you could say that

00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:28,070
sounds confused like have you really

00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:30,410
thought this through

00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:36,460
you're an idiot but that would be mean

00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:39,460
as you say I'm confused then you know

00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:39,460
yep

00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:50,670
hi what do you think about social

00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:54,500
pledging or something like Kickstarter

00:54:50,670 --> 00:54:54,500
to discover your customers

00:54:54,980 --> 00:55:01,590
Kickstarter is a great innovation in the

00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:03,420
idea of like having a Minimum Viable

00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:07,050
Product because you describe your

00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:08,850
product and then people like yes I heard

00:55:07,050 --> 00:55:11,900
died that but they're not just saying

00:55:08,850 --> 00:55:14,760
they work this kind of a commitment and

00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:18,000
like that means you have a viable

00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:20,580
product like you build the thing like so

00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,560
I'm a huge fan of Kickstarter like I

00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:25,170
think what's interesting about

00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:27,390
Kickstarter is like the idea like a

00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:28,890
friend of mine was pitching like that

00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:31,320
he's going to create a Kickstarter

00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:34,620
company where all he do is help you

00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:37,110
write your Kickstarter thing so that you

00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:38,970
could get funding for your things and I

00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:41,070
thought that was crazy and then I was

00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:43,830
like oh maybe you need to do a

00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:45,360
Kickstarter say hey I would start a

00:55:43,830 --> 00:55:49,500
company to help people write their

00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:54,810
Kickstarter plans if I got $10,000 of

00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:59,280
people pledging that they want it then

00:55:54,810 --> 00:56:02,270
he didn't write a Kickstarter but like

00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:04,230
it's great to get commitments and before

00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:07,400
Kickstarter one of the ways that people

00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:10,020
do is you would go out and you'd say hey

00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,700
would you buy this thing if I had it to

00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:13,340
sell you and they would say yes and then

00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:16,470
you say would you sign a piece of paper

00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:18,690
that is not binding in any way that says

00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:22,080
yes I would buy this thing if you would

00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:24,300
sell it to me for this price and a lot

00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:26,100
of times we say I would buy it but they

00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:28,320
would say no I will not sign that piece

00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:30,480
of paper and then they know that they

00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,900
kind of maybe would buy it but not

00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,300
really

00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:36,660
but Kickstarter takes that up one more

00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:38,910
notch and that is awesome no but

00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:42,080
sometimes like if it's a $10,000 or

00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:43,890
$100,000 like solution for your bank

00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:46,380
you're not gonna be able to use

00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:48,090
Kickstarter you're gonna go and try and

00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:52,440
get people to sign this I would use it

00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:55,200
if you built it which is described in

00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:56,900
the four steps to the Epiphany so meet

00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:03,650
that book

00:56:56,900 --> 00:57:06,070
questions questions no that's perfect

00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:09,140
cuz we had one a minute yeah so

00:57:06,070 --> 00:57:12,250
excellent telling everyone good job

00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:12,250
great audience

00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:23,560
