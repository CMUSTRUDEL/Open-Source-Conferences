By William Horton

The Jupyter Notebook: many Python users love it, many other Python users love to hate it. But where did it come from? How did we come to have a tool that combines code execution, visualization, Markdown, and more? In this talk, we will dive into the development of the Jupyter Notebook and the older ideas that it built upon. 

To start, we will look at tools that popularized the “computational notebook” interface. In 1988, Mathematica introduced this interface to the scientific community. In the 90s, tools like Maple competed with Mathematica to provide the best scientific programming environment. The early 2000s saw the rise in popularity of open-source scientific tools in Python, including IPython, leading to IPython Notebook and then Jupyter.

Turning to the present, we look at the expanding ecosystem beyond the Notebook. JupyterLab provides a richer programming environment. Voilà and Binder give users better options for sharing their notebooks. And increased language support has led to Jupyter being a tool not only for Julia, Python, and R, but for dozens of other languages.

Finally: what is still to come? JupyerLab 2.0 promises even greater IDE-like capabilities, while IDEs increase their own Notebook support. Projects like Deepnote and CoCalc promise real-time collaboration on top of the Notebook interface. And the frustrations of working with Git are the source of a growing number of possible solutions. These efforts point us toward what the Jupyter Notebook could become.

okay welcome

00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:15,360
to the next session after dinner

00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,360
or whatever your time zone

00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,760
um our next speaker is william horton he

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,640
will talk

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,920
um about jupiter notebooks even better a

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:27,279
brief history

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:30,800
of jupiter notebooks

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:33,200
please go on thank you for the

00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,920
introduction um my name is william

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,320
horton

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,360
uh this is a brief history of jupiter

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,600
notebooks

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,440
um i'm excited to be speaking at euro

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,200
python this is my first

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,280
virtual conference and you might be able

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,280
to tell from the background here that

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,320
i'm i'm not in europe i'm in new york

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,360
wearing my

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,719
kai gotham t-shirt to represent our

00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:55,199
community here

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,760
but i'm excited to have the chance to

00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:00,079
present to you all today

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,039
so the first question you might have is

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,600
why this talk

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,320
what is so interesting about uh jupiter

00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,720
notebooks and

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,600
and particularly the history of jupiter

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,000
notebooks

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,360
and where this talk comes from is really

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,640
my observation that

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,360
there's increasingly two different

00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,159
worlds of python uh there's a world

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,200
in which python looks like this and

00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,880
there's another world

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,880
in which python looks like this

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,040
and for those of you who are maybe more

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,799
familiar with the first world than the

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,200
second i'll give a little bit

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,400
of background on what a jupyter notebook

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,720
is what it can do

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,680
so the code goes into these things

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,920
called cells

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,360
and those cells are able to be executed

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,880
with python code

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,360
uh the other interesting thing you can

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,759
do with cells is you can put in markdown

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,439
so it actually is able to format text

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,640
using markdown and display that in the

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,720
notebook as well

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,720
uh and so that's just a little bit about

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,560
the jupyter notebook this isn't

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,920
really an explanation of how it works

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,600
but i just wanted to make sure we were

00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,119
all on the same page

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,640
in terms of what we're actually talking

00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,399
about when i say jupiter notebooks

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,840
and for those of you who are familiar

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,640
with jupiter notebooks you can see that

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,479
i

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,679
kept to the standard naming convention

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,840
for uh

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,080
jupiter notebooks untitled one if i had

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,920
another one on title two untitled three

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,080
and so on and another inspiration for

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,000
this talk was my own personal journey

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,599
uh when i first started learning python

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,239
it was mostly in the context

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,120
of web applications maybe some data

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,599
processing

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,599
uh and so all the python i wrote was uh

00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,879
you know edited in an ide

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:37,920
uh it was in dot pi files it looked like

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,440
that kind of python but then

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,280
a couple years back i got very

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,000
interested in machine learning through

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,720
the fast ai courses which make extensive

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,760
uses

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,879
of notebooks so for a while um i was in

00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,319
this scenario where

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,560
everything i was doing professionally

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,000
was in dot pi files and i was spending a

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,280
lot of my time learning these other

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,120
things

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,720
exclusively through notebooks and so

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,680
that kind of

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,319
led me to observe this split now my

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,959
current role

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:05,519
i work on machine learning so i find

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,319
myself

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,360
kind of working on a mix of things um

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,800
still working with

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,360
python files for applications and

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,319
and service code but then increasingly

00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,239
having to

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,840
read other people's notebooks from data

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,599
scientists and understand those

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,280
as well as write some of my own

00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:26,400
notebooks for

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,920
data analysis feature exploration so

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,000
even in

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,519
my experience as just one developer i've

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,840
increasingly seen this

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,959
kind of confluence of different ways

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,319
that people write

00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,560
python and if you're

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,840
familiar at all with this ecosystem you

00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,480
might know that there have been some

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,440
tensions between these two worlds

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,879
kind of a major example is joel groos

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,680
went to jupiter con the

00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,680
the conference for jupiter and gave this

00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,920
whole talk called i don't like notebooks

00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,319
uh and kind of laid out the reasons why

00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,480
he does not like this interface

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,840
and that spawned a lot of back and forth

00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,080
that this one talk called

00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,080
the first notebook war um a lot of

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,480
tweets and blog posts were written

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,840
about loving jupiter notebooks or hating

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,519
jupiter notebooks

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,439
um and there's a lot of material out

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,400
there uh on that topic

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,919
but i was kind of thinking is there some

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,199
other way that we can approach this

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,680
instead of lobbing

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,400
uh yet another volley in this notebook

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,759
war

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,080
is there a different way of looking at

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,000
things and

00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,240
when i came across this tweet by jeremy

00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,479
howard the founder of fastai

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,080
uh it kind of inspired me to start

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,720
thinking about things in this way and he

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,720
wrote

00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,320
i do think mathematica doesn't get the

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,040
credit it deserves for pioneering

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,800
notebooks

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,240
and this was in response to a hacker

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,759
news comment

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,560
about the development of notebooks

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,000
through not only mathematica but sage

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,919
and some of these other tools that i'm

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,240
going to talk about in

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,000
my talk and so this kind of got me

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,600
thinking what if instead of fighting

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,560
about why we love or hate humor

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,280
notebooks

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,400
we seek to understand the history um

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,560
both for

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,600
people who are using notebooks already

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,280
maybe get

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,199
an interesting look in how the tool came

00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,680
to be for those people who

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,520
don't use them maybe get some empathy

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,479
for users of the tool and understand

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,160
that

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,160
jupiter notebooks are not something that

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,280
data scientists invented a couple years

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,759
ago just to annoy

00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,720
engineers there really is a rich history

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,039
to this and

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,720
i hope to show you some of that in the

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,360
presentation

00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,360
it didn't come out of nowhere the

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,840
jupiter notebook and in fact i go far

00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,080
as to say no significant piece of

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,039
software comes out of nowhere

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,160
every program that gets developed really

00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,320
brings together

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,600
different threads and ideas that have

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,120
been circulating

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,360
not only for years maybe even for

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,960
decades as we'll see

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,400
and i think this is a really important

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,000
point to understand

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,960
not just about jupiter notebooks but

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,039
about all the tools that we use

00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,240
and so in the particular case of jupiter

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,919
notebooks

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,280
you can identify i think several

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,639
long-term trends there's others you

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,280
could point out but these are the ones

00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,919
that i've

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,800
organized the talk around one the most

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,039
obvious maybe

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,240
is scientific computing so this is where

00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,520
these tools come from

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,400
the desire to use computing and

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,919
programming

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,520
for scientific endeavors another trend

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,520
or kind of thread is literate

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,680
programming and we'll talk a little bit

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,039
more about that idea

00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,080
another major um factor that played into

00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,800
jupiter notebooks

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,720
uh was proprietary versus open source

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,880
and finally since this is euro python

00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,479
obviously we'll talk about python and

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,479
where that comes in

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,160
this talk is organized in three parts

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,160
past present and future

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,160
since it is a brief history i'll spend

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,680
most of the time talking about the past

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,759
but i do want to take some time to

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,880
consider uh what that means to the

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,280
present the last

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,560
few years and also what it might mean

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,440
looking into the future

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,199
of what jupiter notebooks could be so to

00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,680
start off with the past

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,280
and i start with an apology to any

00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,520
former science phd

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,280
i know a lot of you got into python

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,840
specifically to avoid some of these

00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,560
tools

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,080
that i'm going to be talking about today

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,759
but

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,880
be warned that i'm going to be talking

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,360
about some of these things that you

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,560
might have

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,440
thought were in your past so the story

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,080
of the notebook

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,800
uh in some ways starts with this man who

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,240
you might know

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,319
as the guy who helped you with your

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,039
high school algebra homework uh through

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:30,080
the wolfram alpha interface

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:32,800
but before wolfram alpha he created

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,639
this tool called mathematica in 1988

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,160
stephen wolfram created it

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,400
uh and it really was an all-in-one

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,160
system for computer algebra and other

00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,080
kinds of scientific computing

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,199
it included a language which he modestly

00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,440
named wolfram

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,960
a whole execution environment as well as

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,879
many useful libraries

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,720
and another important point and what

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,360
brings mathematica into the presentation

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,280
today

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,960
is it contained a notebook interface

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,039
designed by theodore gray and it was

00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,560
really one of the first popular tools

00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,560
to embed this kind of notebook interface

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,160
and at the time mathematica was very

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,960
well received and

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,960
this magazine by magazine included it in

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,919
an annual set of awards and you can see

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,919
that it

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,440
says mathematica was very useful for

00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,720
students and for doing these kinds of

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,080
mathematical

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,639
operations um the interesting thing is

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,160
this magazine is archived so we can see

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,360
what other things won these awards at

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,639
the same time and

00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,639
understand a little bit about the

00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,080
computing environment that mathematica

00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,280
came out in

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:34,880
so you can see next computer um

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:37,519
so steve jobs kind of come back project

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,959
won an award at this time some of you

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,360
might recognize this some of you might

00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,320
not

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,599
uh this is hp deskjet printer state of

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,360
the art at the time and it could be

00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,240
yours for the low price of 9.95 that's

00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:51,440
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,040
at the time and an advertisement for

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,480
advanced ms programming

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:59,040
second edition uh so if you wanted to

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,959
brush up on your ms-dos skills this was

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,880
also in that magazine

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,640
uh so that sets the stage a little bit

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,800
about what kind of was

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,279
going on at the time that mathematica

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,560
came out uh and we can understand also a

00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,080
little bit about the technical

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,680
implementation of it

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,519
uh there were two parts of this system

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,360
and this becomes a very key part

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,560
of the history of notebooks there was a

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,240
kernel and a front end

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,320
and so the front end was designed to

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,880
accept the user's input which could be

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,800
uh mathematica commands and other things

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,000
and send it to the kernel the kernel was

00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,040
responsible for doing all the

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,800
computation

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,320
and then returning output to be

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,560
displayed in the front end

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,560
another interesting thing mathematica

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,200
notebooks were objects that themselves

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,920
could be

00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,360
manipulated by mathematica programs uh

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,680
and you'll see that kind of

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,240
going forward that uh the actual

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,240
representation of the notebook document

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,440
becomes also important in addition to

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,640
the kind of kernel

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,120
and front-end setup so

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,720
we can actually look at some uh archived

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,519
photos of what this notebook interface

00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,920
looked like

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,200
so here's one example uh i'm not a

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,839
mathematician but

00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,279
it seems to be doing some kind of series

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,920
expansion and you can see some things

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,920
that if you're

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,760
a regular user of jupiter might seem

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,720
familiar to you so you have this in

00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:15,279
out organization you enter the command

00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,760
and it outputs the

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,880
computational results another really

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,200
cool thing that you can see

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,399
and i remind you this was like late 80s

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,880
early 90s is

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,160
the ability to do these 3d plots in the

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,160
mathematica notebook

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,000
and so this is a really powerful feature

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,360
and something that drives notebook

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,480
adoption i think

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,760
across many decades but

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,920
the story of the notebook interface

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,000
doesn't really start with

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,440
mathematica and stephen wolfram to

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,760
really understand the root of it we have

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,760
to go even further back

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,519
further back to a man you might know is

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,720
the author of a book that every engineer

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,279
claims to have read

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,800
but nobody has actually finished the art

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:56,560
of computer programming

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,640
so this is donald knuth and he not only

00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,760
wrote the art of computer programming he

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,480
came up with this

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,600
idea of literate programming and

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,480
literary programming

00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,000
implemented a system he called web which

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,800
i think turned out to be unfortunate

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,440
naming

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,440
on his part but the web system embedded

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,120
these concepts of tangled and woven and

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,279
those are in fact the two

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,200
main commands that made up the system

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,839
and so the idea was you would create

00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,240
this source

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,040
text and the source text contained both

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,839
code

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,880
as well as just normal text and

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,200
documentation

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,320
and the tangle part would take that

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,720
whole text

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,760
and generate just compilable code from

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,880
the source

00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,600
the wii part would take that whole thing

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,240
and generate a formatted documentation

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,040
from that

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,640
exact same source uh total kind of

00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,000
source text that you had and so these

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,760
were kind of two

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,440
uh of the main functionalities that made

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,480
up the web system the way that he

00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,800
implemented

00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,680
his idea of literate programming and

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,079
this wasn't just

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,120
say an abstract exercise or a theory on

00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,440
his part

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,120
he actually used litter programming and

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,040
web to implement tech

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,880
which is a very popular typesetting

00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:08,000
system that is still used

00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:09,360
today so this is an early example of how

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,079
some of these ideas of literature

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,519
programming

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:15,760
can be applied to build complex systems

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,720
so returning to kind of our history of

00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:19,760
scientific

00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,959
computing tools the next major one to

00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,800
look at after

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:24,480
mathematica in terms of the notebook

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,440
interface was maple

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,240
maple similar to mathematica embedded

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,079
these

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,680
scientific computing libraries in its

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,320
own language and

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,160
the first gui came out in 1989 and then

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,240
a few years later in 92

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,680
it came out with the worksheet interface

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,760
which is

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,519
the same kind of interface as a notebook

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,880
allowing you to combine

00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,639
uh text and code and graphics

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,000
so we can look at a couple of

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,079
screenshots to see

00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,519
what did maple look like and you can see

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,720
a familiar pattern

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,399
input computation of code as well as the

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,240
ability to do these more complex

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,279
mathematical operations like

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,639
factorizations and again you can see a

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,959
very cool

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,040
example where it can actually do a 3d

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,519
plot and in this case even a 3d plot

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,320
with

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,040
color graphics and so you can see that

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,040
from the

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,720
kind of start the ability to do these

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:20,320
kinds of plots was a very important

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:24,800
component of these notebook interfaces

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:27,120
so um maple versus mathematica

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,639
was uh was an important question and

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,639
these tools were kind of competing in

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,120
the early 90s

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,440
now what i'm about to present came from

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,399
a maple published document on

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,079
things that i thought were clear

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,440
advantages but i think it actually

00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,000
provides an interesting

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:44,079
um kind of pro and con for the ways you

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,720
could to

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,800
define these systems so the first thing

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,600
is the use of math notation so you look

00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,760
on the left

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,880
and you can see that maple used a much

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,160
more familiar

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,399
to mathematicians syntax um

00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,240
but the funny thing is to me as kind of

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,560
a more of a programmer

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,920
the mathematica syntax looks much

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,920
preferable it has

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:08,399
the familiar double equals the function

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,040
calls look more recognizable as function

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,199
calls

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,240
and so this is one thing that kind of

00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,760
starts to be

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:17,839
um some kind of tension in is

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,760
who are these tools for do we represent

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,720
in a more mathematical way do we adopt a

00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:24,800
more kind of

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,399
uh coding or programmer style

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,720
another interesting thing maple could do

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,000
is actually reevaluate code that you

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,399
embedded in the text

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,399
and so this case you have a function it

00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,320
computes something off of that function

00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,920
in this case the discontinuity if you

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,040
actually update the function

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,760
it can basically recompute that

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,320
and come up with a new result that gets

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:48,160
embedded

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:50,399
in your text and finally i think this is

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,000
just an interesting historical point

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,519
when maple came out they thought that

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,320
mathematica's use of shift

00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:58,079
enter uh was just totally wrong and the

00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,399
user should always just be able to

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,360
hit enter in order to execute a cell and

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,760
those of you who

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,240
use juvenile books know that in this

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:09,519
case historically maple ended up losing

00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:13,360
and the shift enter shift enter pattern

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:15,600
was adopted by later interfaces

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,040
so maple mathematica were both very

00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,000
powerful tools but

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,720
there was one big problem and that was

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,959
cost

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,839
these were both proprietary tools and

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,000
they had

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,440
expensive licenses sometimes paid for by

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,440
institutions

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,880
and you can see these are still

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,399
available and those are the costs for

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,320
personal licenses

00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,560
so this is where the notebook interface

00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,440
coincides with another major trend in

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,440
software history the rise of open source

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,519
and particularly in this case we'll look

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,120
at a couple of important scientific

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,440
computing libraries that came out

00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,240
around the early 2000s and so this

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,360
includes

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,079
scipy which were open source scientific

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,639
libraries

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,440
as well as ipython which basically

00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,399
provided uh

00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,480
improved python terminal experience uh

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,199
compared to the normal python command

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,240
as well as um additional functionality

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,639
for

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,000
distributed computing so this is one

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,720
example of ipython

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,040
still very widely used today uh i almost

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,120
always default to ipython compared to

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,320
regular python it gives you some nice

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,639
functionality

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,600
um and so this ends up being a very

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,680
important tool

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,360
in the in the story we're telling of the

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,920
jupiter notebooks

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,040
the last library uh that kind of is part

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,519
of this group

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,480
is matplotlib and there is a very funny

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,920
anecdote

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,279
i found while researching this talk

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,160
where basically matplotlib was

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,920
originally

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:40,560
conceived as a uh patch for ipython

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,240
but fernetta perez the creator by python

00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,800
didn't have time to review the patch

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,399
and so the creator matplotlib uh created

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,759
it as a separate library and that's

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,120
still very widely used

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:53,440
uh to this day

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,800
so i mentioned fernando perez and in the

00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,800
story of jupiter notebooks

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,160
um his name is probably the most

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,639
important to remember

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,279
he created ipython in 2001 as a grad

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,120
student

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,559
he's currently an associate professor at

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,640
berkeley as well as

00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:08,079
a founder of the berkeley institute for

00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,839
data science

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,480
and he's received many awards for his

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:15,679
work on these open source

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:18,000
scientific tools and so

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,199
he plays a large role in this kind of

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,720
later history of

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,480
notebooks as we'll see and

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,079
this is a very interesting thing he

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,120
actually has put up a gist of the

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:31,600
initial commit to ipython um

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,960
and it's very interesting because in

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,640
kind of tracing these histories

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,280
sometimes we have to rely on

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,360
inference or saying this kind of

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,960
interface resembles this interface but

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,400
you can see from one of the comments he

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,080
actually says the

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,799
prompts the in and out prompts for

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,160
ipython are similar to mathematica

00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,480
so he's kind of mentioning that

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,240
influence and i'll also say thank you to

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,520
pablo andrewshenko

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,120
he actually posted this in the channel

00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,919
for the talk today and i thought it was

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,360
so cool that i

00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:01,280
i wanted to make a slide out of it so

00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,600
the next kind of step toward the the

00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:07,280
jupiter notebook uh in this history

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:09,280
is a tool called sagemath or sage and

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,640
this really brought together a lot of

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,840
these threads that were

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,840
um kind of converging which is the need

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,440
or want to do scientific computing

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,320
as well as the use of these open source

00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:23,840
packages and wanting to do that in a

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,480
nice web interface and so basically sage

00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,960
said

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,520
we're going to provide an open source

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,960
tool

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,559
that will embed a lot of these

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,559
scientific packages it

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,000
it's written in python it's released

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,320
with an open source license

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,919
and you can see even that they're saying

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,559
this is supposed to be an open source

00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,080
alternative

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:44,080
to some of these other tools that we've

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,080
talked about maple and mathematica

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,880
and this gives you a little bit of a

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,160
look at what the sage notebook looked

00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:53,600
like

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:55,440
this is from around 2012 and one cool

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,280
thing i wanted to point out is the sage

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,919
notebook actually embedded rich text

00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,200
editing

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,640
which is something i found out when

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,840
working on this talk that i think is so

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,440
cool

00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,960
and not something that i've seen in a

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,559
juvenile notebook so

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,400
if that functionality doesn't already

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,960
exist maybe there's an opportunity for

00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,679
an open source contribution

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,960
i'll also say sage further cemented this

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:18,240
shift enter pattern as

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,280
as the winner in notebook uh user

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,640
experience so

00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:25,840
you have sage to thank for continuing uh

00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,280
shift enter shift enter finally we get

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,360
to the ipython notebook

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,120
um so this was an interface that was

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,720
initially embedded in the ipython

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,080
library you could start it up

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,679
by running ipython notebook and

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,919
basically it contained two main

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,720
components there is the web application

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,760
which actually allowed you to interact

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,080
and

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,600
run your code and embed visualizations

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,039
as well as the document itself the

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,080
notebook

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:54,480
and the representation of it and

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,000
eventually i python gets ipython

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,919
notebook gets spun out into project

00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,600
jupiter in 2014

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,039
and another cool thing i learned when i

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,720
was working on this talk is

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,159
where the name jupiter came from it

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,760
actually comes from the three languages

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:09,600
that were supported originally

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:12,799
so julia python and r

00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:15,360
and like i mentioned uh project jupiter

00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:17,280
was spun off by python by fernando perez

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,280
it included the notebook interface as

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,440
well as other language agnostic parts of

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,000
ipython

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,760
so coming to project jupiter this brings

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,919
us to the present

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,760
and i wanted to talk about a few key

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,679
trends that i see

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:35,200
driving adoption and usage of the

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:37,200
jupiter notebook today and these trends

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,400
are data science and machine learning

00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,880
sharing and interaction

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,159
and growing ecosystem around notebook

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,559
tools

00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:46,240
so this one again might be one you're

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,600
familiar with you might even be here

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,840
because you work on

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,720
data science and machine learning and i

00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,840
think one

00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,360
kind of thing that highlights how this

00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:59,440
is driven adoption and usage of the

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,440
notebook is a tool called google colab

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,440
basically it is a notebook in the cloud

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,919
that you can

00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:07,679
open up uh you can use it with google

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,240
drive and a key point is

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,080
you can actually use it to access free

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:16,080
gpu and tpu

00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:18,240
computation so this has been a very

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,760
become a very popular tool for machine

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,200
learning researchers

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,480
and i think that's part of a broader

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,720
trend of hosted solutions or notebook as

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,280
an

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,600
interface to specialize computation so

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,280
the colab lets you connect to gpus and

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,240
tpus

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:36,240
aws has a similar offering sagemaker and

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,200
notebooks are also very popular

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,760
uh part of sagemaker the competition

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,960
platform

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,280
kaggle lets you also spin up notebooks

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,679
and

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,760
run computations on their platform uh

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,760
and so this is kind of a logical

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,120
uh conclusion of this separation of the

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,600
front end and the kernel

00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,679
um where now the front end can just be

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,799
on my laptop and the kernel can actually

00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,679
be executing

00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,240
say in one of google's data centers um

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,120
on

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,400
a specialized device so i think this is

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,840
a really cool use

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,600
of notebooks and one that's seeing

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,799
increased adoption

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,520
and even in things that i work on we use

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,720
kubeflow

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,480
as a platform for uh machine learning in

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,159
kubernetes and

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,000
it contains a bunch of functionality for

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,600
machine learning like things like

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,200
machine learning pipelines and hyper

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,320
parameter tuning and distributed

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,240
execution

00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,240
all sorts of things model serving but

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,600
the one functionality that actually

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,400
drives the most use

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:33,120
of kubeflow is a hosted notebook server

00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,679
so

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,000
um it's a really key part of these

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:41,360
machine learning use cases today

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:43,840
another key area i think that is

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,280
driving a lot of tools today is sharing

00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,440
an interaction

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,960
a really important one in that area is

00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:53,360
binder and this is a super cool tool

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,120
basically it allows you to take a git

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,840
repo

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,840
it bundles the dependencies of your repo

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,320
into a docker container and then spins

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,919
up

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,600
a version of your notebook that someone

00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,480
else can run

00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,120
from their own browser and so this goes

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,559
from

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,200
notebooks being something that i could

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:13,600
execute on my machine maybe i can share

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,280
the document with you but now this is

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,720
kind of another step further it makes it

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,559
really easy to say

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:22,080
i can give you your i can give you my

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:25,280
notebook and allow you to run it

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,080
another kind of tool in that area is

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,919
voila

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,360
and this is saying i want to take my

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,720
notebook and turn it into a web

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,480
application

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,240
just from the notebook itself with

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,480
interactive components

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,799
and so this is another really cool tool

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,400
and finally ipi widgets so i was at the

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,799
scipy conference recently

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,840
there was a whole tutorial on these ipi

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,159
widgets

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,760
they're interactive html widgets for

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,200
jupyter notebooks and it makes it really

00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,159
easy to share with people

00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,840
and again like bring external

00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,279
interactivity to your notebook it's not

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:56,960
just something that you can code

00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,640
interactively it's something that

00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,000
once you're done other people can also

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,640
interact with and

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,240
finally a growing ecosystem and so like

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,480
i mentioned it started out supporting

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,520
julia python and r

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:11,440
and eventually you see it growing to

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,799
increasing number of languages so

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,480
javascript php java

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,559
swift i think can even be run in

00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,240
notebooks now even

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,480
some of these tools that we talked about

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,600
before so sagemath can now be executed

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,120
in jupiter notebook

00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,279
as well as even the wolfram language

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:31,279
so finally the last section i want to

00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:32,000
consider some points about the future of

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,279
the jupiter notebook

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,720
so where where it may be going

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,640
and the major trends here i think are

00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,440
around developer experience real time

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,360
collaboration

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,039
and productionizing i think these are

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,320
all open questions that are are going to

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:47,039
be solved in the next

00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:49,120
coming years so right now we have

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:53,039
jupiter lab and this was released as

00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:54,000
a alternate ui to the regular notebook

00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:57,520
that provides more

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,679
ide like features and i

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,320
i think moving forward we'll see even

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,480
more ide like features in jupiter lab

00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,559
as well as more support for jupiter in

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,080
ides so vs code

00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,320
shipped native support for jupiter

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,159
notebooks for example so

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,240
it might not have to be a question of do

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,760
you edit your notebook

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,360
in something like jupiter lab or your

00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,799
ide i think there's going to be

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,960
increased convergence of these

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:23,679
experiences

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,600
next is kind of around the experience of

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:27,520
using git and github so you can render

00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,440
notebooks in github

00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,440
it's a lot better than what you had to

00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,799
do before and

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,880
work on the raw version and

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,279
moving forward there's some very useful

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,279
tools so this is one called review nb

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,880
they can actually show you a visual diff

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,520
of the notebook

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,880
but this is not very widely adopted now

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,159
and i think there's a lot more work to

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,799
be done

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,240
around this experience github is

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:55,120
actually working on some of these things

00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:57,840
so github code spaces now lets you edit

00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,320
new jupiter notebooks on github

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,840
and there's also support for dropping

00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,159
links to binder

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,679
in your pr so you can actually send

00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,440
someone an interactive version of the

00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,159
notebook

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,080
another trend i think is being worked on

00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,080
is real-time collaboration so

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,600
um not just can i share my notebook not

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,039
just can i make it interactive but can

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,919
we actually work on it together at the

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:19,279
same time

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,279
there's a couple companies working on

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,400
this deep note is one to look up and

00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,320
then co-calc

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,640
which is actually started by the creator

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,480
of sage so he's working on

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,000
making notebooks uh real-time

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,320
collaboration

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,679
finally productionizing a really open

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,240
question even in terms of what does it

00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,919
mean

00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,679
to put jupiter notebooks in production

00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,080
so i wanted to share two use cases that

00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,919
i think

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,240
are kind of illustrative of different

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,600
approaches one is netflix they've gone

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,200
all in on notebooks

00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,640
you can read this blog notebook

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,320
innovation and netflix

00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,919
they're doing things like notebook

00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,440
templating parameterized notebooks so

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,159
you can actually run a notebook

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,919
as a script and finally scheduling

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,480
notebooks as workflows so they're not

00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,520
saying

00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,200
i'm gonna take the parts of this

00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,760
notebook turn it into a workflow i can

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,640
run

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,240
i'm just gonna i'm just gonna i'm just

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,760
gonna schedule my notebook

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,000
and you should look up open source tools

00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,960
like interact and paper mill

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:13,120
and finally fafsa ai so they wrote their

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,559
whole v2 library in notebooks with a

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:17,600
tool they developed called

00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:19,360
nbdev and they mentioned donald knuth's

00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,520
ideas of literature programming

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,960
so to conclude i think there's two main

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,919
points i'd like you to take away from

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,520
the talk

00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,600
first the history of jupiter notebooks

00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,919
is not linear it's easier

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,279
to present it in 30 minutes like this

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,640
but this is not the real story of the

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,559
notebook interface

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,399
the story is very twisted it involves

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,480
many timelines i'm not a great artist

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,840
but this shows kind of the interaction

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,240
of different ideas from all these

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,799
interfaces and second the history of

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,320
jupiter notebooks is not over

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:48,240
i present it kind of like this where

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,120
jupiter is the main idea in this

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,159
timeline

00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,360
but if you zoom out you can see jupiter

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,600
is actually one part

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:57,039
of this highlight extends further back

00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,760
in the past and

00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:01,440
into this unknown future so i would say

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,320
the history of jupiter notebooks is not

00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,919
over

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:09,200
it's still be written by you and me

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,960
thank you and i posted the discord

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,799
channel if you have any questions

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:17,840
and also my twitter so feel free to

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:17,840
reach out

00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:27,120
[Applause]

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,559
thank you very much very interesting

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,880
talk i

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,840
actually learned some things too i never

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,559
made the

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,720
connection between matlab maple and

00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,880

questions using this chord

00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:09,360
so i don't see any questions at the

00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,240
moment so while there are no questions i

00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,039
do have

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,120
one it's a little bit about the future

00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:18,080
of of jupiter notebooks

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,640
um i mean we know jupiter lab which

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,760
really

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,399
changed the user interface and there are

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:27,200
also things like adding more languages

00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:29,200
what you think is is the is the real

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,960
future of jupiter notebooks

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:36,240
or lab or whatever yeah that's a

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,520
that's a good question um i think

00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,919
there's gonna be always some people who

00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,559
prefer notebooks like even me personally

00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,960
like

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,320
i haven't totally adapted to jupiter lab

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,520
just because it's a somewhat an

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,559
unfamiliar interface

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,559
but um i think

00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:52,159
eventually especially some of the users

00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,600
who are coming more from an engineering

00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,440
background they're going to prefer

00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,200
something like jupiter lab as it

00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,760
includes more of these features that

00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,600
they're

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,720
used to in an ide so i think that

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,760
i think down the road we're going to see

00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,120
a lot more people using jupiter lab

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,880
but i think the notebook will always be

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,399
there it's it's simple it's easy you

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,360
spin it up you can run it

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:16,000
um so i think they'll continue to

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,000
coexist

00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,720
okay i see there are two more questions

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,760
unfortunately we are really running out

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,159
of time

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,880
so please i'll post them in the channel

00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,799
yes please

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,159

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,919

00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,039
moderate here so maybe i will come back
