that's great that's great

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,840
and uh i know that your talk is about

00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,160
road map to open source that's

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,560
amazing i think that that's a lot of

00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,680
people who found it very interesting

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,880
and so right now okay as you can see

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,160
people are coming back

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,240
now so maybe um we'll just get started

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,400
when you're ready

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,439
i'm ready and i'm ready to share my

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,440
screen

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,559
so right here we go i'm sure you can see

00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,160
my screen

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:40,960
and yes the today the title of my talk

00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,200
is road map to an open source artificial

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,160
pancreas and diabetes monitoring with

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,600
flask

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,320
and if you see a hashtag in here it's um

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,879
we are not waiting and it's something

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,719
that

00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,320
um signifies a lot um for the

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,600
diabetes that the do-it-yourself

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,800
diabetes community we are now waiting

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,359
because we're making things happen but

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,320
before

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,760
i get into the subject i'd like to

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,600
introduce myself

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,040
my name is diana rodriguez and i'm a

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,000
python developer advocate

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,880
advantage um i'm also a google developer

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,560
expert aussie

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,159
ambassador and microsoft mvp and

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,400
all those things actually mean that i'm

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,479
a person who learns new things

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,920
every day and i love interacting with

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,840
the community so you can find me on

00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,960
twitter at k2582

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:37,200
or you can go to my website superdie.dev

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,200
and yeah let's let's talk about

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,560
diabetes

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:48,720
am a non-hodgkin's lymphoma

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:50,399
survivor one of the side effects

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,159
and and also one of the things that

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,439
happened after

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:58,640
this battle with cancer was diabetes

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,680
it's also a well it's part of many

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,280
things

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:06,960
um when i first got to diagnose

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:10,080
i felt exactly like either

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,760
of the drawings in this picture it felt

00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,360
like it was too much to handle

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,800
it felt like i couldn't do it because

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,840
suddenly the responsibility of

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,680
regulating

00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,720
insulin for my entire body

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,840
was on my shoulders it was too

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,200
much information to process and i felt

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,239
like

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,680
i broke inside that

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,959
i wasn't going to make it before

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,920
carrying on

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,800
let's go over what diabetes and the

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,800
types are

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:50,640
very quickly so there are various types

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,280
of diabetes these are the most commonly

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,720
known

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,480
type 1 and type 2. um so with type 1

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,879
diabetes type 1 diabetes

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,640
also known as juvenile diabetes is an

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:04,319
autoimmune disease

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,920
where your body stops producing insulin

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,040
in my case it is still an autoimmune

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:12,720
disease

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,879
but it's um sort of type 1.5

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,519
and it's called latent autoimmune

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,879
diabetes in adults

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,680
there's also type 2 where your

00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,640
body produces insulin but doesn't know

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,599
what to do with it

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,080
and it becomes resistant to insulin and

00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,480
there are more types of diabetes like

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,519
type 3 when you get your pancreas

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,040
removed

00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:39,599
gestational diabetes and so on

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,959
and you might be thinking well but yeah

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,720
why all this fuss

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,640
well what's the challenge i mean

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,560
diabetes is a condition

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,680
yeah it's it's an autoimmune disease in

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,720
some cases

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,360
it's um an insulin

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,959
resistance disease in some other cases

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,200
and so on

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,560
we have many challenges one of the

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,680
biggest ones

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,959
um to start with things like

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,760
access to insulin and medication in the

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,319
case of

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,360
of yours truly i live in the united

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,360
states

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:17,199
and this is from four years ago

00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:20,479
but it's a good picture to compare

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:24,240
the fact that we have to spend

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:26,160
so much money for essential medication

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,280
access to insulin medication is so

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,479
costly

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,520
that nowadays people

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,000
die because they're rationed they're

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,240
insulin

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,800
they're raising their incident this was

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,240
in 2016. if i were to go without

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,479
insurance

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,840
i would probably spend between a

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,199
thousand five hundred

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,400
to two thousand dollars per month just

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:53,680
to be alive and i'll leave you that

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,440
to sink in then

00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,400
the other huge burden is

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,160
well we have a charts and a lot of

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,400
information on what the target

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,840
blood sugar levels are for people with

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,720
diabetes

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:14,080
right we're running an automated process

00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:17,120
manually with some guidelines and

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:20,320
and well what happens when you run

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:24,080
an automated process as a human

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,840
you make it an error-prone process

00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,919
then there's the fact that we have to

00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,440
digest all this information that okay

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,919
when you eat food

00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,280
part of it is made of carbs or

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,639
carbohydrates

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,280
which turn into glucose and then insulin

00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,639
regulates the right amount of glucose in

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,039
the bloodstream

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,479
when your body stops producing insulin

00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,360
on when it's not

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,680
using it appropriately then you have to

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,840
step

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:55,120
in and regulate those processes manually

00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:59,199
happens well um those

00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,520
ratios of how much insulin you need

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,240
to what amount of food you eat are

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,440
different

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:09,360
every person has a different ratio

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,199
and and those ratios vary over time

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,720
that's more information and it turns

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,479
extremely overwhelming

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,840
and then there's a fact that insulin

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,639
needs are different

00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,440
for everyone i i might need more insulin

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:24,160
if i'm stressed or if i'm nervous

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,960
or uh in my case i need more insulin at

00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,520
night

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,039
then in the morning and i don't know why

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,960
i have a friend who needs more insulin

00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:33,440
in the morning and so on and

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,680
and then it's the fact that it's too

00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,160
much and not enough at the same time

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,880
we don't know everything and we're truly

00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,560
never under control

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,479
you know like i said before when a

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:48,160
process that should be

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:51,680
running automatically is run by humans

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,919
it becomes an error prone process

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,280
and i know this is a long introduction

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,720
but

00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:02,240
i want to stress the ideas

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,919
the the basic concepts and the concerns

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,240
and the problems

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:11,759
that technology can solve

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,960
people if i don't give myself enough

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:18,000
insulin i can die

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,120
because high blood sugars it will kill

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,280
me slowly

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:26,800
but it will kill me um if i give myself

00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:29,520
too much insulin i can die

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,080
much faster it's extremely dangerous

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,639
imagine

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:37,120
the burden of knowing that one mistake

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,840
can actually kill you and that was

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,639
something that

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,560
it was um it had an emotional toll a

00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,919
huge emotional toll on me thinking oh my

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,039
gosh

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:50,080
if i mess up i can die you know

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:54,240
it took me a while and a lot of support

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:57,840
from the community to get used to it

00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:01,039
and i still have i still make

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:04,160
there are three main reasons on why i

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:07,039
took it to open source to using

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:10,240
technology for good

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:13,840
the second and the third reasons are

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,240
second community there are many more who

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,120
could benefit from any work i can do

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,240
um to help with this initiative the

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,599
third

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,000
well i'm a software developer i know

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,680
i can help others i know i can

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,520
contribute to projects that are already

00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,720
happening and i could inspire others to

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,159
do so

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:38,800
but the first one it's not even me

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:41,519
myself it's her i do it for her

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,800
this is my seven-year-old niece she has

00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,360
type 1 diabetes

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,920
since she was a baby and in this picture

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,600
she is

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:52,800
happy and super proud showing

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,760
her sensor and her insulin pump

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,880
thanks to technology she can lead a

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,920
mostly normal life like every other kid

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:05,839
um she can do things

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:09,600
that were unthinkable 20 years ago

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:13,040
or even 40 years ago

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,959
so although we have all this amazing

00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,600
technology that has evolved

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,640
it's still not enough and i'm sure you

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,279
might be thinking well

00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,360
how can we help can we have some more

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,720
context please

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:30,720
i'll show you basically

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:34,720
there are plenty of pumps and sensors

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,800
like the one i have here in the market

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,200
since i saw the problem of having to

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:41,120
prick my finger multiple times a day

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,200
to just wearing a device that is

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,760
transmitting my blood sugar values

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,360
without me having to prick my finger

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,959
many times a day sometimes

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,959
obviously technology is not perfect i

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,760
have to calibrate sometimes i have to

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,200
check

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,399
um those values but much less than

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,760
before

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,360
and also pumps solve the problem of

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,440
having to give myself

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,440
multiple daily injections but um

00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,959
your liberal has said we're never fully

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,760
in control

00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,519
the issue is that pumps and sensors

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,920
don't speak the same language and they

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:20,560
don't communicate between themselves

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:23,760
how difficult is that we need

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:26,079
that monitoring versus that incident

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,440
delivery to work together so we can

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,880
recreate

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,560
as much as we can and with the

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,680
technology available

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,800
the same behavior that a an actual human

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,680
pancreas

00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,240
would do and this is where we can step

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,279
up

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:46,079
we can use tech for good causes

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:49,279
okay two things were already resolved

00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,480
and and i want to highlight these two

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,079
initiatives

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,399
and then show you what my contribution

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,760
and

00:10:54,399 --> 00:11:00,800
yours can be the first problem

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:04,320
is monitoring and that is solved in a

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,800
really nice way we have night scouts

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,320
and again the hashtag we are not waiting

00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,440
we're making things happen

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,480
we're making things accessible night

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,880
scout

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,839
is a web-based continuous glucose

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,320
monitor

00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,040
it basically shows glucose data in real

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,560
time

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,279
and it can also predict blood glucose

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,519
values

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,399
30 minutes ahead using another

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,640
regressive second order model

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,519
then what knight scout does it's

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,200
basically a web

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,680
a web dashboard it's a server that reads

00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,160
from

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,360
a database containing data from

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,800
this sensor

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:46,000
or any sensor and then it has

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,480
alarms that are generated for high and

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,760
low

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:52,320
blood glucose values and it's free

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,160
open source software if you want to

00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,200
check it out in action

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,360
you can go to dianics.super

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,839
to see my blood sugar levels in real

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,720
time i don't know if they might be a bit

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,440
high

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,720
or a bit low uh when i'm over excited or

00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,200
nervous actually

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,959
here they are they're quite alright um

00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,639
but it looks like something it looks

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:18,880
like this actually

00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:22,160
that's um a screenshot from a while ago

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,160
so we have that great we found a way to

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,279
gather the sensor data

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:30,720
and to input things like

00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:34,240
the amount of carbs we consume um

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,959
to record things like if we're stressed

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,240
or

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:40,240
or things like sensor changes etc etc

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,240
and now we have the ability to run

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,639
reports with these dashboards and make

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,440
those

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:48,800
accessible to those who are monitoring

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,279
imagine if you're a parent with children

00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,000
who are diabetic then you know you can

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,040
keep

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,959
um things in check but what happens

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,240
the second step is automating that

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,440
process of

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,760
gathering that data and communicating

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,920
with

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,639
an insulin pump to make sure that we're

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,200
delivering the right amount of insulin

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,160
or that we're at least as close as

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,480
possible

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,920
to an actual pancreas and that's the

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,560
second problem that's already being

00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,240
solved it's

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,639
automating and for that we have open aps

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,480
which stands for open artificial

00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:26,480
pancreas system

00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:29,760
and it's a safe and powerful tool

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:33,600
it's easily understandable uh

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:36,560
it basically adjusts the insulin

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,480
pumps delivery to keep those blood

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,360
glucose levels within range

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,480
at all times so it communicates with the

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,040
insulin pump

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,399
to obtain all the details of all insulin

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,839
doses

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:51,360
and it communicates with that continuous

00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:55,120
glucose monitor

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,279
to obtain those values and estimates

00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,480
and it issues commands to the pump to

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:03,760
adjust the dosing as needed

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:07,440
exactly like a human pancreas would do

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:10,639
as much as as as possible

00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,920
um i got this quote from the open aps uh

00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:16,560
website and as of july 13 2020

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,480
there are more than a huge number of

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,519
individuals around the world with

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:24,240
um various types of do-it-yourself

00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,120
closed-loop implementations that we know

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,959
of

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,639
and this numbers continues to grow as

00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,800
does the number of options

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:32,639
for these types of closed loops and and

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,680
i'm going to explain

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:39,120
um what looping means

00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:42,000
looping is basically using

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,720
these tools to automate the process of

00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,199
getting

00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,199
blood glucose readings from a sensor and

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:50,240
issuing commands from a pump

00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:53,199
for a pump to do so automatically like a

00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:56,480
pancreas would do

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:59,839
with technology like this that is open

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:02,880
source and it is accessible for everyone

00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,399
we experience fewer highs and less

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,639
severe lows

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,440
and more time in range and that is the

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,880
ultimate goal

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:13,360
to have um a decent range

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,199
and to not suffer the consequences of

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,760
giving ourselves too much insulin or too

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,240
very

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:23,600
or very um or little insulin

00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:27,440
god nervous um and then

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:30,160
lead a normal life so

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,199
yeah i have my sensor i can see that in

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,160
my phone

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,199
i also have this web dashboard and it

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,880
communicates

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:42,240
to my insulin pump and i can make make

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,120
better bulletin decisions i have the

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,519
choice

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:50,160
to just um see the suggestions

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,279
and not having those uh commands be

00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,480
issued to my pump

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:57,839
which is called open looping

00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,079
and then to fully automate the process

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,600
and i have to tell you since i started

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:05,040
with this

00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:08,560
um all recommendations that were done

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:11,839
by by the combination of

00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,720
my blood glucose readings and my pump

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,399
has been spot

00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:19,040
have been spot on and i haven't had any

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,480
traumatic episodes where i have seizures

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,959
or where i pass out

00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,240
or i lose vision because i'm too low or

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,320
because i'm too high

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:32,480
or because i'm not in range but anyway

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:36,560
what's my and your contribution

00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,560
well we see flask in action

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,480
i needed something quick i needed

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,639
something

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,600
i could share and have others develop on

00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,279
top

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,959
if you want to add features if anyone

00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:50,000
wants to contribute

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:52,480
and i decided to use flask because

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,399
to me was the right choice choice

00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,040
because of its friendly features

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,160
the freedom minimalism and learning

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,800
curve

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,839
so you'll see two links there's a

00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,160
repository

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,039
and there's an application that i will

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,919
explain

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,079
i'm using flask with ginger for

00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,240
templates and materialize css

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,319
for a little bit of color and bonus

00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,360
communication apis

00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:20,160
what problem are we solving on top

00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,120
of all these initiatives well the

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,559
problem

00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:26,000
is simple we have all these devices we

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,280
have the dashboard

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,559
and and the alarms but you know what in

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,720
moments of crisis

00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:37,840
when i i never hear them but strangely

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,400
i can always hear my phone which is why

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:42,160
the idea was to make my life

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,679
and the lives of those fellow fellow

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,520
diabetics

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,640
simple or simpler people have the same

00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,559
struggles

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,160
maybe you don't hear alarms but if the

00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,880
phone rings

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,280
spot on right so taking advantage of the

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,320
simplicity of flask and varnish apis to

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,799
do this was

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:06,400
a good choice for me but how

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:08,799
so we have a range of values

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,400
and we have phones and we have

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,520
monitoring

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,160
so i'm using the sms and voice apis to

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:16,880
notify

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,400
myself and my emergency contacts of

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,200
irregular situations

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,120
with those levels so i grab readings for

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,240
the last 60 minutes or any given time

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,720
frequency

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:31,919
through a python thread with a scheduler

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,440
if ranges are below or higher than what

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,559
is configured through environment

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,440
variables

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,280
then it fires on alerts there's also an

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,080
alert if it doesn't get data

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,559
for a set period of time and in this

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,080
case

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,440
it's it sends a message to all my

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,760
emergency contacts

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,760
saying that my dashboard is offline

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:58,799
the actual solution in 3d

00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,880
is a simple flask application

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,840
that allows people to log in and

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,320
configure their night scout decels

00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,160
an endpoint to grab those readings and

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:12,240
the emergency numbers

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,440
to do so um he needed some protection so

00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,799
i used um

00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:20,640
google authentication and again

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:21,919
why flask because it was the friendliest

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,799
choice

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:29,280
for me i love flask i have to admit that

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:32,080
in here i can configure the entries

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,559
endpoint to grab those readings

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,280
my phone number to receive a call if my

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,080
levels are

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,120
out of work an emergency contact in this

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,919
case my mom

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,679
who will receive notifications should i

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,000
not pick up the phone

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,080
and up to five additional emergency

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,440
contacts who will be notified

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:54,320
should either um of them not pick up

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,120
one by one but let's have a quick run

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,960
through

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,760
on the technical details that made

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,720
developing this app enjoyable

00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,840
easy or friendly actually much better

00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,280
for our views

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:10,080
we use ginger as the template engine um

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,240
you know it's basically html in css and

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,480
we have a parent template defining

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,679
uh content blocks to be used by children

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,320
templates

00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,720
and these blocks will display the code

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:23,120
from children templates

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,760
um something that i like to also

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,559
highlight

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,840
is things like the url for function that

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,120
points to javascript

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,280
and css resources in a static folder

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:36,400
which is a very comfortable and elegant

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,640
way to point to css libraries

00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:42,080
or any scripts you need to execute for

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,480
your for your views your front end right

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,080
i'm going to show an example of this

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,760
with the login screen

00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:53,760
you saw before previously the screenshot

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:58,159
and if we see um i like how

00:20:53,760 --> 00:21:01,760
the content blocks i use we're extending

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:04,480
um layout.html so this is

00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,720
inheriting from layout and then the

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,640
renderer will load

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,440
what will load layout with whatever

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,039
variations we add to this file

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,559
and these variants will be defined

00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,480
within the blocks we see

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,080
layout for example i'm using the head

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,080
block in this case

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,679
and then well i kind of filled it up

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:24,720
with um

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,320
a little bit of coats for you to see in

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,200
context

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,240
if we go on the python side of things

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,000
one of the things

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:37,440
i i truly love about flask

00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:40,480
is the fact that

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:43,679
it is easy or friendly

00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,520
to read it's friendly to understand and

00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,919
it doesn't matter

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,600
if you're a beginner or how advanced you

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,159
are in development

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,760
um something to highlight about it is

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:58,320
the beautiful syntax for

00:21:53,760 --> 00:22:02,000
uh root decorators where you can specify

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:05,760
the roots and the method if applicable

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:09,200
and then write your logic so yeah

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:12,720
um i wanted to make this as friendly

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:16,480
as a glass of water friendlier than

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:18,320
free stuff but this is not even the

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,039
highlight of it

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,720
if you really want to take a look on the

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:26,000
new bitty grits

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,600
of the code i already wrote

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,159
a full step-by-step tutorial on how to

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,320
build

00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,600
this application you can go to

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,320
nexmod.dev

00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,559
forward slash night sky and you have all

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:42,480
the details

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:44,799
the most important part of this talk

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,000
after giving you all this context on

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:50,000
diabetes

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:53,360
and showing you a little bit of what

00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,640
has been done and what i personally did

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,880
to improve this community

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,240
and improve the lives of people like me

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,360
like my niece

00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:05,600
and all the people who are um affected

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:09,600
by diabetes worldwide

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,720
is our challenge we have a tech for good

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,880
challenge

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:19,360
how you offering head to nexmo dot dev

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:21,679
forward slash europe python 2020

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,120
we are basically rewarding your

00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:26,400
contributions

00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,280
for this application and it doesn't

00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,919
matter

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,760
your level of expertise or how many

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,840
years you've been developing

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,640
it's open for all those who want to

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:40,000
contribute

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:44,559
in this challenge we're asking your help

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:48,159
to find features or ways to improve this

00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:50,880
application to improve the lives

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:53,039
of those who are benefiting from it

00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,240
people like me

00:23:53,039 --> 00:24:00,320
so we have prices and

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:04,720
um we have um a number of

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:07,600
um indications and a repository

00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,840
with a really good documentation um all

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:12,960
the endpoints are documented

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:15,200
everything is laid out beautifully

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,279
and in the friendliest way possible for

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,559

come and see us we can talk about um

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,320
all these apis we can talk about the

00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,360
challenge and if there are any more

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,400

processes

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,360
and he has amazing information as well

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,720
there's also

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:21,840

i'm really excited to see

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,840
how can we as a community improve this

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,400
application

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,960
that i'm currently using and has saved

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,720
me

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:16,240
from quite a few tricky situations

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,960
and this is what i have for you today

00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,760
thank you so much for this opportunity

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,240
and i hope

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,440
that you feel inspired and motivated to

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,080
make things happen

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,279
and to use your knowledge for good

00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:31,279
causes

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:33,760
thank you very much thank you so much

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,840
diana is really good like he's using

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:38,000
open source using python to take care of

00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:41,039
yourself this is amazing

00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,720
and um so we have just like a

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,960
fifth question popping in so maybe we

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,799
have time for one or two questions

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,919
so um so one of the the viewers asked

00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,840
like how did you

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,840
configure cyber security for the app

00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:58,000
cyber security well it's work in

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,520
progress

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,520
i mean if anyone accessed the app

00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,679
um it's not like they can issue any

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,720
commands

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,960
uh like no one could kill us um

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:13,120
it's just information it's basically

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,480
entries of blood glucose levels

00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:19,600
and that is something that um i'd

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,000
i would like to see as the contribution

00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,600
on how

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,399
can we implement better security um

00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:29,520
we're basically just using standard you

00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:32,960
know standards as much as possible

00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:35,760
um so so yeah

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,840
so if if you'd like to contribute with

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,799
more authentication features or or if

00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,320
you have

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,240
anything else to contribute in terms of

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,679
cyber security i would love to see that

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,520
personally right so uh

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,200
there's another question so i think this

00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,640
is the last question now so like how

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,640
costly is the hardware

00:27:52,720 --> 00:28:00,559
um well

00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:03,600
the hardware the hardware is not

00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:06,640
costly or well it is in a way

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,480
um we have the privilege of being

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,840
well most of us have the privilege of

00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,840
being injured

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:17,200
um i would say um these sensors are

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:19,120
around three hundred dollars for a

00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:23,039
90-day supply

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:25,279
um we

00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:27,840
would basically have worked in a diy

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:31,120
community to find ways to connect

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:34,480
to the sensor apis or through

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,799
their dashboards dexcom has

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,080
a private api and we can access that we

00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,880
can bridge it to

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,720
uh like we can share those details there

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,760
are other sensors like the freestyle

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,960
libre

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:49,279
which are less costly and in most

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,240
countries in europe are subsidized

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,880
and there's an iot device that goes on

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,440
top

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,880
because the the freestyle library is an

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,200
nfc

00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,039
sensor it doesn't send signal on you

00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,039
know via bluetooth

00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,120
so there's a small iot device that you

00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:06,000
put on top that is tapping constantly

00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,760
this

00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,000
device and then we can connect it to any

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:13,120
of the open source dashboards

00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,760
um cos varies in

00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,840
um in different countries i think the

00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:22,720
united states being the most

00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:26,559
expensive of them all i'd say 300 to 400

00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:30,000
per 90 days out of pocket for dexcom

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:31,760
and around 120 from wow that was a

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,760
thunder

00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,960
from um for uh libre in the united

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,919
states

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,760
right so yeah thank you so much i think

00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,399
if you have more questions you can uh go

00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,960
to the

00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:46,960
you know the the channel for the talk to

00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,159
uh keep on you know the discussion maybe

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,480
ask more questions

00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:52,240
you know um ask diana or continue the

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,360
discussion on how to contribute you can

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:58,720
ask her

00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:58,720
