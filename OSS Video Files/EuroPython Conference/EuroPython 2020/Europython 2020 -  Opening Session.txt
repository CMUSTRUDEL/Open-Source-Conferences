okay

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,240
so welcome to the conference welcome to

00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,759
euro python 2020 this is our 19th euro

00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,759
python conference

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,279
we've come a long way it's the first

00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,680
time we're doing this online but we

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,960
still

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:24,480
sold over 1 000 tickets we have

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,039
way more people from different countries

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,199
we have 69 countries represented in the

00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,000
audience now which is i think extremely

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,920
diverse and

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,200
it's really a worldwide kind of

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,559
conference

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,760
we are up 40 countries compared to last

00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,440
year when we had the in-person

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,079
conference

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,840
so this is really exciting we'd also

00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,000
especially want to welcome all the new

00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,719
euro pythonistas so if this is your

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,480
first year or python then uh we really

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,079
like to invite you to enjoy the

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,920
conference and

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,600
we're a bit sorry that it's it's online

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,520
it's not in person but maybe that's

00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,000
actually a chance for you to join the

00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,359
conference

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,480
more easily we'd like to ask all the

00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,640
regulars people

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,479
who have joined europe python the

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,280
previous years to to help all the

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,159
newcomers

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,040
and and you know make them feel at home

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,920
because

00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,920
this is this is your conference right um

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,640
the conference is basically

00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,799
what you make it we can provide the

00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,640
framing we can provide the technology we

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,280
can do some moderation

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,200
but that's that's it everything else is

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,479
basically coming from the attendees and

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,840
so we're one big family

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:35,920
so i would like to ask everyone to to

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,799
help everyone else we'd also welcome

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,799
our sponsors

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:45,280
actually um i think i just did a mistake

00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,280
here

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,360
because the screen sharing isn't

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,600
advancing to the next slide

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,280
we'd also like to advance our response

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,439
like to welcome our sponsors

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,799
so without the sponsors the the euro

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,399
python conference wouldn't be as

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,960
affordable as it is

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,680
and we very much appreciate their help

00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:08,800
in making this happen

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,840
we have a sponsor exhibit on discord

00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,560
which uh similarly to what how we run

00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,560
the tracks

00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,480
links to the different zoom rooms that

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,160
we have for the sponsors so

00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,480
i would really like to ask you to stop

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,800
by and on discord and then also maybe

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,800
chat

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:27,520
with the sponsors using their zoom rooms

00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,800
they have lots of interesting swag lots

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,480
of interesting topics

00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,800
topics to discuss and it's certainly

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,760
worth having a chat with them so thank

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,040
you very much

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:42,319
for the sponsors and let me maybe play

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,319
a bit of an applause here

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,720
all this has to happen virtually of

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,640
course

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,720
which for for me it's a bit strange

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,360
because i'm you know used to talking in

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,519
front of

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,720
many many people and i can see their

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,400
reactions right now

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,280
basically i just have to talk into the

00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,159
webcam this feels a bit strange

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,560
um of course we we missed dublin right

00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:11,040
we wanted to do the conference in dublin

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,959
uh we what we decided is to postpone the

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,000
conference in dublin to next year so we

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:19,040
already have dates for next year you can

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,640
record the the dates already uh when

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,159
we're ready to start ticket sales of

00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,400
course we'll let you know

00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,920
uh it's basically the same week next

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,360
year last week of

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,680
july and we really hope to

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,680
see lots of you in dublin next year well

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:37,120
hopefully it can happen next year

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,319
we don't know about how covet 19

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,319
develops

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,000
which is the main cause for doing this

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,720
online

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,319
in in march we were basically set up to

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,239
start the conference to

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,440
start the ticket sales for dublin so we

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,720
had everything set up

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:56,080
and then corvette 19 got you know

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,040
in the way we had to cancel the event in

00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,799
dublin because

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,120
it wouldn't have been possible for for

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,879
many people to attend

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,319
it wasn't clear at that time whether we

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,879
could actually run the event because

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,080
it's a

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:10,640
fairly large event and so we decided to

00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,799
then do things online i have a talk

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,799
about this tomorrow where i will go into

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,799
more detail about these things

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,799
and then you can also ask questions

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,120
doing this online is of course a huge

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,040
challenge and it was a lot of

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,880
hard work for us we took four months to

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,639
get everything set up to work everything

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,759
out but

00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:34,160
we had a or we still have a very

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,560
fantastic team of volunteers helping us

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,560
with this

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,440
and i'd like to

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,440
show you a collage of all the the

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,440
pictures that we got from the volunteers

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,120
uh not all of them are on this collage

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,240
we didn't get all the the pictures

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,000
in time but uh this is basically this is

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,320
our team this these are the people

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,800
running the conference for you

00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:02,880
so i think again they deserve a big

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,880
applause so let's play an applause here

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,160
the europa's conference as you might

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,759
know is backed by the european society

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,600
which is a non-profit organization

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,639
registered in sweden we've

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,680
run europe for many years now it's

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,759
entirely

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,759
volunteer driven so no one gets paid for

00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:30,000
what we're doing here

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:32,800
everything is basically done to

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,039
support the euro python the european

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,840
python community we give out grants to

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,320
conferences other conferences and

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,560
projects

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,800
so all the proceeds from the conference

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,800
go to that purpose

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,280
everything is basically re-spent in form

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,280
of grants

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,880
so how will we run the conference your

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,880
python 2020 online is going to

00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,800
have to be run on a platform of course

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,840
we chose discord for this

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,639
because it offers you all the tooling

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,880
that we need for running the conference

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,400
discord is mainly a chat platform you

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,840
can also use it for audio but

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:14,560
we're not really doing that much we

00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,919
do put all the links on discord and the

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,400
links then go to zoom and youtube

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,919
for running everything in the audio

00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,880
visual and you know have more

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,680
interactivity

00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,360
what we do is we use zoom the zoom

00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,120
webinars for the main tracks and zoom

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,440
rooms for everything else

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,479
and we also stream the webinars the

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,479
tracks the

00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,680
four main tracks to youtube so can you

00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,680
watch those there as well

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,520
so how does it work i just want to give

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,440
you a very very brief introduction

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,720
so what you see on the right here this

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,720
is the discord window

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,360
you see in on the left part you see lots

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,720
of channels on the right part you see

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,599
all the people that are online

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,039
at the moment we have several different

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,560
categories in here

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,199
like i mentioned we have a sponsor

00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,360
exhibit which i would like to

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,280
point you to but we also have other

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,039
categories for the conference tracks for

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,520
the sprints

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,680
we have created what we call breakout

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,080
rooms so we have one channel per talk

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,720
that

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,759
we are going to have at the conference

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,720
and

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,160
that those talk channels can be used by

00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,680
the speakers to provide additional

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,759
information

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,520
and of course for you to to ask

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,280
questions in addition to the questions

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,280
that you can ask right after the session

00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,880
in the q a

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:37,039
there are a couple of things i wanted to

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:39,360
mention about discord um one is that

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,800
which may not necessarily be obvious to

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,919
people new to discord

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,280
you can click on the on the titles of

00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,360
the channels

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,960
the titles are i don't know if you can

00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,000
see my mouse pointer but it

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:55,039
it's uh it says welcome here so

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,080
the if you click on this welcome

00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,560
then um well not in in welcome it

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,240
doesn't

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,240
actually show but if you if you go to

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,479
the main tracks for example you can then

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,960
see all the links to zoom to youtube and

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:09,039
all the other links that we put in there

00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,560
so that's a very easy way to to go to

00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,680
all the sessions

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,560
um because we have quite a few channels

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,120
on discord

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,120
it's uh it's a good idea to have a quick

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,240
search control k gives you that quick

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,840
search so you can just

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,440
type control k and then you go

00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,479
immediately into the

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,879
into the search um because we're going

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,319
to have lots of notifications on discord

00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,240
i just wanted to mention that you can

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,000
mute categories so if you right click on

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,640
a category then it has this mute

00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,440
category setting and you can

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,039
you can click that to have less

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,919
notifications

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,240
very important i want to mention is that

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,920
we

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,680
would like to ask you not to share the

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,399
links that we have on discord

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,839
outside the conference so we want to

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,680
avoid having spammers

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,040
enter for example the zoom rooms and the

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,800
zoom webinars

00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:01,839
and we also want to keep the youtube

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,560
channel links um just within the

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,720
conference

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,760
because the the youtube links are

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,440
unprotected

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:13,360
and so you know lots of

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:16,399
people have paid for the for the ticket

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,560
uh actually most people and the

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,279
we want to you know give the advantage

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,160
of of the the paid tickets to the person

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,160
who

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,680
the persons who can who have paid and

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:28,240
not necessarily

00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,680
make things available outside you can

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:37,839
use the youtube

00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:37,839
channel for going back in history

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,560
um but i'm going to come to that later

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,880
on so this is a

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,760
screenshot of a typical zoom webinar and

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,000
the resume

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,279
room so they look very similar we're

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,200
using the webinars for the

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,399
for the tracks that have lots of people

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,760
on

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,399
we're using the rooms for all the

00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:02,640
smaller ones zoom is very easy to use

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:05,760
it's very easy to to get acquainted with

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,760
as an attendee you can use the um

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,279
the raise hand feature for example there

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,640
are some features in

00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,920
in the panel where you can give some

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,720
feedback

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,640
um in the zoom rooms you can also if the

00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:23,680
if the hosts allow you can also use

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,680
video and audio if the host permits this

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,920
the youtube streaming like i said is

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,880
mostly we're mostly doing that

00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,000
to give you a way to replay past

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,480
sessions

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,079
so it has this nice feature that you can

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,760
there's a scroll bar at the bottom where

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,399
you can go and then you can

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,279
go back in time so if you miss a session

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,800
maybe you

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,480
can only watch one one track at a time

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,120
then you can go back

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,560
and then replay that session this is

00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,399
only available for the main tracks

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,160
though

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,600
right then we also have a conference

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,320
back of course it's digital

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,959
because everything is actually this year

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,600
this is

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,120
a a page on the website which has a

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,360
secret link we're going to post that to

00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,360
discord in a bit

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,920
you can get coupon codes there drop

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,240
offers lots of free stuff

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,079
all the sponsors have posted something

00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,279
there so it's definitely something

00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,279
worth checking out

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,079
for the program we have a number of

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,399
keynotes five keynotes in total so we

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,640
have

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,519
a keynote from guido he's going to do a

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:30,480
q a we have naomi

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,440
she was the the or she is the former

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,079
chair of the

00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,440
python software foundation we have cedar

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,040
jessica mckellar

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,680
who you probably know as well and

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:43,200
alejandro

00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:47,440
the first keynote is going to be

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,800
sida ganju we are still having a bit of

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,639
an issue

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:57,839
finding her but let's see how that goes

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,839
i hope she can join in time

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:03,519
then we have of course all the events we

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,760
have talks we have poster sessions

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,839
we have a complete data science track so

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,079
if you're interested in data science we

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,240
have

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,800
tried to put all the talks that are data

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,040
science related into the period track

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,399
so you can stay in that one track but of

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,600
other talks

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:23,360
in in other on other channels

00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,440
are data science related as well

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,200
very often because nowadays lots of

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,320
things are happening in data science

00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,360
we have an open space open space is

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,519
something that where you can

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,120
self-organize

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,519
we have a hallway session the hallway

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,839
session is of course just a chat

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,360
on discord there's a hallway chat for

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,720

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,000
have sprints on the weekend

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,279
a bit more about open spaces open spaces

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,200
are entirely self-organized

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,200
these are basically sessions that you

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,079
organize and run

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,720
we will have a schedule on discord in

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,399
form of

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,160
a google sheet where you can then

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,639
register and then

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,760
you can you can you know reserve a slot

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,000
for you and then

00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:10,240
if you enter those rooms then you can

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,959
ask one of the organizers to make you a

00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,399
co-host

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:16,320
in those rooms and then you can run your

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:18,639
sessions we have two of these rooms

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,720
so if you have something to talk about

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,399
you can go there

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:24,320
we also have lightning talks uh

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,680

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,360
interesting very funny usually

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,839
these are five minute talks if you don't

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,440
know what a lightning talk is you can

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,000

manage to get a slot then you're lucky

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,199
because they're usually signed up

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,959
let's see how that goes

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,440
doing something like a social event or

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:34,079
after party online

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,560
we have a code of conduct of course so

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,079

this applies to the whole event if you

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:07,040
have a code of conduct issue then you

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,040

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,680
and then we can talk to you or you can

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:23,040
just you know talk to one of the

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,760
organizers to put you in touch with us

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,959
the people in charge are valeria sylvia

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,399
anderson myself

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,399
for the code of conducting

00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,600
right and that's all i wanted to say so

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,000
enjoy the conference

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,000
and

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,639
now i have to see

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:55,839
what my room manager has to say

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,199
okay i'm back again sorry for uh you

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,640
know being muted i was talking to the

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,079
room manager

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:21,520
so originally the plan was to have

00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:26,079
cedar give a keynote now

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:27,600
but very unfortunately she has not yet

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,799
shown up

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:33,440
and i'm afraid we will

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,520
have to skip this keynote of course this

00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:39,600
is not ideal because it's the first

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:41,039
um the first talk of the conference

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,880
but we tried everything we tried

00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,640
reaching hersh it wasn't it wasn't

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,240
possible so maybe uh

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:51,360
there's something got in the way

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:54,720
um i think what we can do now

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,520
is basically just wait uh you can get

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,679
acquainted

00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:02,080
with discord and

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,799
actually perhaps we can use this session

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,720
to

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,360
to help you a bit with discord so if you

00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:12,720
have questions about discord

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,720
please write into the q a and then

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,400
we can try to answer those

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,559
so there's one question in here for

00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,760
example

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:32,559
from um from simon or or

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,600
sk skymon i can't really pronounce this

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,600
sorry

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,679
uh it says is it okay to show youtube

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,280
links after the conference is over so

00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,400
what we're going to do there is

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,799
we are going to um we are going to have

00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:46,080
cut

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:48,240
videos after the conference

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:50,160
we're going to have a company do those

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,760
and it's going to take a few weeks to to

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,880
have them online

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:57,919
and then you can share those links

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,440
after the conference uh

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,120
we are going to have to see whether you

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,280
can share the

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,120
um the the archives are going to be

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,919
created for the youtube streams

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,440
right after the conference as well it's

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,720
rather likely that we're going to do

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,559
that

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,640
and then perhaps you know one of the

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,559
community members goes in and

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,080
as temporary measure creates one of

00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:21,120
these sheets where you can then

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:25,280
directly jump into the into the

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:28,559
streams so um

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:31,039
that's uh what we're going to do

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,880
let me see what else we have how many

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,280
countries are represented at euro python

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,640
like i said in the introduction

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:41,840
we well yesterday we had 69

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,000
countries represented which is 40

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,240
countries more than last year so i think

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,280
that's a very good sign that this online

00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,280
format actually does give us more reach

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,000
and it makes it possible for for many

00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,720
more people to

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,160
actually attend the conference this is

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,840
very nice of course we're very happy

00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,960
about this we also very happy that we

00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,760
have over 100

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,440
over 1 000 ticket registrations for the

00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,039
conference both for the conference and

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:21,760
sprints

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:23,919
so this has been a really good success

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,080
so it says here please mark explain that

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,280
the q and a are being held in the zoom

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,600
app

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,559
ah right for people on youtube of course

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,640
you cannot

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,000
enter any questions if you want to enter

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,950
questions you have to join

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,440
the zoom session in order to be able to

00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:43,360
[Music]

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,360
put questions there and then have them

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,840
answered

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,720
okay let me see what else do we have

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:03,840
everyone appreciates our effort that's

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,840
very nice thank you very much

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,120
so someone is suggesting here that um

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,000
if you have a second screen may be

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:24,640
useful to open the discord track

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,679
uh yes that's certainly a a good way to

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,400
set up your

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,159
your gear if you have a second screen

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,760
then you can have the webinar open on

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,159
one screen and the discord open on the

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,159
other one

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,240
for these online conferences it's it's

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,559
usually a very good idea to have

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,440
lots of screens so if you have two

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,440
screens that's

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,799
that's very good already if you have

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,799
three screens that's even better

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,799
another question will the passwords for

00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,200
the zoom conference

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,400
change over time or remain the same all

00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,919
along

00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,640
so for the for the zoom webinars

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:04,559
and the rooms everything is going to

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,480
stay the same

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,240
uh the youtube links though they are

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,720
going to change tomorrow because you can

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,000
only stream for one day

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,799
and then with tomorrow we're going to

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,760
update the links on the on youtube

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,760
for to the new ones

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:26,080
can you show some pause video with audio

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:29,520
in the process so we get less questions

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:32,960
yes we are going to try to do that

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:36,720
we need to figure out

00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:39,360
whether we can make that happen

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,480
because in order to show a video someone

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,960
has to be

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,600
running it and because zoom works by

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:48,320
using screen sharing

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,919
that could get in the way of you know

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,360
the organizer doing other things so

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,679
we're not sure whether we can actually

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:57,600
do that

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,600
but let's see how it goes

00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,840
okay any other questions

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,640
right paul asked that we thank all the

00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,480
the people

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,480
involved in the event yes i already did

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,840
that in the opening session

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,720
so maybe i can i can just share this the

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,720
the slide again

00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:40,880
let me just do that share the screen

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:43,440
so these are all the people um

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,000
all the people for whom we have we have

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,279
photos

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,720
there are actually a few more people

00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:53,760
the team is is bigger than than usual

00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,200
uh the team we had to grow the team a

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,240
lot in order to make the online

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,880
conference happen

00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,200
it's a major effort pulling off one of

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:04,240
these online conferences is not

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,799
something that you can do by using using

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,720
just

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:10,080
you know the the six people that we are

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:13,679
in the european board

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:16,400
and we thank this team really a lot

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,320
we appreciate their work uh everything

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,240
they did

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,080
but like someone else said this is

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,640
actually for the clothing session so

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,279
um yeah i'm just going to show this and

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,919
keep this

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,919
slide open

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,000
okay there's a question about the logo

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,000
so

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,559
the logo up here

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,159
uh i can explain a bit this is actually

00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,120
the logo that was designed for the

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,960
dublin event

00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:49,360
and this is because we always try to

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,360
make make the the logo represent what we

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,880
do

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,600
at the conference and where we have the

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:59,200
conference so the clover there is

00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,960
something very typical of of ireland

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,039
the harp that you see there is also

00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,760
something very typical for ireland and

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,080
the designer chose these two elements to

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,960
then

00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,000
you know represent dublin and we all

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,520
think it's a

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,279
it's a very very nice logo and that's

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,400
why we kept it for the online event as

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,720
well also

00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,799
you know a bit in recognition of that we

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,960
wanted to do everything in dublin

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,080
we're going to keep that logo for next

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,679
year

00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,279
as well so essentially all the just the

00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,400
time and the

00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,400
location is going to change

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,400
there's a question in here about talks

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,400
live or pre-recorded

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,760
we are going gonna try to have all the

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,120
talks live

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:49,360
um and not pre-recorded

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,640
of course we we can use pre-recorded

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,480
sessions uh

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,159
in case the there's a problem with the

00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,159
internet connection but we'd like to

00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,559
have all the speakers actually talk live

00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,080
because

00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,440
you know this is supposed to be a live

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,279
conference we want to have this

00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,480
interactivity

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:07,039
um and that's why we

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,679
we basically told all the speakers that

00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,840
we want

00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,840
to have them speak live

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:25,840
let me try to find some more questions

00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,400
okay there's one question about clicking

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,880
on the discord

00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,840
channel name so maybe i can just share

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,240
my discord

00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,919
show you so what i meant with that is

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,520
that for example you go to the

00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,679
say you want to go to the conference

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:50,320
tracks here

00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,960
and you want to go to this track then

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,200
what you do

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,159
here is you click on the track first and

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,799
then

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,559
up here there's a title bar and in this

00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:01,120
title bar

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,799
we have all the links and you can click

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,960
on that and then

00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:08,559
a dialog opens up and you can you can

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,559
see all the links you can click on them

00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,840
here

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:35,840
what else do we have

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,360
okay so there's a question about how we

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,120
set up things for

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,880
for the conference i'm going to talk

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,039
about that tomorrow

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,080
but i can also mention right now that we

00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,159
we

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,240
chose zoom we tested a lot of different

00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,640
systems and we chose zoom because it's

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,320
both

00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,880
easy to use for the attendees and it's

00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:00,240
also scalable for us

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:02,159
we had to scale up a lot for these

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,840
for for the conference because we will

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,279
typically have lots of people joining

00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,240
the events

00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,520
and that's why we use the webinar setup

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,440
for this

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,760
for the main tracks and then the the

00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,559
rooms the zoom rooms they can have up to

00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:20,000
300 people in the rooms

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,000
so that's that's a very nice

00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:26,799
you know way of working with an

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,360
online conference system we did not have

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,559
to have

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,960
a special setup it was just the standard

00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:35,279
packages so there was nothing extra

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:38,000
it's just that you need to you know buy

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:39,840
the right things

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,559
what will happen with the discord server

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:45,679
after the conference

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:49,200
after the conference we are going to

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:51,679
leave the zoom the discord server

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,200
open so that all the resources that get

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,399
shared and especially in the talk

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,600
breakout rooms

00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:59,840
we're going to leave those in place to

00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,559
serve as a reference

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,080
uh we are thinking about maybe how using

00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:05,919
discord next year as well for the

00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,399
in-person event but we haven't decided

00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,399
that yet

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:14,480
uh question sitter is siddhar gonna

00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:18,399
record her keynote session offline later

00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:21,520
uh actually that's a good a good uh idea

00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:23,279
so i think we

00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,080
we can ask her to do that and then maybe

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:28,559
we can share the the youtube link

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,200
later on so that you can then go back

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,799
and then

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,600
see that keynote as well the lightning

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,360
talks

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,520
then ask with how the lightning talks

00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,760
are going to work today

00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,520
this proposals can be submitted or will

00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,440
be able you will be able to submit them

00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,039
once we have the google form

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,880
on discord i don't know whether it's

00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:50,480
been posted yet but it should appear

00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,480
somewhere in here in the announcements

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,679
so this is the announcement channel

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,720
where you can then

00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:01,039
you know get to know about things that

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,559
we have to that we want to announce to

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,399
everyone

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,720
the way that works is that you go to a

00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,159
google sheet you sign up

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,760
you know very much like for the

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,279
in-person event where you just you put

00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,600
your name you put the title

00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,440
and then we have a number of slots

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,039
available and then after

00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,600
all the slots are filled it's filled and

00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:25,039
then you can try again next

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:25,039
next day the session is later today

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:31,360
um next question do you have some live

00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:34,000
tools providing how to disable people

00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,919
long subtitles sign language we

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,679
unfortunately we don't have any uh

00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,399
additional tools available to help

00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:43,919
disable people like subtitles or

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:47,200
sign language the

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:50,399
um there there are some some

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:54,559
uh things that we could use on

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:57,039
on youtube um i think youtube can enable

00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,240
subtitles but only if you know after

00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,840
after the

00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,440
talks have actually been processed by

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,519
youtube i don't know how good they are

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,320
the subtitles

00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,039
we have not tried to get this working

00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,679
with zoom

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,880
they added this feature uh in the in the

00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,360
last few months

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,240
but i don't know how well it works so we

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,960
decided

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,840
to not try it out not not have it

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,840
working

00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:33,840
right any other questions

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,519
here's a question here for the poster

00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:45,200
zoom sessions are these sort of drop in

00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:47,679
when you can and interact with the

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,399
poster presenter

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,399
the poster sessions are scheduled so we

00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,360
will have the poster speaker available

00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,519
in those

00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,519
slots and then you can just right you

00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,720
can just go into that zoom session and

00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,840
then you can ask

00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:06,240
the speaker anything about their poster

00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,240
the posters are available on the website

00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,279
and you can have you have a preview

00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,399
that you can have a look at and

00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:18,399
if you click on the preview image you

00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:20,000
get a pdf file

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,600
and then of course you can you can you

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,120

it will also be possible to ask

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,399
additional questions after that session

00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:35,200
is ended

00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:36,640
by simply going to the appropriate

00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,000
breakout room that we have for the

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,240

00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,480
so that they can answer additional

00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,480
questions

00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,760
okay another question what will the

virtual social event look like that's

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,360

maybe play board games or you can show

00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,559
off as

00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,519
you know things that you want to maybe

00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:45,600

00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,960
we can also do virtual reality room

00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,799
things

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:53,840
this is a bit up to you of what you want

00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:53,840
to do at the social event

00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:07,840
okay any other questions

00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,879
okay it says here that someone didn't

00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,480
have to enter the id

00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,399
and password for the zoom webinar you

00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,200
just just had to enter the name and

00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,560
email that is correct

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,240
if you click on the link the link

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,919
actually has the id and the password

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,440
built in and this is also why we ask you

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:41,440
not to share those link outside

00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:49,839
once you click on the link you can

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:49,839
immediately join

00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:57,200
um another question seats for the

00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:00,000
sprints limited

00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:01,599
actually no they're not limited it's the

00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,359
the only

00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:05,280
challenge that we have or maybe it's not

00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:08,400
a challenge that we don't know yet

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:11,440
we we have a we last i looked we had 13

00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,359
sprint teams who set up their

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,640
the sprint on the sprint page that we

00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:17,839
have

00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:20,880
and the challenge

00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:23,119
of sort of that we have is

00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,119
that

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,880
we will you know need to assign all the

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,720
sprinters that we have to those teams

00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:33,280
and we have way more sprinters than we

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,520
have sprint teams

00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:37,280
so if you have some idea to to hold

00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,119
additional sprints then please

00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,640
head over to the sprints page and

00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,560
register your sprint there

00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,800
and please also let the organizers know

00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:48,160
so that they can set up a sprint

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:51,200
channel for you on discord

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,119
and then we can have more teams right so

00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,119
we have plenty of space available we

00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:57,839
have plenty of

00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,720
of these zoom licenses that we are going

00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:01,839
to use for

00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,640
for having zoom rooms associated with

00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,320
the sprint

00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,079
teams the sprint teams don't have to use

00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,839
zoom they can also use discord audio

00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,480
channels for that so

00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:13,839
we can scale up to quite a number of

00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,839
these teams

00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:19,760
okay let me just check with my

00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:27,839
room manager i'm just going to mute for

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:27,839
a second just

00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,240
okay so what you just saw is uh me

00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:16,720
unmuting in

00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,280
discord and then talking to my room

00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:21,440
manager

00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:24,560
that's how we operate um

00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,720
right so i have a few minutes left that

00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:27,359
i can fill with answering and additional

00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,560
questions

00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:30,560
so let me just have a

00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:37,839
uh and just have a look at if there's

00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,839
anything else

00:37:52,400 --> 00:38:05,839
i think those are all the questions

00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:19,839
let me just scroll down a bit

00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:24,720
now there's a question here is it

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,680
possible to bookmark the channels in

00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:30,160
discord in order to find them quickly

00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,760
um that's actually a question i cannot

00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,920
answer because i'm not familiar enough

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,040
enough with discord to be able to answer

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,280
that you can ask

00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,599
jason though one of the organizers he's

00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:47,839
the expert for discord

00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:47,839
and perhaps he has an answer to that one

00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,040
and then another question here is a bit

00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,240
disappointing for that even few days

00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,079
before

00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,720
some stuff in the merch shop has been

00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:02,480
unavailable

00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:05,200
so i'm pretty sure that the

00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:06,320
merge shop will fill up the extra

00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,200
t-shirts again but

00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,560
because everything is run by spreadshirt

00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:14,240
we don't have any influence

00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:16,160
on on that one so um

00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:19,359
sorry about that you just have to try

00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:22,160
again maybe in a few days or

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,160
maybe next week

00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,079
another question the first talk 30

00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,960
golden rules of deep learning

00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,160
performance

00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:35,680
will be in this zoom session yes we're

00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,520
going to have a short break after the

00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,800
after the well what was supposed to be

00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,560
the keynote where they just you know

00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,560
filled with the q and a for discord

00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,839
and we're gonna head on and continue

00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,839
with the regular schedule

00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:57,520
okay i think we've

00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,200
gone through most of the questions uh

00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,760
