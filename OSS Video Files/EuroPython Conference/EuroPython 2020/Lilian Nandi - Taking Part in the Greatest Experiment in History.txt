	00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,400
okay it's

00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,280
um i guess we'll we'll make a start and

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,280
um

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:18,160
whoever joins can join yeah yeah

00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,800
yeah yeah um basically what i um you

00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,600
know i'm

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,560
i'm involved in teaching um high school

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,199
children

00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,199
and i've been involved in teaching um

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,880
well computer science and i introduced

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,559
computer programming

00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:35,040
to them um a couple of years ago

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,960
but the thing is that there's no sort of

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,239
precedence for teaching computer

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,800
programming

00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,680
and you know so i'm um so i made up my

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,800
own little

00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,600
strategy of how to actually introduce

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,079
computer

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,200
programming to them and i decided that

00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,960
i'd introduce

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,239
python to them um you know as opposed to

00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,039
say a block based

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,760
language or something because i i figure

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,719
that they can

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,480
learn python you know after all um i've

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,920
been teaching high school

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,880
students aged 11 to 18. if you look

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,360
at what they're doing at age 11 you know

00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,040
they

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,840
they read shakespeare they do algebraic

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,119
equations you know in britain they wrote

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,840
essays on

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,320
advantages and disadvantages of brexit

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,000
so

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,840
i figure that like you know at the age

00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,080
of 11 they can actually process

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,280
textual information quite well and they

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,880
should be able to

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,280
cope with python so you know student

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,320
introduced it and it was going quite

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,040
well

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,119
and um in fact i found the 11 year olds

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,759
better than the 12 better than 13

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,240
better than the 14 year olds so from

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,320
that

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,240
my take home message is that introduce

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,360
these things early

00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,920
and properly but then what happened was

00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,040
obviously in march there was a pandemic

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,479
lockdown

00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,280
and you know overnight we switched to

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,320
online teaching and i understand that

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,719
the uk was

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,320
slightly late in its lockdown and we

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,240
joined say

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,720
we were you know joining at that time

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,640
900 million children in over 100

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,840
countries i read somewhere

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:17,520
so this obviously meant this meant

00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,000
that um you have to re you know had to

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,280
we have to re-evaluate how we're

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,440
actually teaching

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,680
this computer programming to the

00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,200
children and whether we could actually

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:33,360
do it at all um as such

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:36,720
um it's a whole sort of re-evaluation

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:40,080
and you know so the first sort of

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,560
you know thing was a idea is can it

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,680
can this online medium of instruction

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,640
complement

00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,599
or even supplement um face-to-face

00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,840
in-person

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,720
practices which have been established

00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:56,239
and perfected over many years

00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,720
and then came there's a

00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,840
book and a saying called the medium is

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,120
the message

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,680
and it's a phrase coined by one

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,400
professor herbert mcluhan and it

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,879
essentially

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,599
means in this particular context that

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,640
each medium of instruction

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,640
will have its own signature

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,760
and it's accompanied by its own

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,760
strengths and its

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,720
weaknesses so you know what we should do

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,319
rather than

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:29,120
dismiss this online medium out of hand

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,560
is to try and discover its strengths and

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,840
and advantages

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,120
and to capitalize them and in due course

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,200
we did find

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,920
these you know the great strengths of

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,959
the online medium

00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:46,400
and i know and we found it quite um

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,120
educational now so what did we actually

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,120
um do

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:56,640
well the very first thing was actually

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,360
testing now what's happened what's been

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,239
happening

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,599
is that you know teaching python we've

00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,280
been i've been teaching them how to

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,400
write programs and they've been writing

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,519
programs

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,640
and every time they you know if you're

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,200
in a class of say

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,239
15 children every time they make a

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,959
mistake

00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,760
they put their hand up and you rush

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,880
towards them

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,440
to um to correct their mistakes

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,720
but and it was thought that you know

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,960
getting them to correct their own

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,960
mistakes is actually boring

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,240
and um it will mar their enjoyment of of

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,560
the subject

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,280
so the very first thing was to teach

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,960
them

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,160
how to correct their own syntax errors

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,080
you know if they're going to get any

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,720
satisfaction at all they have to have

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,919
working

00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:48,000
program programs so a few

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:49,840
uh very uh dedicated sessions to the

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,520
syntax error

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,919
and you know these um i had 11 year old

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,800
i had a class of 11 and 12 year olds so

00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,759
you know

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,560
wondering how they're going to take this

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,120
thing

00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,800
and you know they seem to be quite into

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,160
this syntax error

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:11,199
what to i think to adults even is a

00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,880
pain in the neck but to them they

00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,680
you know they seem to take it all quite

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,520
on board and so you know somebody said

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,520
wrote to me the most interesting part

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,199
was the mistakes when we made them

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,360
they could have been minor but they made

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,320
such a difference it was

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,479
interesting to see how that counted how

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,199
and how intricate a system that really

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,520
is

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,800
and another person another sort of 12

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,479
year old sort of said

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,120
i really enjoyed and basically talk

00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,360
talking about the syntax error here you

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,160
know and this is a program that he

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,680
this person harry age 12 wrote of his

00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,800
own volition

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,520
and you know he's written a uh we also

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,400
taught them

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,039
about functions at this stage a a

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,000
function

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,680
which um has got playing cards and it

00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,280
randomly selects one

00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,360
it's made a syntax error and then

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,120
you know during the evening of his own

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,000
volition he corrected it and in the

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,240
morning

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,680
you know he's sending his code over to

00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,600
say that it's corrected

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:17,039
so you know the take home message

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,039
from that is that

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,440
they're perfectly able at age even 11

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,400
and 12 to correct their own

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,039
syntax error they don't find it boring

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,400
it only in a way needs to be taught

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:35,759
and it can actually be taught online

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:39,039
then we move on to um

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,639
okay development now

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,880
obviously if they're going to produce

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,840
anything useful they're going to have to

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,960
learn about

00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,759
functions and modules kind of thing

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,240
um would previously thought that this is

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,240
a

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:56,400
tough topic and you have to obviously be

00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,919
in the classroom to teach this but

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,160
nevertheless

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,440
um you know want them to do something

00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,800
pretty useful

00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:07,520
so you know we talk them about functions

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,400
with first of all a worked example of a

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,800
function

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,000
adding two numbers and passing in

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,280
information

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,280
and then getting them to

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,520
create their own functions as such and

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,440
then we also showed them

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:28,000
a function of um generating sort of

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,000
random passwords and asking them to

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:35,759
modify it for their own sort of purposes

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,319
now actually they

00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,280
managed to grasp the concept of

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,000
functions

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:44,080
quite quickly and when thinking about it

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,960
why shouldn't they really because at the

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,879
ages of five

00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:51,520
six and seven they they read paragraphs

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,240
and they're quite used to processing

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,280
blocks of

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,240
information so a function is a block of

00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,800
information

00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,319
so there's in a way no reason in that

00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,639
sense why they shouldn't

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,680
and they were quite enjoying it as well

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,280
and one

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,680
little boy alex hd11 wrote i enjoyed

00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,160
learning about functions and how to

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,639
define them so you could access them at

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,000
any

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:19,360
moment then

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:24,080
you know what else can we do which is

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:26,160
meaningful and useful and

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,160
so we introduced them to this the

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,639
concept of modeling and

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,680
simulation and we could introduce this

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,800
in the cons

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,399
in the context of the kovid 19 forecasts

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,159
which have arisen as a result of

00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:42,159
modeling and simulation

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:45,360
and we showed them the um of the papers

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:47,839
and there's even code on github um

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,279
python code about this as well to show

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,160
that the python language

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,640
has actually played an important very uh

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,160
role

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,560
in all of this and

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,000
graphs are integral to modeling and

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,279
simulation so we showed

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,839
how you can create graphs now when you

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,240
create graphs perhaps there's an

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,120
extra layer of complexity to this type

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,560
of function

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,600
in that we have an external file and

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:18,880
you know so they have to now know how

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:22,080
two files can work together to produce a

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:25,040
graph as such and

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,160
you know we gave them sort of um worked

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,240
examples of

00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,600
temperatures in different countries and

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:34,080
then we asked them to

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:37,279
um create their own uh sort of

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,080
graph code and this point this girl here

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,360
siobhan age

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:44,399
13 she put in fibonacci numbers

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,800
and you know managed to produce a plot

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,959
so here now we've got a function we've

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,240
got extra complexities of an

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,720
extra external file here and

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,399
it's creating a graph and again you know

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,440
we we managed to do this

00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,680
um online now as we would as i was

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,560
teaching online

00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:06,399
i you don't really know what tools are

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,880
out there as such

00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:13,839
but we discovered say um online editors

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,560
one called repple where you can write

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,880
code you can

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,000
share code you can take over somebody's

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,959
screen and correct

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,839
code with making and then we're making

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,000
heavy use

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:25,600
of the chat functionality in the

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,360
microsoft teams

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:32,959
to share

00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,839
to pass code to from each other so

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,680
when you wanted to do something you know

00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,720
you looked for the tools

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,880
and the tools seem to be appearing

00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,279
now of course having said that i think

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,480
we're very much in the infancy of online

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,399
teaching and learning

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,920
and we're also you know we're very much

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:53,200
i think in version

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:58,079
one but having said that what we have

00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:00,800
we can do a great deal with um

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,120
you know the children seem to enjoy this

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,959
uh

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,399
one little boy kept saying will you tell

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,440
my parents

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,800
every time he had a working program a

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,920
little girl sort of

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,000
said oh you know i've written a program

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,120
to generate a passcode a random

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,320
passcode of six digits

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,760
and you know there's a lot of discussion

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,040
that can take place in an

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:28,560
online medium which can't you can't in a

00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:32,160
um face-to-face classroom as such

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:35,279
um so you know some somebody was asking

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:38,720
what programming language is excel

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:41,200
written in and every and because

00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:42,399
this online medium every time somebody

00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,160
showed their program

00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:49,760
i think everybody was looking up to see

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:52,399
what you know what was being done so

00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,480
the conclusions are accessing the power

00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,200
and the motivating power of online

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,920
teaching

00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,480
i think when properly done are enormous

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:04,160
and it's a great privilege to partake in

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:06,399
in this um it's very exciting to take

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,240
part in a field which is in its infancy

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,560
and rapidly developing

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,079
and you know we look forward to the day

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,800
when everybody can

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,639
enjoy these experiences and i think

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,920
we'll look back on this time

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,279
and think of it as uh you know one of

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,560
the greatest experience

00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:27,519
experience of of mankind ever and also

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,720
in the field of online learning um i

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,639
have a youtube channel

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:35,040
called lil anonymous um which has got

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,560
computer science videos and videos on

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,880
programming as well

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,920
a website that i've created for my

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,000
students

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:47,200
and uh this is my email address yeah

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,360
so uh i've got a talk

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:54,880
also tomorrow in microsoft room from

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:58,399
145 to 215

00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:01,760
which you know explains a lot more um

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,639
yeah so what would you like to say any

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,240
comments or

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:08,079
any questions or anything um

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,160
yeah well first of all thanks thanks

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,880
very much for presenting i see that

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,160
there's there's

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:17,760
one other guy here now um

00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,600
i just wanted to ask the so have you

00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,040
developed this curriculum

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,279
by yourself um and also

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,720
how does it work specifically in the uk

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,639
do they have

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,639
do they have i know in south africa

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,320
we've got information technology but

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,360
it's only available

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,760
um from grades 10 to 12 is

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,360
is your your thing i mean you spoke at

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,959
the very beginning about

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,399
you know teaching them as young as

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,399
possible

00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,839
how do you basically develop the system

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,639
to to teach them as young as possible

00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,440
yeah i mean

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,079
maybe available that's right i mean what

00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,880
we have

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,279
in the uk is that we have a system there

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,160
is an

00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,800
intention let's say to teach computer

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,079
science

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,560
from the kindergarten age and you know

00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,040
that

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,519
there are various documents about this

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,000
now the documents are written in a very

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,000
um

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,880
for want of a better word loose fashion

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,800
so you know there's a there's an

00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,240
intention that they should learn

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,000
how to program um and

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,360
and there's a lot of other things in the

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,800
document as well

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,480
about what they should learn about

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:36,720
technology and computer science as well

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:39,920
so um everybody probably

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,240
does things very differently there's

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,480
you know in other subjects maybe says

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,959
maths latin english they've been going

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,440
for longer so there's a uniformity about

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,720
it

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:53,279
in how people do this so um

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,079
and there's you know and because it's so

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,920
new

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,839
probably people do things differently

00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,680
and there's a lot of flexibility

00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:04,560
allowed in how you do this so my

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,040
school of thought was i would like to

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,040
learn

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,160
i would like them to learn how to

00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,160
program

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:15,279
and um

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,000
you know a lot of people think that they

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,600
should

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,360
you know they're too young to learn at

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:24,480
age 11 and they start them off at age

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,680
15 when they start doing their enroll

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,399
for their courses

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,839
but you know then i experimented and

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,160
taught the 11 year olds

00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,600
and indeed we found i found that they

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,320
are a lot better

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,399
when you introduce these things than you

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,880
introduce it at age 15.

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:42,720
we come to the conclusion or coming

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,120
rapidly coming to the conclusion it's

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,720
like

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,040
music or learning language or learning

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,320
sport or something when you introduce

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,320
these things younger

00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:57,600
they seem to learn these things sort of

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,040
better so i have 11 to 18 year olds on

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,680
my plate so i've introduced

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,560
at age 11. my guess is that you can

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,199
introduce it

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,959
at age eight as well and with a few

00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:09,920
family friends i have actually

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,680
you know on occasion introduced a bit of

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,920
python to them when i get over

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,680
age eight and they are very good at it

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,800
so um yeah

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,920
trying to develop this so that it you

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,279
know says

00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:25,680
so that it can appeal um to

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:26,399
we can introduce it a lot younger and

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,839
also

00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:33,920
what we or what what we've been finding

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,639
is that the young children they do not

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,000
mind say

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,480
arithmetic examples or hard examples as

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,480
such

00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,560
they don't need to be basic they don't

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,759
need to necessarily be

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,320
kept amused with games or something

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,199
they're very happy with textual

00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,399
arithmetic

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:54,160
examples so you can start them off

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,079
you know if you my guess is that if you

00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:00,000
start them off quite early

00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:03,279
very soon they'll be quite proficient

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,439
and probably what's currently taught

00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:08,079
at older age groups can be brought down

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,079
a lot lower

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:15,039
yeah i mean i think that's it's pretty

00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,919
prevalent because

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:19,199
the the younger age troops i guess i'm

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,360
kind of looking at

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,039
like they're eager to learn they don't

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,199
know what they want to learn

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,880
but they're very eager to learn and just

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,960
develop and also you know

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,919
the emergence of technology all around

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,720
us and

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,760
kids are playing games 23 hours a day

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,080
these days

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,120
and they want to know how these things

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,440
are

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,400
are developed or even the grassroots of

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,440
them and then maybe at 15 years old 16

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,600
years old

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,720
these kids they maybe have a bit of an

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,720
ego about it

00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,720
um just like you were saying that the

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,240
younger kid don't necessarily mind

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:56,559
a difficult task um

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,840
maybe maybe the younger kids they

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:02,240
welcome it and then the older kids

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,039
they might like take a knock to their

00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,360
ego or

00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:08,400
they might give up on it quite quickly

00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:11,440
[Music]

00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:15,360
yeah exactly i mean you find that the

00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:17,760
the younger children go easily give up

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,360
they've you know they've got that um

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,400
something within them

00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,679
um that they want to do things and then

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,960
and also i think older children they are

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,360
they're pressed you know they've got

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,799
exams they have to do well

00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:35,600
whereas in some sense i found that

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,400
nobody is expecting anything from the 11

00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,440
year olds

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:42,640
and because they're left alone they

00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,080
produce an awful lot in fact more than

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,679
the 15 year olds

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,679
somehow you know that lack of

00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,000
expectation that lack of pressure

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,880
works very much in their favor where

00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,520
they do

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,520
a lot more

00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,720
i see other people yeah oh sorry um i

00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,320
was just going to say i i think

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,480
it's a completely separate discussion

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:08,160
but the impact that exams make

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:10,160
and and tests and assignments has a huge

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,400
impact on it because when they're just

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,160
doing it for fun for their interest

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,640
they're doing it because they want to as

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,320
opposed to having to do it to get into

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,440
university or

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:24,160
past the year or whatnot

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,799
i mean yeah i mean there are children

00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,400
aged

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:31,440
12 and 13 you know off their own back

00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:35,280
they are doing projects as well

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:38,559
um you know we're talking about

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,760
um python here but i had one student

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,480
who's

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,240
two students in fact you know they they

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,360
they do a lot of coding of their own

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,559
back in say

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,200
c sharp uh to produce animations and

00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,400
things

00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,200
and yeah they have the time maybe or the

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,919
freedom

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,400
or whatever to actually do that on the

00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:58,400
interests

00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,159
can the others hear me too i can see

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,760
someone called francesco

00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,760
ingo peter

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:21,840
is there anything anything you guys want

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:21,840
to say too

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:33,360
okay you're all on mute

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:36,559
yeah hello hello yes

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:38,240
um i animated myself now yes it's very

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,880
interesting to listen to it's uh it's

00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,000
sort of

00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,400
not my regular domain but uh i'm

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
i'm a little bit interested in what

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,919
young peoples are doing and

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,679
have some thoughts about it so it's very

00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:53,039
interesting to hear about your

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:55,120
experiences and what uh what

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,240
really appeals to young people nowadays

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,640
and

00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,440
and the approaches you take so thank you

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,000
for

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,120
for for this presentation uh i don't

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,919
have so much

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,240
to add i have some thoughts on my own

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,000
but

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,919
but it's very interesting to learn more

00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,960
about it so

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:15,840
oh thank you yeah oh

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,320
any any anyone else any questions or

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,320
anything

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:29,679
hi i'm francesca um sorry i've just

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,840
come so i lost

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,280
the most part of the of your

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:37,200
presentation

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:40,400
could you please uh resume briefly

00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,360
the the core of the project please

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,720
yeah basically i'm involved in teaching

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,320
high school student

00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,640
children computer science and in the uk

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:52,240
and i've i introduced python to them a

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,840
couple of years ago

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,880
and i'm teaching 11 to 18 and i found

00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,039
that

00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,080
well the 11 year olds are the best than

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,919
the 12 13

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:07,200
14 and this was going okay

00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:10,080
until the lockdown which happened in

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,200
march and so we had to resu had to

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,200
rethink

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,679
um can we actually continue even with

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,240
this teaching of their python do we

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,480
have to be there in person or show you

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,760
know what what should we do really

00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:28,080
um so we decided to actually continue

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,080
and see actually what emerges

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,000
the first thing you know if you're

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,799
teaching online

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,120
the first thing it was decided before if

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,880
they have mistakes or anything

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,799
at you as a teacher in an in-person

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,600
classroom go over to their terminal and

00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,559
correct it

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,360
so in order to for them to enjoy the

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:49,679
subject

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:52,799
or anything they have to um

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:55,840
they have to know how to correct

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,520
their mistakes so therefore the first

00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,480
thing we taught them was the

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:01,200
synth how to correct syntax errors now

00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,039
this was done

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,960
apologetically thinking that it would be

00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:08,640
rather boring or anything

00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:10,960
but a few dedicated sessions

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,240
they seem to be taking this in and this

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,000
is what they wrote you know

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,400
when somebody said to me the most

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,679
interesting parts was the mistakes

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,559
another boy here he wrote this program

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,640
of his own

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:27,200
back you know to choose a random card

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,159
here and you know there's a syntax

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,159
mistake

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,919
syntax there as he writes and he

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,960
corrected it and he sent it in

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:37,840
so they seem to embrace it this concept

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,200
what you know maybe people think of as

00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:43,120
boring

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:46,080
and awful they seem to be okay with it

00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:47,919
then sort of development you know if

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,840
we're going to do anything useful

00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,919
they really need to know about functions

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,080
and modules could you do this

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,080
over the internet is it you know

00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,000
previously i thought it's quite hard and

00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,200
you have to be there on purpose

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:04,320
but we explained it they seem to

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,919
take it on board and produce things as

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,120
well and you know here are

00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,480
here's a function by um a 12 year old to

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,440
generate a random

00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,039
password um if you think well if i

00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,799
thought about it really

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:21,279
at the ages of five six and seven they

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,480
read they read and they have they read

00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:26,159
paragraphs

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:28,960
so they're used to processing

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,760
information in blocks so there is no

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,880
real reason

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:36,080
why they can't understand functions and

00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,840
understand them quite easily and

00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,240
thirdly you know we introduced some

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:46,240
modeling and simulation here

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:48,559
and um so yeah

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,400
some modelling and a bit of simulation

00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,960
and can they

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,919
grasp the concept of an external file to

00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,760
produce graphs

00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,760
is it going to be too hard to explain

00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,840
for them but they managed and

00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,799
you know here somebody's produced a

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,080
fibonacci

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:07,279
sequence and they've done this

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:10,559
here so the conclusions

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:12,880
um i made was that accessing the power

00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:15,279
and motivating power of online teaching

00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,679
when it's properly done is enormous and

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,360
it's a great privilege to partake in it

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,520
and i think it's very much in its

00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,640
infancy we've

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:28,159
discovered a number of tools like rebel

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:32,799
where you can screen share and

00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,799
you could you can screen share and

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,960
you know take over people's code where

00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,039
you made heavy use of

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,799
the chat functionality and microsoft

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,279
teams and things

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,720
but i think it is version one and it has

00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,360
a long way to go

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:49,360
um i have a youtube channel if anyone's

00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,559
interested little anonymous

00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:56,159
um a website and a an email address

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:57,039
yeah so that's the synopsis okay thank
