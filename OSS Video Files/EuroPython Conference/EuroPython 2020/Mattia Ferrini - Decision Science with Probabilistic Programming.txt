By Mattia Ferrini

Generative Models are the Swiss Army Knife for the Decision Scientist. Generative models allow the simulation of scenarios based on different business hypotheses (Bayesian priors). With Probabilistic Programming, decision makers can simulate the impact of business drivers in times of great uncertainty.

Furthermore, Probabilistic Programming Languages provide all the inference tools necessary to identify the assumptions that have most likely generated an outcome. Inference is a statistical tool that enables optimal decision-making based on models that explicitly quantify uncertainty.

Generative models of key optimization parameters are necessary input to Robust Optimization and Stochastic Programming problems. 
Python provides all the tools to successfully integrate Probabilitistic Programs with Robust and Stochastic Optimization and therefore cope with high uncertainty in optimization.

	00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,920
i

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:14,240
if you can still hear me i guess

00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,240
we can kick off the discussions

00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,680
thank you all for for dialing in um

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,920
first disclaimer and this is the first

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,279
time

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:30,880
i am having a poster session

00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,920
in a virtual conference so um

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,000
we're going to be a little bit

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,239
improvising here it's

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,840
definitely different than just standing

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,280
next to a real poster

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:45,200
and having people passing by

00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,800
um on my side i am part of

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,039
the mathematical modeling and

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,039
artificial intelligence team of kpmg

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:57,039
switzerland

00:00:53,039 --> 00:01:00,800
and i'm based in in zurich

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:05,280
um and uh well this uh this session

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:08,720
is about uh the way we approach

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,000
uh optimization problems um as i was

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,600
mentioning before

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,200
uh in the past few years python has

00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,520
matured a lot

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,560
both from a probabilistic programming

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,960
perspective

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:27,680
but also for what concerns the

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:30,799
integration and the interfaces to

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,840
solvers such as for example grobbie but

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,119
also open source

00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,600
soldiers um both grubby pi and

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,840
piong would do a good job so i think

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,240
that from

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,119
a application perspective

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,000
our methodological approach uh is

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,479
becoming

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,439
definitely something viable there's a

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,360
lot of

00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,439
there's a lot less glucose that needs to

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,759
be put together

00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,320
to have a model up and running so i

00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,520
think this is probably a reasonable way

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,119
to approach

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,680
decision science problems in a context

00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,200
of a

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,800
high uncertainty um

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,599
do you have any any any question or

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,280
shall i just uh skim through the the

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,400
content of this uh

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:22,080
poster all right

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:25,120
i saw a sign of uh

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,480
feedback but are you able to to also

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,879
speak

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,879
or did you or have you been cut off

00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,280
yes you can you hear me now i can hear

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,360
you yes

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,080
yeah because i have to activate the

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,080
microphone

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,160
okay okay okay um i didn't

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,800
want to to make confusion with voice so

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,120
i

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,920
silenced it it's yeah

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,800
it's okay that's that's helpful um i

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,400
still want

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,159
i still need to get some feedback from

00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,680
time to time if i'm still

00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,159
still there if i'm going in the right

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,440
direction so please don't don't be shy

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,200
okay okay thank you all right

00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,560
so i think the feedback was if it's okay

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,879
if we go through the content of these um

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,519
this uh session and then perhaps if you

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,720
have some some questions

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:22,239
uh anytime feel free to interrupt me

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,239
all right so the idea is that

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,760
we are often working on optimization

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,840
problems and

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,959
uh optimization problems can be for

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,239
example well

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:36,159
find the optimal price for a portfolio

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,799
of products um in this particular use

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,799
case

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,319
uh we have helped the company an

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,519
industrial distributor

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:46,000
a company that purchases

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,200
industrial goods in asia and resells

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,519
them in europe

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,440
find the optimal price and the

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,159
definition of the opener price

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,760
there was a price that was maximizing

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,400
the revenues

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,920
um after the application of

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:05,360
transportation and storage costs

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,799
and um interestingly enough we started

00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,840
from the bottom

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:13,840
and we have built what is called the

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,079
company value drivers we tried from a

00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,199
modeling perspective to break down

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,880
their uh target matrix or non-star

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,840
metric i was also called

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,840
in some other context

00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,960
into its components

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,639
the optimal price is uh is the result of

00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,040
the calculation of the revenues

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,400
and the calculation of the optimization

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,520
cost of the transportation costs

00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:45,040
the transportation costs are based

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,600
on on a shipping strategy the shipping

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,680
strategy itself depends on some

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,240
optimization parameters

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,880
that include volume how much you like

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,720
transport

00:04:52,880 --> 00:05:00,000
when the lead times um

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,960
transportation and storage cost them

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,520
in in the setup the client had to

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,759
approach

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,360
different uh manufacturers that had

00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,840
different factories

00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,120
then she uh goods had to be shipped

00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,720
close to the cost

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:18,880
and from the cost had to be shipped to

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,080
um by by boat to europe to a

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,759
distribution centers

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,280
from distribution centers to rent

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,479
clients

00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,160
and the question was well uh how do we

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,680
deal with uncertainty and one way to

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,039
deal with uncertainty

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,600
is that when you're running an

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:37,600
optimization problem you have to

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,600
factor in information from distribution

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,880
of the optimization parameters

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:47,199
and the one way to define

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:49,680
the estimate of the distribution

00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:52,080
is by having a generative model the

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,680
generating model takes in some input

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,759
input can be internal data such as for

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,720
example historical sales data or

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,039
information about

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,199
marketing promotional strategy but also

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,360
external data microeconomic

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,479
for example the price of competitors or

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,840
macroeconomic

00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,880
you can have some macroeconomic

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,479
indicators for example unemployment

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,880
you can have some information about

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,919
commodity prices and there here what you

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,800
build is uh

00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,960
is a generative model that speeds out of

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,120
the distribution in this case of a

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,120
volume you might have a second model

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,360
that focuses on the transportation and

00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,520
the storage costs

00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:34,960
um from um

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:38,000
from a business perspective

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:41,360
then this helps because uh

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,199
um stakeholders become from the business

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,319
can have a look at these uh

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,520
the structure of this model

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,680
and somehow understand what how things

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,680
have been calculated they understand the

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:57,360
revenues they understand

00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:00,240
what drivers uh led to the revenues

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,400
they understand the transportation costs

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,039
what drivers

00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,720
led to transportation cost and this is

00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,400
one of the first advantage

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:13,520
the second advantage is that

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,840
you're not bound to distributions that

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,880
are

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,880
easy to handle analytically the

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,560
classical question but what you can have

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:25,840
is you can have a particle distributions

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:29,520
and then you're able also to to have

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:32,800
for example catastrophe

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:36,240
and rare events morally inbuilt in your

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:39,520
in your model we said that

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,840
the optimization parameters

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,759
are produced with probabilistic

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,599
programming

00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:51,120
i don't know if you are familiar uh with

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:53,840
the concept of probabilistic programming

00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,759
but the main takeaway is that what you

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:59,280
want to have is a generic

00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:02,960
model that takes in priors

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:06,560
in a vision sense about

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:09,759
the drivers you can

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,319
use some some data and combine them

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,560
to produce a distribution of the

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,960
optimization parameters

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,919
i guess one one of the very interesting

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,879
thing

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:22,479
from uh from a python perspective is

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,160
that the frameworks have

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:29,520
matured a lot you can have pi and c

00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:32,640
you can have pyro

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,519
you can have edwards there's a

00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:38,640
they come with their pros and cons but

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:41,680
depending on your needs

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,399
and modeling preferences it's it's

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:44,959
really

00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,480
a lot easier to set up and probably see

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:50,560
programming

00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:55,279
a probabilistic program for the

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:59,440
key optimization parameters um

00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:01,600
i guess also that the the topic

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,720
is is really interesting at the moment

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,040
because i feel

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:10,720
that variational inference

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:14,480
made a big step forward

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,560
um from a computational perspective

00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,279
the existing algorithms at the moment

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,320
are a lot more efficient than what we

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,519
had uh

00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,560
five six years ago and

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:30,800
debugging is a lot easier

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:32,880
uh modern frameworks come with

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,519
all the tools you need to follow the

00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,800
traces in the probabilistic program

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:42,080
so that you are able to see what happens

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:44,720
under the wood and debug things

00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,680
and uh once you have the optimization

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,720
parameters

00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:53,519
uh what you can do is you can take

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:57,680
your uh your uh your results

00:09:53,519 --> 00:10:01,440
for example you can uh buy a monte carlo

00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:05,279
get a an approximation

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,279
and then an estimation of the

00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:15,200
key optimization parameters

00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:19,040
and uh you can plug that input the data

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,959
into a for in this case

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,640
what we had there was a mixed integer

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:26,240
linear program

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:29,519
and from there you can calculate

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,120
an optimal solution we're talking about

00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,120
for example how um

00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,480
how we should transport goods from point

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,839
a to point b

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:41,200
and you can have a either a robust or a

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,200
stochastic programming

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:51,600
setup i think that uh from um

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:55,360
um from an implementation perspective

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,440
uh stochastic programming

00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,480
in visa with this methodological

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,000
approach

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:05,680
comes out uh right out of the box

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,959
it's also it's also if depending on the

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,839
number of variables and the complexity

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,320
of your optimization problem you might

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:18,560
also want to

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:21,760
recode your problem

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:25,360
as a robust optimization problem

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:29,040
by defining the deterministic equivalent

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,720
of your your problem

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,959
and one of the frequently asked

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,360
questions there is where

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,200
do you really need all these

00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:41,040
probabilistic programming to write

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,040
your deterministic equivalent

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,600
my answer generally is uh yes so you

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,800
need to get there you need to get the

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,240
feeling for

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:53,360
for example the first moment of

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:57,200
a of an optimization

00:11:53,360 --> 00:12:00,000
parameter so that then you can encode it

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,000
is uh as a deterministic equivalent

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,519
using for example

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,880
an analytic formulation and then

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,440
when when it comes to the optimal

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,680
solution i guess the things are probably

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,200
you realize that rather quickly are

00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,360
relatively straightforward because what

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,360
you have is the transportation cost

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,440
even the volume estimate at the given

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,079
price you have the price you have the

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,240
volume

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,480
you have a transportation cost and uh

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,959
there's not really a lot more than that

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:31,760
in this current use case but uh um

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,680
i guess uh the the exciting part is

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,120
really the combination of probabilistic

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,399
programming and

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,680
the robust or

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,680
stochastic programming

00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,279
any any questions so far

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:53,200
enough for me mathia

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:58,639
good um did i scheme to the content uh

00:12:53,200 --> 00:13:01,200
too fast no it's okay it's okay

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,680
are you working on visa on these topics

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,440
uh

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:08,720
you're yourself in your daily

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,279
business or daily life i personally work

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,920
in a

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,040
quantitative financial world so not

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:17,360
exactly that

00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:20,240
but uh i can i i'm interested in

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,320
in also this topic that it it is more

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,680
related to industrial

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,680
industrial world i guess

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:33,440
well i started off my career as a

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:38,880
quant in an investment bank

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:42,160
and okay i i transitioned out of finance

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:45,519
and i went to consulting

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,440
fine are you italian yeah you heard it

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,720
from from the accent i guess

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:54,560
yes yes although i am currently based in

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:57,760
zurich probably i saw that yes yes

00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,839
so we have we have a good team here

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,000
um we also have a few italians in the

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,959
team

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,519
we if italians uh at the moment are

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:11,360
everywhere we're spreading out

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,360
really fast yes it's true

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:20,240
cool cool um on on your side

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:22,240
when it comes to your your daily life i

00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,760
guess uh you are

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,760
solving a lot of uh

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:31,279
optimization problems in the markovian

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:34,320
sense right is

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:37,199
not so much because in actual

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,880
financial quantitative strategies uh

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,639
optimization

00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:45,920
it doesn't work as a expectant

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:49,519
expected or as the books said

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:52,160
say or write because uh

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,560
financial word is characterized by a lot

00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,279
of

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,399
unexpected events in a fat tales

00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,240
magnitude

00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:04,160
so optimization is a

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:08,240
is not so um is not so

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:11,839
uh not exp is not so cheap

00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,120
optimization from an an economic point

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:16,720
of view because uh

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:19,920
when you optimize for example an active

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:23,199
strategy in the markets if uh

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:26,000
inputs are not what you

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,279
put in the model results can change

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,920
drastically

00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:36,079
so we work personally in a more robust

00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,079
sense than an optimized sense

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:43,040
all right well yeah i think there's a

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,079
it's very interesting the conversation

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,480
when

00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,480
um

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,759
yeah well i i think one uh one one thing

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,199
that is interesting

00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:57,839
is that you you can get to the

00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:01,199
optimization parameters

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:06,639
uh by by monte carlo

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:10,240
yes or by uh by inference

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:13,440
and in both the bot setups um it's

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:17,199
fine to get uh to use uh

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:20,399
fat tail distributions yes yes

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:23,279
there are there was a couple of

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,120
use cases where we have in the

00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:28,720
generative model

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:32,399
we have estimated

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:37,199
a an optimization parameter

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:39,759
by having also a couple in the middle

00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,440
okay so what you have you have your

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,440
priors here

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,480
and then you have you have a couple of

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,399
models here

00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,600
and then you we were getting what we

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,880
were interested here

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,440
that then we were in turn feeding into

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,120
the

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,279
optimization yes

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,399
i think a visa the methodological

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:02,240
approach

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:05,679
um is really quite

00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,280
quite quite flexible um

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,120
my question is uh when when you were

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,919
talking about a robust

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,799
uh what uh what do you mean uh because

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,600
when i when

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,319
you say robust optimization i really

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,640
think about

00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,600
robust optimization but maybe in your

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,760
domain

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:28,160
yes outside yes because in my domain

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:31,200
robust means essentially that the

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:34,000
capital allocation so the

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,880
the capital that is invested in the

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,840
current day

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,480
in the markets uh is a function of the

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,520
current

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,799
volatility of the markets so robust it

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:47,280
means uh more

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:50,240
more a sort of a risk management

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,240
risk management

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:57,360
dependency or risk management function

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,240
in the sense that you have to you have

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,400
to

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:05,840
follow the estimated the risk of

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:09,039
markets the estimated the

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,520
future volatility of markets so the the

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,280
model

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:17,039
has to change um in the in this sense so

00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:20,720
robust means a a risk management

00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,720
optimized tool

00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:29,200
not a an outcome optimized tool but

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:32,480
a a risk a risk metric optimize the tool

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,679
okay i understand i understand it's uh

00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,360
it's very interesting

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:42,559
it's um and then by i guess what uh

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:45,440
uh yeah and and then if it's uh it's a

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,960
capital allocation on different uh

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,960
assets

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:54,240
yes yes for this reason first i

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:57,280
said to you the fact that the markovic's

00:18:54,240 --> 00:19:00,240
framework is not used anymore in uh

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,720
in applied finance because it focuses

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,160
more

00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:09,360
on expected returns but

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:12,880
the estimation of expected returns is a

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:15,919
the confidence interval are a very big

00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:19,120
uh compared to the risk metrics

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,160
so we focus more on the risk measures

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,360
the risk matrix

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:26,160
than the expected returns

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,720
okay it's very it's very interesting the

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,080
only

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:32,240
um i

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,240
i don't remember what it's called about

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,520
the last thing i did in between the

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,640
field that was uh

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:42,320
implementing uh some

00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:44,400
entropy portfolio location it was based

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:47,039
on the work of meuchi

00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,480
but that pretty much has as far as the

00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:52,080
things

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:56,799
i think it was even uh

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,799
10 years ago yeah wow time flies

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,480
all right is there somebody else in the

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,760
poster

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,000
you have a question please yes

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,200
um about their the structure of the

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,520
model was it like

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,240
did you design it in a hierarchical

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,400
manner

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,000
it wasn't like a linear combination of

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,240
um

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,120
the demand estimation and the

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,799
macroeconomic model or

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,480
just if you could describe the structure

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,799
a bit more yes

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,799
um

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,360
either in this particular setup what we

00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,960
have is really

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:36,559
a modular architecture

00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:40,480
where we have two models

00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:44,799
one is the demand estimation

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:48,240
where we we want to estimate the demand

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:51,440
for a product at a given price point

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,280
so we want to draw the price quantity

00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,840
curve

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,640
and that particular model in this case

00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,159
was

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,159
a an ensemble of trees

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,000
alongside that we had a

00:21:04,550 --> 00:21:09,200
[Music]

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:14,480
a model that was looking only

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:16,559
at the macroeconomic indicators

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,120
and was uh trying to estimate the

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:22,320
transportation and storage costs

00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:25,440
and that model was another

00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:30,400
ensemble and the

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:32,240
the output there was um

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,480
well on one hand we had as an

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,320
optimization parameter we had the volume

00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:40,000
that was the output of uh

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:43,120
the blue box and then we had

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,360
the the macroeconomic model that was uh

00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:50,960
producing transportation and storage

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:54,799
costs and the the the three

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:58,480
fed in in the

00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:02,480
optimization which is the uh

00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:05,440
pink purple uh box here

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,760
so that the optimization parameters in

00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,000
the mixed integer linear program

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,000
were

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,039
actually estimated distributions of the

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,559
volume

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:22,480
of lead times transportation and storage

00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:25,919
um i think that

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:28,480
all visa helps when it comes to

00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:31,120
understanding the structure of the model

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,840
and breaking out the things from a

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,760
business perspective is easier

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,679
because there were also different

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,840
departments different subject matter

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,960
experts

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:45,120
um yeah

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,600
and actually if i i think your question

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:50,640
is quite interesting and uh

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:54,240
um as uh

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:56,799
as a team uh we travel around and we

00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:00,400
work with different companies

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:03,120
uh we see that uh in uh across different

00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,039
industries from uh from retail to

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,280
chemicals to pharma

00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,200
we see that many companies have started

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,640
applying a

00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:16,240
time series analysis to them

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:19,840
to forecast things transitioning from

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:22,880
pencil and pen or excel to

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,480
to have some some models

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,200
uh some companies are a little bit more

00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,159
sophisticated they were trying to

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:33,039
neural networks but but the messages

00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:35,360
companies are now having a lot of models

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:36,799
built by different functions you could

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,880
have for example

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,880
uh functions from the commercial

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,919
department that

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,640
work on revenue forecasting then you

00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,919
have

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,799
manufacturing but focusing on cost of

00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,640
manufacturing

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,799
and now companies have like tons of

00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,840
models that are speaking out on a daily

00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,760
basis

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,360
uh tons of forecasts with different

00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,919
purposes and goals

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,880
so the way we see uh probabilistic

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,159
programming

00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:08,480
is also a way to combine existing models

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:10,559
into one big model that

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,080
builds on a value driver's tree so

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,960
articulates from

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,559
a north star metric in this case we were

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,760
trying to optimize

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:21,200
the price as uh revenues less cost but

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,520
most of the companies are primarily

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,000
interested in for example earnings

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,120
and then earnings can be broken down as

00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,720
uh as

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,000
p l items and then p l items can be

00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,799
further broken down

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,559
and in there in that by driver's tree

00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,840
with probabilistic programming

00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,840
you can combine

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:47,279
existing uh generative or

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:49,520
discriminative models okay

00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,279
makes uh makes sense yeah it makes sense

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,320
and um yeah i'm a bit nudest

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,120
i'm a bachelor student in data science

00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,840
so

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,799
um when you said the ensemble model or

00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,799
example

00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,720
structure um what exactly does that

00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:07,600
entail

00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:10,799
um yeah so what what we had it was um

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,200
uh whether it was either random forest

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,919
or

00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,480
some causing or random forest for

00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,480
example

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:24,480
gradient boosted trees okay

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,480
so the idea is that

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,799
you can have a one regression tree but

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,520
then you can have plenty of them

00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:36,240
and each tree contributes his own

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:39,600
forecast and then the model combines

00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:42,880
all these uh of the forecast produced

00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:47,200
by the regression trees

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:49,679
into one uh final forecast

00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,679
okay all right yeah okay that makes

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:56,720
sense to me thanks

00:25:51,679 --> 00:26:00,080
yeah uh i mean for a random forest or

00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:04,559
tree ensembles are really let's say

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:08,000
the swiss army knife of a data scientist

00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:13,120
in uh in the industry

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:15,679
yeah okay thank you

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,799
my thanks thanks for asking uh asking

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:25,840
questions

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:25,840
any anybody else

00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,000
yes i have another question sorry no

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,120
that's that's fine

00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,240
and it's good that you feel the the

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:49,120
awkward silence

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,840
yeah as i said it's the first time i do

00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:54,799
this poster session

00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:57,120
um you know in a virtual conference so i

00:26:54,799 --> 00:27:00,000
don't really know

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,240
how this goes you know when you are like

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,200
having a proper poster session in the

00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,440
physical your

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,640
you have your team there people come you

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,960
grab coffee and it's easy to chit chat

00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,080
here i'm just you know i don't want to

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,760
have a prayer i have impressions

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,320
sometimes

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,080
yeah i would worry i got disconnected or

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,760
something

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:24,640
sorry no it's fine i'm also a bit like

00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,840
new to this online video chat i normally

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,960
don't do uh

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,360
i haven't done too much video

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,840
conferencing like this i guess we have

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,399
to get used to it unfortunately

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,279
yeah but um yeah i have a question about

00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:38,000
the drivers

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,679
um because i am i'm also currently

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,120
working on an internship and i'm also

00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,520
applying um

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,559
bayesian modeling as well daisy machine

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,080
learning

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,760
but it's more like in marketing and

00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:50,399
sales context

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,080
so i was curious as to how you

00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:54,480
identified your key drivers it was

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,760
mostly through like domain knowledge or

00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:00,799
if you used um like a

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,159
uh you say a cartesian like cartesian

00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,960
grid search or

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,720
um how you determine the most important

00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:09,200
or most salient uh

00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,200
drivers

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:17,279
yeah it's uh it's a very it's a it's a

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:20,399
mix of both um

00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:23,840
let's say let's say that uh over

00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:27,120
over the over the years

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:30,240
as a team we have uh put together

00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:33,440
a a repository

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:37,039
a time series data store

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,520
where we keep track i'm talking now

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:42,240
about

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:45,600
external drivers so for example

00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:48,480
price intelligence microeconomic data

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,720
uh from for example sector views or

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,240
macroeconomic indices which you can pull

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,360
from for example a bloomberg or

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,399
reuters or capital iq so we have a

00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,080
number of

00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:02,960
data data sources we consolidate

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,480
the time series in a time series data

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:08,000
store

00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:11,200
we have a lot of them and with that

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,279
we have a good starting point

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:18,480
and then when um

00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:20,880
when we approach a new client uh we

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,760
we organize a workshop and we get the

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,520
different

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,600
different subject matter experts from

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,520
different areas of the company

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,399
and we ask them the question what do you

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:33,440
think drives your business

00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:34,960
and then if we don't have that

00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:39,200
particular driver

00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:41,360
we try either to find it or to proxy

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,000
and then what what you end up having is

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:47,039
uh is it it's a data store that contains

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,480
tons of uh external drivers

00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:54,080
then you have to connect to where if you

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,960
it wear erp system and what you do you

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,679
pull out

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,559
uh things like this historical sales

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,120
data

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:03,039
um at least most of our clients are with

00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,279
the sap

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:07,039
and uh then we have our data extractor

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,960
and the thing goes relatively smooth

00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,640
and then probably you're gonna have also

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,640
other other

00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,679
silos in a company where you can find

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,720
information

00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,960
about for example market and

00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,120
then once you have all these the

00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,480
question is uh

00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,360
uh from a modeling perspective uh how do

00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,640
you

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:31,840
read out the the signals that

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,880
uh don't matter or from modeling

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,399
perspective

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:39,039
there's also the question of uh

00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:39,760
if you have signals and signals don't

00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,559
matter

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,000
or signals go integrate or correlate

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,520
does this hurt

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,039
so you have to understand a little bit

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:50,720
the model you're using

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:53,039
and the handlebase of this situation

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,039
okay

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:59,600
i think what maybe if uh

00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,320
if you're looking at this uh the topic

00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,720
another thing

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,240
but i think it's very interesting from

00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,440
from my perspective

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:11,039
is the featurization of

00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:14,399
marketing and promotional data

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:16,320
so if i if you're just to spend a couple

00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,360
of words on visa without going too much

00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,519
in detail i

00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,799
what what i see is that most of the

00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,679
companies

00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,399
uh sort of like know when they send for

00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:29,679
example

00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:31,760
uh or start promotional campaigns online

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,399
but they don't really know from a

00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:36,799
quantitative perspective how we're doing

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:38,640
so what what what i've been doing for in

00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:41,039
a number of projects is uh

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,720
helping clients uh for example go

00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:46,399
through their email

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:49,519
campaigns or twitters or linkedin

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:51,760
and extract features out of that

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,960
one feature for example could be how

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,799
many characters

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,519
then there are like a matrix that

00:31:54,799 --> 00:32:00,720
describe the complexity of the language

00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:03,120
you can see online that they uh

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,399
how they are analyzing and comparing the

00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,799
performance or

00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:07,840
well the the complexity of the language

00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:12,320
used by

00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:15,360
different us presidents from trump to

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:18,039
jfk and uh then what you can uh you're

00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,799
gonna build those

00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:23,200
features around of a promotional

00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,200
campaign

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,600
yeah i've seen that also um like there's

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,360
some initiative

00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,880
in the company where i'm working to do

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,320
that but

00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,799
the problem is there's like not enough

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:40,399
data scientists

00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:40,399
so yeah there's a consultant

00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:45,760
yeah but yeah it's uh oh it's pretty

00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,440
exciting but i've also noticed the

00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,760
research itself it's still

00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,279
a bit i mean at least what i've i've

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,919
seen is still a bit um

00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:55,440
immature in terms of how it's exactly to

00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:58,399
to quantify

00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,240
the impact of these new um like any

00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:03,039
marketing um

00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,279
outreach you know for attribution models

00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:08,399
and things like that nature

00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:11,600
yeah attribution models are uh

00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:13,840
well one attribution model are at the

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,000
moment still an alchemy i think see many

00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:19,360
companies that for example

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,000
uh sort of like a random guess uh

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,679
with the attribution strategy that they

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,440
have in place

00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:31,279
first touch a second touch and touch

00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:32,880
uh with uh um yeah from a modeling

00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:34,320
perspective i think uh

00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,000
if you look at applying machine learning

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:40,320
but definitely a feed but

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:44,799
it's the for innovation yeah

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,799
and yeah oh sorry go ahead

00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,320
no i want uh i i thought i heard

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:53,840
somebody

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:53,840
saying something of the background

00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:06,559
no never mind sorry um anyway any

00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:09,760
any other question

00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:11,440
um hello yes we are actually doing

00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,320
something very similar

00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,520
in our company but from the buyer side

00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,480
let's say because if i understand

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,960
correctly this is for

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,079
the selling site like you produce a

00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,000
product and then

00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,720
to put the optimal price on the product

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,720
eventually right

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,599
um well in this specific case uh we had

00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,679
a man in the middle

00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,200
it was a company that was buying from

00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:39,200
the manufacturer

00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:42,480
and then uh selling as a distributor

00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:42,720
to a company that would in turn resell

00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,399
it

00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:49,919
so it wasn't let's say rather

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:52,960
not vertically consolidated industry but

00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:56,000
we have used a very similar

00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:59,040
modeling approach in uh for example

00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:03,240
uh la vision uh

00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:07,599
and the luxury where it's a company that

00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:11,760
manufactures and then sells

00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:16,240
b2c with their own stores and b2b

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:19,440
to stores that gonna then in turn resell

00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,400
yeah because what we noticed is very

00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,119
often

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,839
there is specific demands actually when

00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,760
yeah

00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:30,320
you uh have to get suppliers or so

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,720
for your current production but then

00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,660
only the microeconomic model is the

00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:37,810
variable input

00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:37,810
[Music]

00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,839
and was wondering

00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:45,520
the next step in the optimization how

00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:46,400
you use this because i missed that part

00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,480
of the

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,320
presentation a bit with the stochastic

00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,800
programming during the optimization step

00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,839
is it

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,400
kind of an iterative process or how do

00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:57,440
you

00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:00,400
really take into the model for

00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,400
optimizing these bayesian outputs of the

00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,520
machine learning from the step before

00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:09,280
yeah good point um so i guess uh

00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:13,200
uh you're asking what happens in the

00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,720
um purple pink box

00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,560
yeah because we use actually the same

00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,880
solver i think and

00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:20,960
yeah i didn't know that this is possible

00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,079
or

00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,880
how to do that oh we can have we can

00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,440
have a

00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,480
this is a very good good question and i

00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:32,000
think uh

00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:34,640
um i've been on my side i hope i'm very

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,400
very interested about the topic so i'm

00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,160
happy i would be happy also to connect

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:42,720
after this poster session

00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,720
but then there are uh um

00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:49,520
two different ways to go um so what

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,880
what you have is uh um as i understand

00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,200
that you are the solver

00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,560
that does for example uh this has the

00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,960
capacity to solve

00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,240
mixed integer media programs we work a

00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,839
lot with grouping

00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,320
i guess you have micro robio if you're

00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,119
not with grobe you're with ziplex or we

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:06,160
are with something

00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:09,520
open source um

00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:11,520
then once once you're there um so you

00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:15,680
you can start the with that

00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:19,839
um standard mixed integer program

00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:22,800
but now what you have is um

00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:23,599
for a your optimization parameters you

00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,960
don't have

00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:28,320
your point estimate but you have a

00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,839
distribution

00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:35,119
so one way to do to solve a problem

00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:38,720
is to encode the problem with

00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:41,920
robust optimization where you write a

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:45,040
deterministic equivalent

00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,240
of your of your mip program taking into

00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,359
account

00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:52,560
the um

00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:54,560
the information that you can extract

00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,400
for example the first and second moments

00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,320
from from the the distribution

00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,839
so the idea of robust optimization is

00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,200
something that comes from engineering

00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:06,720
internationally is imagine you have uh

00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:09,040
you have to uh to build a bridge

00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,480
uh it has to care be able to load the 10

00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:13,200
cars at the same time

00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:15,359
how do you optimize uh one optimization

00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,640
parameter is like how much weight goes

00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:18,560
on the bridge

00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,000
and the robust optimization says well

00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:23,839
you have

00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,440
a uncertainty set and the uncertainty

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:30,160
set is how much i expect

00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,160
is 10 cars to weight plus a safety

00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:37,359
the stochastic programming approach

00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:40,800
is uh for every

00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:43,599
um you can for example run

00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,280
a monte carlo simulation so you are

00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,000
approximating by monte carlo your

00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,839
distribution

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:53,200
and then you say sorry from

00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:57,440
from a optimization perspective you want

00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:59,760
your leap program

00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,960
to satisfy the constraints for all the

00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,960
points in the data set

00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:12,000
and if you like you can set it up

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:15,119
as in a way where constraints can also

00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,119
be satisfied from a

00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,000
soft sense soft constraint so in

00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,440
probability sense

00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,520
yes so you have a chance of breaking the

00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,320
constraints but then since it's uh

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,839
from a monte carlo hopefully the yeah

00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,599
most important ones you will

00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:35,040
most of the time not violate because

00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,040
there's so many of these samples

00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:41,839
well what you want to say or what

00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,880
in the robust optimization perspective

00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:46,079
what you have is

00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:48,000
um is a constraint that is a hard

00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,920
constraint

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,119
or on the uncertainty set in stochastic

00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:56,560
programming you can use your data points

00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:58,000
and then you can you can rewrite

00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,079
your your data points from the

00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,800
simulation and then you can encode a

00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,599
program

00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,599
where you can

00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,880
use the information uh on the

00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,560
full fully characterized probability

00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,440
distribution so that

00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,800
you can record your uh your mixed

00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,160
integer program

00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:22,030
in a way where you can have for example

00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:23,599
uh you can tune your um

00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:26,720
[Music]

00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:28,960
uh utility function on one hand

00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,160
and on the other hand side you can say

00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,599
you can also

00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,200
by having information on full current

00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:36,560
transfer distribution

00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,280
um set a constraint in a way which is

00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,400
satisfied

00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:43,760
soft satisfied so the constraints

00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:46,720
holds eighty percent of the time

00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,160
yeah yeah that sounds very interesting

00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:51,200
thanks a lot

00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:55,119
thanks um yeah it's um it's a

00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:58,240
and quite uh quite a broad broad subject

00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:59,520
yeah um i'm not sure i covered

00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,599
everything uh

00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,440
in a very very rigorous way there's some

00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,520
hand waving the way i presented i just

00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:08,960
was trying to communicate

00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:12,160
um let's say the big picture

00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:15,200
why try not to choke but uh um

00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:15,839
of course but if you like uh um this is

00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,319
something that

00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:20,800
i'm very quite passionate about so we

00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:24,000
can touch base after the

00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:28,319
uh after the session yes gladly

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,319
uh thanks a lot my pleasure

00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:35,839
um any other any other

00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,839
um any other question

00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:44,800
there are also questions on the discord

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,800
i'm going to look at them

00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:49,839
later

00:41:53,680 --> 00:42:01,119
hi mickey hi

00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:05,680
vijay here yeah hi hi how are you doing

00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:08,000
yeah fine how are you i'm fine fine uh

00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:09,280
it's been quite quite an interesting

00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,839
poster session so

00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,880
and thanks for dialing by the way yeah

00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:15,280
not to be

00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,839
comparative but another track is very

00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:21,920
quiet while yours is buzzing with

00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:24,240
questions another poster track is

00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,680
required

00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:29,599
good um good that's well um

00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:32,400
no i do really appreciate the questions

00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,400
because um

00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,000
oh it's been a very good good audience

00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:40,160
yeah matty uh quick question

00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,240
i was going through the references were

00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:46,079
provided at the right bottom

00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:48,160
corner yeah uh found somewhere that

00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:50,079
your company helps in organizing the

00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:54,079
sports events

00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:54,079
uh how is these things possible

00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:00,400
um okay can you can you add some caller

00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,440
to your to your question like how would

00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:05,040
the

00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:07,520
how would the problem set up look like

00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,079
okay uh not sure means there was a

00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,440
reference

00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:14,960
pdf file to study use case

00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:17,359
scheduling of sporting events yeah

00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:19,040
kpmg has uh strong credentials in

00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:22,240
scheduling of sporting events

00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:24,160
in switzerland and internationally yes

00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,720
yeah we have been doing uh sports

00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:30,720
schedules for for quite a while

00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:33,760
um my my question was was about uh

00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,599
um what uh

00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,280
we we have a few minions happy to stay

00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,079
also longer in the channel if this is

00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,000
possible

00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:42,160
but uh what would you like would you

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,520
like me to give you like an idea of how

00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,079
we structure a model

00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:48,079
or are you interested in some specific

00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,760
no means this is the first time i

00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:53,200
heard that machine learning can be used

00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:56,560
for uh scheduling the events

00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:59,839
just an overview i'm not a programmer

00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:04,079
i'm from uh electronics perspective

00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:09,119
well okay i understand the question um

00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:12,640
so um

00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:14,240
generally um most of the schedules that

00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:17,280
we have tackled

00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:19,520
uh the scheduling problem was

00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:20,960
an operational research problem so what

00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:24,240
we're talking about the

00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:27,599
mixed integer linear program

00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:29,839
um we are also uh

00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:31,599
by the way we also presented at the

00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:35,280
scientific conference about

00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:37,280
how we do uh schedule optimization

00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,079
with the mixed integer linear program

00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,240
and five or six months ago

00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,359
so perhaps if you like after after this

00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,880
session i can

00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:50,160
i can send you the material

00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:54,319
yeah please that is interesting

00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:55,760
and where does machine learning come

00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:59,760
into play

00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:02,240
um i think there in the sports industry

00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:04,960
we have a very similar setup

00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,760
where we use the generative models to

00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:11,040
estimate

00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:11,040
the probability distributions of a key

00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,640
optimization parameters

00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:22,640
and for example one of the classic

00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:25,040
use cases that we had with the sports uh

00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,960
organization is uh they would like to

00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:31,200
understand demand better

00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:33,760
where demand is a number of viewers

00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,040
for an event when the competition is

00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,319
streamed

00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:41,760
and the number of attendants

00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:46,000
that will be able to join physically

00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:49,200
so what we do is we take historical data

00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:53,200
about the competition about

00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:56,000
the event um sales data for example

00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,280
streaming data with the partners such as

00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,920
for example

00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,190
i don't know the youtube's equivalent

00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,289
and

00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:03,289
[Music]

00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,200
what what we do there is we build the

00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,480
model that says

00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:12,480
hey this is what we expect demand to be

00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,760
and then based on that and based on

00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:15,920
other constraints such as the

00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,880
availability of the location

00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,599
the cost of renting a location because

00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,960
often

00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:25,839
that also is is varying we have

00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,880
the mixed integer program mixed integer

00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:31,359
linear program

00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:33,440
that then produces the answer

00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:35,200
that totally makes sense very happy

00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,520
means so this is the first time

00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:40,079
where i heard how to use machine

00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:42,640
learning before organizing something

00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:44,880
ah yeah it's a it's it's a very yeah i

00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:45,920
know i understand it's uh it's something

00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,160
relatively new

00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:50,319
uh the classical approach is a

00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,359
deterministic mixed integer linear

00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:53,599
program

00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:54,960
um one and one other element which is

00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:58,400
interesting

00:46:54,960 --> 00:47:01,599
uh is that well most of the time

00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:05,200
you end up having

00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:07,280
a not just one solution

00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,720
but you end up having several solutions

00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,839
several optimal solutions

00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,839
on the frontier

00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:16,960
and this is because when when it comes

00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,119
to scheduling one of the biggest

00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,599
challenges is that you generally is a

00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:25,599
multi-objective optimization

00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:28,640
uh you have kpis like for example

00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:31,359
travel but

00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:33,440
you also have kpis related to the

00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:35,760
fairness

00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,520
and getting into fairness is a very

00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,920
tricky problem

00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:41,200
fairness can be quantified in different

00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,720
ways

00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,960
one way is for example if you have an

00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,200
event where the competition sees

00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,960
home and away games what you want to

00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:51,839
have is a schedule where

00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:53,920
as much as possible ever a partner on my

00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:58,079
way home away on my way

00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,800
but the now with the sports federations

00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:01,680
are looking at

00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:03,119
also other factors such as for example

00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:06,559
the estimation of the

00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:10,079
impact of travel on the

00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:11,839
uh players on the athletes

00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:13,520
and this is again a machine learning

00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:16,319
topic where you start

00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:17,760
from certain information about the

00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:20,960
traveling and you try

00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:24,160
also to sports team now are

00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:25,359
really getting into the quantified self

00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,800
perspective

00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:31,200
so they are using devices to track uh

00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,319
uh physic physiological data about the

00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:35,280
players

00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:37,680
and based on that and information about

00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:40,000
the traveling schedules

00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:41,359
federation is asking for example what is

00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:44,880
the impact

00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:47,839
of uh for example

00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,839
uh jet lag

00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,280
so this is where where we stand with

00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:59,359
respect to

00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:02,559
sport vacations if um if you ping me

plus i definitely would like to learn

00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:23,599
about the mathematics

00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:27,200
means most often we use machine learning

00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,119
with

00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:31,359
algorithms which are pre-written

00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:34,079
completely defined and all

00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:36,960
how mathematics will be helpful uh i'll

00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,960
get to learn from you
