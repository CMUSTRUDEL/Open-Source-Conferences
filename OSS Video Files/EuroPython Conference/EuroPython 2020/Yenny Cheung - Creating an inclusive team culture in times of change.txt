hi there so

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,480
our next speaker chen chung thank you

00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,360
very much

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,560
yeah nice to see you all here even

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,240
though we're gathered around

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,840
i guess in the virtual environment but

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,760
it's still really nice to be with the

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,080
community here

00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,080
so hi my name is yenny cheng and today

00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,640
i'll be sharing with you my perspective

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,960
on creating an inclusive team culture in

00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,120
times of change which i think is pretty

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,920
relevant to what we have here and i will

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,200
focus on

00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,840
navigating the changes that covet 19 has

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,840
brought to us

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,039
before we get into that you might be

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,399
asking hey yanny why are you online here

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,640
presenting this session

00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:53,039
and how is that relevant to what i do

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,239
brief introduction i'm an engineering

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,480
manager at yep

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,879
i lead the women in tech employee

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,480
resource group at yelp here in germany

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,960
and i spend quite some time in the

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,559
diversity and inclusion space

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,720
i've given a couple allied skill

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,159
trainings and talks on unconscious bias

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,880
on workplace culture

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,920
and of course python and that's why i'm

00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,759
here with the euro python community

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,240
inclusion is a really important topic

00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,560
when we talk about workplace cultures

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,960
this concept is like especially

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,960
important during the times of change

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,200
so today i'll be sharing with you my

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,080
perspectives on creating an inclusive

00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,040
team culture

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,520
especially during the turbulent times so

00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,280
that we can navigate that together

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,960
the main audience for the talk is

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,960
leaders of a company

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,560
leaders however though to me is not

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,479
defined by title

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,880
that means it will be relevant to you if

00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,880
you're an individual contributor

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,200
folks and management technical

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,680
leadership as long as you have the will

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,680
to lead

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,880
if there is anything i would like you to

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,439
retain after the talk

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,680
it is people first we would want to

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:02,240
treat our colleagues as human beings

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,119
before

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,240
employees so how we communicate and

00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:09,360
manage the changes

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,319
during covet 19 really matters our

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,400
employees

00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:13,440
our teammates and our colleagues will

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,920
never forget

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,760
how they were treated during this time

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,160
so all the content for the rest of the

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:24,720
talk we focus on how we can achieve this

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,720
people first mindset and also inclusion

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,360
so to give you a better idea we can

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,599
start with leadership styles described

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,280
on lara hogan's blog i'm a big fan

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:37,840
and i'll give you a minute to read

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,840
through all of these leadership styles

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,040
during the kofi 19 crisis we want to

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,360
focus on the green and blue

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,959
so what it means is having maybe high

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,440
emotional intelligence

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,440
and also we will want to appear calm

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,239
cool and collected because during times

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,599
of change

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,000
people are afraid and they want

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:09,200
direction

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,840
great so here is our agenda for today

00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,920
we'll talk about safety and self-care

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,640
we'll revisit our expectations with the

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,560
team

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,480
and during this time communicating

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,959
effectively is important

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,840
we want to conduct inclusive meetings

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:27,200
and last but not least check our biases

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,360
so let's get started

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,319
safety and self-care that's really the

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,440
most important one so we put it first

00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,799
i'll tell you a little anecdote early

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,040
march i had a meeting with

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,799
other engineering managers in the office

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,879
and were talking about the possibility

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,799
of working from home

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,640
some companies in the industry had

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,319
already started doing that

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,920
but it was well before there were

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,280
guidelines from the government that we

00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,200
need to do that

00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,799
some engineers in the office they

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,879
request to work from home and we're

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,519
discussing as a group whether we should

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,640
start having engineers do that there

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,519
were some concerns

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,040
raised on engineers performance and also

00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,959
like worrying that they might not

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,640
perform given that they already given

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,319
they're already given feedback about

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,400
communication

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,000
but multiple managers disagreed and we

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,639
came to the consensus that

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,320
safety trumps all the other concerns and

00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,120
today i think

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,360
i stand by this principle as well and we

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,680
agree that safety just trumps all the

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,240
other

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:30,479
considerations so after we address the

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,479
physical safety let's talk about our

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,639
emotional safety and well-being during

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,120
this time as well

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,040
we're coping with a global pandemic and

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,440
we're advised to stay home

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,880
depending on which region you're in but

00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,919
staying home is

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,600
a wise choice usually schools could be

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,840
closed and

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,759
if you're a caregiver for parents

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,960
attention could be split between child

00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,960
care and work

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,080
and with the economic downturn we might

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,040
even have to worry about

00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,400
financial stability and something basic

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,080
like toilet paper could run out anytime

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,840
all of these factors come into play

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,240
while we're supposed to stay socially

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,000
distant from our friends and family when

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,880
like right now it really is the time

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,400
that we need them the most

00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,840
so it's not it's really an

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,160
understatement to say that we're under

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,440
stress

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,360
there are several things that we can

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,880
help the team do

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,800
so 22 of the people rated unplugging

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,759
after work as the biggest struggle

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,840
when we're working from home as leaders

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,919
we can promote people to take breaks

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,160
to log off after work and really check

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,759
out and also provide mental health

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,639
resources

00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,400
and the best way to do this is to lead

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,639
by example

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,400
model the behavior you want to encourage

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,720
your team as a leader

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,560
the best advice i've gotten from my

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,560
direct reports from my team

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,000
is to take care of myself first and then

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,000
other people would follow

00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,400
and i think this was a great advice that

00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,400
i got

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,280
ever since the work from home day

00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,919
started or you know during the pandemic

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,919
times

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:07,840
we had different initiatives for example

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,840
having virtual water coolers

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,199
it means we're keeping a video chat

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,360
channel on to

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,440
kind of mimic the kitchen conversations

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,000
that we normally have in an office

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,160
we would also try out virtual team

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,919
lunches virtual daily breaks to keep

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,560
everyone connected

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:26,319
but keeping them optional is a good idea

00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,479
so that people don't get overwhelmed

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,840
over more compulsory meetings to do when

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,639
there are other things they might need

00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,560
to attend in their lives

00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,880
so we have established that we want to

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,639
care for ourselves and the team

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,000
then i guess this question really popped

00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,080
in my mind is

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,080
what does the team really need right now

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,639
i came across this interesting read on

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,720
gitlab's definition of remote adaptation

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,479
since right now a lot of us are being

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,960
forced into remote work

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,880
so i think it might be worth it to look

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,560
at companies who have always done it

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,000
that way already and that can give us a

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,880
bit more ideas on

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,680
what to do there the first phase they

00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,639
highlighted

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,039
is skeuomorph so we're going to go

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,240
through

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,639
that to see what that means we tend to

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,479
imitate the design structures and norms

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,680
of an office environment

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:22,080
so some examples we can think of here is

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,759
replacing hallway conversations with

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,520
private slack messages

00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,919
so that it's like you directly talk to

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,199
people and keeping the meetings with the

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:33,759
same people with the same etiquette

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,440
or we ask ourselves this question i

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,360
think a lot of teams do right what tools

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,800
can i use to replace the whiteboarding

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,800
experience we need to design

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,160
stuff we need to draw diagrams like what

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,240
are some of the software that can

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,280
replace that experience

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,199
but staying in this mode prevents us to

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,240
utilize the whole benefits that the

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,319
remote situation can bring

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,840
and we move to the second phase of

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,000
remote adaptation which is called

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,039
functional

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:04,080
so here are some of these examples here

00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,759
we start asking the questions what if we

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,440
don't do things the way we've

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,840
always done them some examples include

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,680
we want to record meetings it helps

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,599
filling the gaps created by these

00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,080
undocumented discussions that

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,680
could happen in private chats right so

00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,639
we also want to replace

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,560
private chats with the public messages

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:27,039
so that more input can be gathered in

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,919
the public channel and we can also use

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,919
the team more

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,919
and the third phase of remote adaptation

00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,919
is asynchronous

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,000
so it depends on how well a company does

00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:45,120
in completing work without

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,760
being synchronous so we focus on the

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,000
asynchronous part of things and we want

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,120
to save that precious online time that

00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,519
we use

00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,160
with informal and social events so

00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,000
information

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,279
sharing is more centralized at this

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,240
stage we rely

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:03,279
on issue trackers like jira that we use

00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,519
or at gitlab they use gitlab

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,080
and documentations are done first and

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,519
then it becomes a source of truth so in

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,680
this case we can prevent

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,279
information from being segmented across

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,360
different channels

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,600
and in the following sections we'll look

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,120
into solutions mostly in the phase

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,839
two and phase three of the remote

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,839
adaptation phase

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,760
so while it's helpful to look at

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,000
frameworks i think

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,680
for developers or engineers we like

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,360
structure and frameworks

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,959
to see what kind of things the team

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,480
would need the best

00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,160
channel as leaders is still to

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,600
understand the team's concerns and

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,000
gather their feedback

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,600
through conversations like for me i do

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,360
regular one-on-ones with the team

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,839
so that's a good way for me to gather

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,160
feedback try not to assume

00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,519
uh what is going on in their lives and

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,839
also the impact

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,880
i think actively listen to really

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,279
understand

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,600
and sometimes like being a good listener

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,279
to absorb the negativity out

00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,600
and helping your teammates find a new

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:07,600
path forward that's the most valuable

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,600
thing a leader can offer at this time

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,160
now let's move on to the second section

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,839
which is to revisit

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:18,240
our expectations so i am

00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,320
reiterating here this is not a normal

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,920
work from home situation and sometimes

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,920
like people might be back to the office

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,000
but this is not normal

00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,160
firstly our colleagues need to attend to

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,200
their lives and second of all their

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,959
employees

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,399
and hence the same kind of guidelines

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,839
shouldn't apply

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,760
there will be people who didn't have

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,560
good enough connections during this time

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,640
there will be

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,399
disruptions and most people don't really

00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,959
have a good enough setup to

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,959
work at home

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,959
and hence we want to set clear

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,880
expectations

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,480
but there might be a need to be more

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,480
flexible

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,959
be reminded that while our mindset

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,800
changes that we need to be more flexible

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:59,440
and we adjust our expectations we should

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,600
revisit that along with the team

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,440
so ask our team members what they need

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,920
right now and what we can do best

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,120
to support them and help them meet

00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,000
expectations

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,959
and try to be as specific as we can here

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,839
are some

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,959
examples here apart from revisiting the

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,399
expectations

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:19,760
like here are a list of things that we

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,560
can offer for example flexible hours

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,279
uh list out uh some tasks that they're

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,959
on

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,399
and we think about what to drop or

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,560
delegate so that we can adjust the

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,320
workload accordingly

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,560
another thing to pay attention to is

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,720
maybe not scheduling team events in the

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,240
evening because

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,480
teammates might need to attend to other

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,480
engagements and like that they need to

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,519
feedback that's a big part of a leader's

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,600
job to give feedback

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,800
but on giving feedback again people

00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,560
first

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,480
especially when we notice areas that

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,200
people can improve on

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,000
try to assume good intention especially

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,560
when giving that

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,720
feedback be genuinely curious about the

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,440
co-worker and understand

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,279
that their behaviors might be uh coming

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,880
from a different place before we make a

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,519
judgment call there

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,000
one example could be a team member

00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,480
constantly looks disengaged in meetings

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,240
and

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,680
we might assume that they're not serious

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,839
about their work

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,320
but the back story could be that their

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,680
partner also had work engagement at that

00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,920
time and it's their turn

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,440
to look after the kids so in this case

00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,120
we don't want to

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,480
straight out go with harsh feedback we

00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,480
want to understand the story

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,040
we also talked about the stress that we

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,200
need to manage during this time

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,600
and how folks are performing now might

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,760
not be the best indication at all

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,040
uh on how they're performing when things

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,800
are normal

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,320
it's also likely that we succumb to

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,000
recency bias

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,480
which means that we'll judge people

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
mainly because mainly based on what they

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,160
recently do

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
compared to really looking at the whole

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,560
track record there

00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,680
later on we'll dive deeper into the bias

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,000
section but

00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:07,440
my take here is this is not the time for

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,279
formal performance management

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,040
we covered corrective feedback but there

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,639
is also the other side of things which

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,040
is positive reinforcement

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,639
praise right when a team does great work

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,040
we still want to celebrate

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,720
and it's actually a great way to for us

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,680
to build a positive team culture

00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:25,680
especially during now

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,720
these days i found myself using yelp

00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,959
love more

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,760
so this is something that we use at yelp

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,839
to show appreciation to your colleagues

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,959
it could be that they did great in a

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,480
project launch

00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,399
it could be that i don't know they post

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,560
the puppy pictures on the

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,079
on the team channel and brought joy to

00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,399
our lives

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,760
different things and it even has a slack

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,560
integration so it

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,000
looks like this but this is a tool right

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,000
it doesn't have to be this tool

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,600
it's the spirit that i want to emphasize

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,120
on the positive reinforcement and

00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,120
building positivity in the team

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,959
next up we have effective communication

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,399
it's an interesting one it is difficult

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,079
because right now the team craves

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,680
direction and information

00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,360
and sometimes we don't have them right

00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,079
transparency is key

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,680
but if we don't provide information the

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,600
team will just make up stories and

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,959
explanations or

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,639
do that behind our backs right and

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,959
rumors will spread this is

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:26,240
understandable it's human nature and

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:30,240
um but there are tricks and tips to

00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,880
navigate through that to mitigate that

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,079
we might fall into some traps uh where

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,320
as leaders we over

00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,560
promise if we tell them well there'll be

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,800
no changes to our product roadmap or

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,839
our company could gain back its found in

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:44,160
three months

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,120
well that might not be true right we

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,279
cannot predict the future we won't know

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,160
and the other trap as is we under

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:51,360
communicate

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,040
just because we don't want to say

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,240
anything wrong we just don't say

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,160
anything

00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,440
we avoid communicating to the team so

00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,880
that we don't take back on our words

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,279
but that's not ideal either right people

00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,160
make up stories so here's how we can

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,440
navigate that

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,639
communications for the information that

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,279
we already know we can

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,040
over communicate like spam the team a

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,320
good practice in general but usually

00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,720
during the work from home

00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,760
times let's make sure or you know half

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,160
work from home half

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,160
um office times let's make sure we work

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,839
on better messaging and repeat them

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,760
through different channels like

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,120
sometimes i do that through one-on-ones

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,199
and then through meetings

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,839
through emails and slack through blog

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:34,160
posts and this message we want to craft

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,440
we want to acknowledge the distress

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:39,519
and the difficulties that we are facing

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,839
but at the same time without giving in

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,560
to helplessness

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,480
in these few weeks i'm spending much

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,399
more time preparing presentations blog

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,160
posts and communications to the team so

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:54,000
that i can be as transparent as i can

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,839
now one tip i got from lara hogan laura

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,240
who gonna get because i'm her number one

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,639
fan

00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,839
uh if we don't have the information yet

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,839
but if we can find out

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,000
commit to a time and channel that we can

00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:07,600
give that information so that they don't

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,680
um your team doesn't um

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,680
so that your team feels better taken

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,279
care of and it helps set the right

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,800
expectation for them so that they're

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,959
less anxious

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,320
we cannot predict the future for sure

00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:20,399
but we could still

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,480
keep absorbing the news in the company

00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:23,759
and then we can offer our more informed

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,000
interpretations

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,800
that way we can curb the rumors before

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,800
they spread too far

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,240
at the same time before be careful to

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,920
what we commit to

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,920
for the team there are a lot of things

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,680
we don't know even though we're leaders

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,519
and if we don't have the information

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,800
there are times when we need to say i

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,440
don't know

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,000
so we want to put on that leadership hat

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,000
on

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,519
high emotional intelligence calm and

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,279
collected

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,519
we'll be assessing information as they

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:55,279
come by try not to overcommit

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,279
and also resist the panic mode

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,279
now let's move on to conducting

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,440
inclusive meetings

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,400
but before we even talk about how to

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,400
conduct

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,600
inclusive meetings one thing to ask

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,679
ourselves is

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,199
is that something we need to discuss in

00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,199
person think about like

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,280
functional the phase two of the remote

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,959
adaptation that we looked at

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,319
if we can replace that meeting with

00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,039
other asynchronous

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:21,760
channels it might be more beneficial

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,319
because we have

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,360
other distractions in place and even if

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,600
we don't

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,600
at least from personal experience a long

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,520
day of video calls it seems like an

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,480
intense netflix binge walking

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,919
watching session for me and i don't

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,400
really want that i don't know if

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,360
you're into that but as we were speaking

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,720
like our team

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,480
we're looking into different

00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,480
alternatives of uh

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,559
for video conferencing because of the

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,240
tiring screen time

00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:50,000
one thing i've tried is doing walking

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,280
one-on-ones it could be like

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,960
uh so we do work from home uh still now

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,480
so i could be walking in my living room

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,000
and my report could be walking in their

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,480
living room or they could be taking a

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,160
walk in a park another

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,840
idea is usually we have this

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,080
brainstorming meeting where it's

00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,640
quite long right and everybody gather

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,679
but what we try is to divide the teams

00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,760
into groups

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,760
and we convene after a week or so so

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,240
they have time to work asynchronously on

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,919
it

00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,240
and then we come back to present to each

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,000
other and discuss the results

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,160
and also let me know what you've tried

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
so far i'd love to learn from your

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,400
experience we're all trying to figure it

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,400
out here

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,559
now when we participate in meetings here

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,400
are a few things we can do to make the

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,000
meeting more inclusive

00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,720
we need to get away from phase one

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,640
skewer morph of remote adaptation

00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:42,080
where we're just copying the meeting

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,919
exactly as how we did it before

00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,760
so what we can do is like for folks who

00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,400
are normally taking up more air time in

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,240
the meeting

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,480
try to step back and make sure other

00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:53,520
people have time to chime in

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,080
in video calls it's common to talk over

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,240
each other

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,600
and we stumble upon the oh sorry you go

00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,520
ahead like thing

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,520
and we might want to leave a longer

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,280
pause after we speak

00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,679
to ensure that people who want to

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,039
participate can get the chance to

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,880
there are also other features like

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,400
raising hands for example on zoom

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,000
you can do that too depending on the

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,919
video chat platform

00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
and we can pay attention to those and

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,760
make use of that

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,919
everyone is behind the screen now so

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,120
some context could be lost with our body

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,080
language

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,360
one tip i got is to emote more okay now

00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,880
i'm very self-conscious

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,559
to convey our tone to be more engaging

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,080
and to avoid misunderstandings

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:35,520
especially when we give feedback right

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:37,919
or have crucial conversations

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,880
now on top of previous suggestions as a

00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,880
facilitator

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,000
uh we can send out an agenda before the

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,320
meeting starts

00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,840
that way folks can be better prepared in

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,520
video chats it's more often to have

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,120
these long monologues and you don't

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,960
really see people's reaction

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,200
versus active discussion like right now

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,720
right a long monologue

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,000
for people who are more extroverted or

00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,880
more used to talking and they're

00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,039
thinking

00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,320
it might be pretty normal it doesn't

00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,280
affect their working style

00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,480
uh too much but for people who are more

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,200
introverted and that

00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,320
they prefer to have ideas fleshed out

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,240
before they speak

00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,240
preparing an agenda and distributing

00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,000
them beforehand really helps

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:16,000
and we could also get some discussion

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,760
out of that document already

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,760
so that when the meeting actually takes

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,760
place it will be short and sweet

00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,039
so that we can get out of there there

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,520
faster

00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,200
live captions also seem to work with

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,600
apps like google me

00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,799
especially for people where the

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,840
connection might not be

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,840
optimal as we've talked about there are

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,919
other distractions when meeting

00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,280
is happening like it now it became a

00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,400
pretty often thing where your family

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,440
member can just

00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:46,480
uh photobomb your

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,799
uh your video call one

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,880
suggestion i have to you is to make

00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,360
participation optional

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,120
we can open up more channel where folks

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,720
can communicate like for example an

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,320
agenda asynchronously

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,240
and we need to acknowledge that not

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,200
everybody has the same capacity to

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,320
participate

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,760
right here right now recording readings

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,440
is also a good practice as we talked

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,799
about so that people can revisit the

00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,799
content later

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,919
and sending recaps and meeting notes

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,640
after to make sure

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,559
everybody's on the same page is good in

00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,760
the end it all comes back to

00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,760
over communication

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,919
now this is more important than ever for

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,840
us to check our biases they're always

00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:29,919
here but there are several traps that

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,280
we can talk about here like we want to

00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,840
help and be more

00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:36,480
inclusive but sometimes we fall into

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,480
more traps

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:41,520
so here's one we could be subject to

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,520
availability bias

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,919
for example during the work from home

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:48,400
time a team member had to go out

00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,200
on short notice because who knows they

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,039
might have

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,039
found out that their supermarket has

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:55,039
toilet paper again

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,559
or another team member is taking longer

00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,720
lunches because now they have to cook

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:01,039
for the family

00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,880
and we might then just see them as less

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:07,120
reliable members of the team

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,120
even though they have been great before

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,120
there is no stereotyping that could be

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,039
dangerous

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,480
for example if someone on a team they

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,320
have dependents

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,760
and their kids you know they're not at

00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,200
school right now and you know they have

00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,600
to take care of them

00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,200
we might fall into the trap of assuming

00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,480
that we want help right assuming that

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,960
they don't want to take on

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,240
extra responsibilities and we didn't ask

00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:32,320
them

00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,080
so the key is to fight against jumping

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,480
to conclusion too soon

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,440
try not to assume what's going on or the

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,440
impact that is

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,919
having on on people try to actively

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,000
listen

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,360
and really understand the team's needs

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,559
before coming to

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,559
rushed conclusions

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,720
so we're wrapping up here coming back to

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,120
this slide

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,919
we want to be able to put people first

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,320
we want to

00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,440
lead with empathy and calmness during

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,520
this time

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,159
and that would bring about an inclusive

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,159
team culture

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,559
and i want to close by this an inclusive

00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,640
team culture helps us through

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:13,679
crisis and it will continue to help us

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:16,240
through peace

00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:18,240
this is not something that is extra i

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,880
believe this is a core skill for

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,840
all leaders now and it will continue to

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,840
be in the future

00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,000
what i have discussed with you here uh

00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,640
today represents a collective

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
uh and diverse thoughts that i gathered

00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,679
from different places

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,600
so like i want to thank these

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,600
individuals and conferences for giving

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,960
me the ideas

00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:43,440
and these are the image credits

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,200
some resources i used to prepare and

00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,520
thank you all for attending

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,679
now i'll open up for questions if you

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,840
didn't manage to catch me we can talk

00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,520
on this court or afterwards you can also

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,919
tweet me at yanisha

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,919
thank you

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,360
thank you very much

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,159
thanks for inviting me i see there are

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,360
no questions

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,600
yet on the q and a please go and

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:15,840
zoom there is a q a button where you can

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,640
ask questions

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:20,640
um there is also the channel on this

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,679
chord if you want to join that channel

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,279
just press

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:28,720
ctrl k or on a mac os command

00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:30,960
k and then you see a pop-up window and

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,720
then you enter inclusive

00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,000
and then you will find this channel

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,440
there you can also

00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,279
see there is upload in the channel

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,000
already but

00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:41,360
if if you want to ask questions here

00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,640
live you can do that

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,080
using zoom i see there are no questions

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,159
yet so let me start

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:52,480
with the first question um one thing i

00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,279
i attended actually many many many

00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,919
meetings

00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,799
um online meetings the past couple of

00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,840
months

00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:01,840
and one thing i realized i got really

00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:04,559
tired you mentioned that too

00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,840
um something i in live meetings i never

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,880
have this

00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,320
and maybe you can explain this why why

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,640
this happens why i haven't

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,679
beco i'm programmer i can be 10 hours on

00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,360
the screen is no problem

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,799
yeah actually i'm curious about that so

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,360
i looked it up so

00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,640
uh i can't quote the exact research but

00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:24,400
they say that like

00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,400
when you talk to people in person there

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,120
isn't a lack but then when you talk to

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,279
people

00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,240
in terms of video chats then there's a

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,000
slight lag

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,919
and apparently it's really tiring for

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,200
your brain to process that

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,600
like it doesn't know what to do with

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,039
this information when the person you're

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,400
talking to is slightly

00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,039
slower than that the speech so there is

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,520
that

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,880
uh but i guess like uh for myself right

00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:49,279
when i code it's also

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,640
usually dark mode but then for video

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,720
call it's very bright

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,480
uh so that might also contribute to that

00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,200
so one thing we have tried is we do

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,080
voice calls uh sometimes now like not

00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,679
just stick to

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,279
video calls like in the beginning we say

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,760
that it might be more personal right

00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,720
to do video chats but like uh sometimes

00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,799
we also switch to

00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,520
voice so that we can take a break from

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:11,840
staring at the screen

00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,279
okay thanks i see there are some

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:16,880
questions popping up now

00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:18,640
first question from matthias chris k

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,919
do you have a daily status video

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:24,480
meetings what do you call them

00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:27,200
we still call them stand up although

00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,200
everyone sits

00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:31,919
yeah we still have that we still call it

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,120
stand up uh actually i never thought

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,279
about that

00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,400
i don't think that changed drastically

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,880
actually

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,960
um i think if anything like we brought

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,360
more fun to it like for a while we use

00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,080
the

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:46,080
snap camera so you can add like

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,000
different backgrounds or

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,840
outfits or you can turn into a potato

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,679
and stuff so we started having fun with

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:55,200
that but we still call it stand up

00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,200
i don't think that changed too much

00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,840
okay thanks then we have one question

00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,080
from diego russo

00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,880
you said there is no there is no normal

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,000
time for

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,720
manager performance what if this will be

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,039
the new normal long enough in order to

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,600
be

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,559
to be force us to treat it as a new

00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,360
normal

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,720
what's your suggest suggestion here

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,880
that's a tough question

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,640
um yeah i've been thinking about that as

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,679
well i think

00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:27,279
the way i would approach it

00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:30,640
is while we can have the formal

00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:32,559
performance management plan but i think

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,880
the way i would structure it would be

00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:36,399
more empathetic during this time so

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,440
instead of like okay you need to do this

00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:39,120
better you need to

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,120
like this is not meeting expectation

00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,760
let's do one thing at a time let's focus

00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,360
on

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,799
just one thing do it well then we move

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,559
on to another

00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:50,559
so i'm more more empathetic

00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,240
version of this but i agree with you

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,159
like at one point we need to

00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,159
get back to normal or whatever normal

00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,080
would mean in the future

00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,240
so we gotta we gotta do something about

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,240
it

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,720
okay there's one more question

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,200
unfortunately we

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,120
running out of time so please take all

00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,760
the questions to the channel

00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,799
go to this chord press ctrl k or command

00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,880
k on the mac

00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:19,919
and um type inclusive and you see

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,880
first channel will be the chat channel

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:24,559
of this

00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:31,840
