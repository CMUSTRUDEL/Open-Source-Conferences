By Ruud van der Ham

In the Python landscape, there are several high-end GUI packages. Of course, thereâ€™s tkinter which is part of the standard library. And there is wxPython and several versions of Qt. What they share is that they are very flexible but not only have a steep learning curve but also take considerable development effort to realize even a simple user interface.
At the other of the spectrum, there are several design tools that either generate code of a layout structure. In many cases, the functionality is rather limited, though.
Relatively recent, an independent open-source developer (not me) has made a product that tries to bridge the gap between these two worlds: PySimpleGUI. This package runs on top of tkinter, QT for Windows, wxPython and Remi.
In this talk, I want to show the design methodology behind this fascinating product that might change the way people look at GUIs.
I will start with live coding a simple yet not evident program that shows the basic concepts. With this, I will demonstrate the design philosophy.
PySimpleGUI can also be used to implement a user-friendly interface as opposed to command-line interfaces.
From there, I will give an overview of some more elements present in this package.
Finally, I will show a full-featured GUI program with several bells and whistles.
