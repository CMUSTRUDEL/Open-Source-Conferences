By Mikhail Medvedev

Rust is a rising star of the programming language world. I'd like to discuss it from a Python developer perspective. Obviously, Rust is not a replacement for Python, but in case you're seeking better performance it may be a good idea to build an extension. This is safer and arguably easier to do in Rust than in C.
In this talk we will take a look at existing crates that provide interface to Python and see how easy it is to use them.
Then we go through the demo and see it in action.
Run some benchmarks against pure Python and also Cython.
Write a Dockerfile to build it all together.
Discuss CI/CD for mixed Rust/Python projects.
