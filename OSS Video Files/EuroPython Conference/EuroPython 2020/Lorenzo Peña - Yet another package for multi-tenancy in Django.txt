By Lorenzo Peña

Django is a popular, solid web framework for perfectionists with deadlines, with a wide ecosystem of packages that extend its powers in multiple directions. In the era of peaking popularity of Node/Deno, microservices, and heavyweight browser rendered webapps, Django still remains a triumphant monolith maker, very capable of major undertakings in the web arena.

For all you Django-lovers out there, it seems to me like a matter of time before you have to do some form of multi-tenancy in Django. Taking a solution that works well for one tenant and extending it to multiple tenants should still be a problem for perfectionists with deadlines. Interestingly, when it comes to covering all the many facets of multi-tenancy, Django can be not so batteries included, as one might end up working around or 'hacking' the framework in order to get things done.

In this talk I will walk you through the challenges of bringing multi-tenancy to a Django project. We'll cover the fundamental plumbing required to make it work reliably, securely, and elegantly. You will be expected to have a basic knowledge of Django (models, settings, users, URL reversing), and you will learn the working logic behind popular multi-tenancy packages like a href=""https://github.com/bernardopires/django-tenant-schemas""django-tenant-schemas/a and a href=""https://github.com/tomturner/django-tenants""django-tenants/a.
