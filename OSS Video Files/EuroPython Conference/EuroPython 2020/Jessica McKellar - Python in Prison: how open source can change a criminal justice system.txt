hello everyone welcome to the last

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,360
keynote

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,360
event of the day

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,039
so the united states has the highest

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,880
incarceration rate in the world

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:27,439
with over 2.2 million people behind bars

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,439
in our prisons jails juvenile facilities

00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,559
and detention centers

00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,960
what do we do as software engineers to

00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,079
elaborate we are joined by the amazing

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,200
jessica mckellen

00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,440
so over to you thank you so much

00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,600
let me make sure i can get my screen

00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,719
sharing

00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,120
set up reasonably one second here and

00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,320
then

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,320
if i go ahead and

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,039
which uh can i get some affirmation on

00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:00,320
what's what if any slides you see

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,000
yeah we see your slice great okay uh so

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,960
uh welcome everyone my name is jessica

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,640
mckellar and we're

00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,720
here today to talk about python in

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,520
prisons how open source can change a

00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:13,200
criminal justice system

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:16,080
uh so the united states locks up

00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,799
uh more people per capita than any other

00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,360
country

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,439
uh i live in san francisco in the state

00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:26,000
of california in the united states

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:27,280
and this is the country that i live in

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,200
i live in a country that still has the

00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,960
death penalty and

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,280
routinely executes people at the federal

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,520
level and in many states

00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,040
i also live in a country where children

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,640
serve life sentences without the

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,479
possibility of parole in other words

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,600
children are condemned to die

00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,840
in prison my

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,520
state california has the largest death

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,119
row in the western hemisphere

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,759
at san quentin state prison which is

00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,880
just 45 minutes away from where i live

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,240
in san francisco

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,159
i live in a country where the criminal

00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,240
justice system is a direct successor to

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,439
the control and labor economics of

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,719
slavery

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,840
in some counties prisons are the single

00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,679
largest employer

00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,360
prisoners literally build and run the

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,120
prisons that can find them

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,640
building construction and maintenance

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,080
meal preparation

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,200
laundry janitorial services every

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,120
california license plate is made by an

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,720
incarcerated worker at folsom state

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,280
prison

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,480
incarcerated workers are paid 8 cents to

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,440
37 cents

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,120
per hour for their work by comparison

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,400
california's minimum wage is currently

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,879
12 dollars per hour one

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,800
third of california's firefighters are

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,800
incarcerated firefighters

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,879
california actually doesn't have enough

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,519
firefighters to fight its fires right

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,239
now

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,519
because the prisons are on lockdown due

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,200
to covet 19

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,640
and so those incarcerated firefighters

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,319
are not available

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,599
um and they've become part of us the

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,599
system we rely on them

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,360
the system is extremely racist uh and

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,599
it's also

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,560
uh ineffective our prisons don't prevent

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,239
crime they actually

00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,720
increase it because incarceration

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,280
produces a lifelong record and stigma

00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,280
that makes

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,480
successful re-entry with stable housing

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,159
and employment extremely difficult

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,239
the system is ineffective and it's not

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,480
even what survivors of crime want

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,440
this system persists not because it is a

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,200
good one

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,120
but because it is an effective system of

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,840
racial control and because it generates

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,840
a lot of money

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,599
i talk about prison a lot because some

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,879
of the most important people in my life

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,480
are or used to be

00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,959
in prison friends

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,319
co-workers i spend time every day with

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,159
people who used to be in prison people

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,120
who are serving life sentences for

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,879
serious

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,480
violent crimes but who despite the

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,720
brutal circumstances

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,959
of a prison system that is not sincerely

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,640
interested in their rehabilitation

00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,560
did the work to understand their own

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,599
trauma and the harm they caused and

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,599
became different people

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,319
i talk about prison because this brutal

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,879
ineffective unjust system

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,799
must be dismantled am i talking about

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,879
prison in forums like this one because

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,599
it's a system that people like us

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,080
tech people open source people are

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,280
actually

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,400
disproportionately able to change

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,479
and that's what i'm here to talk about

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,160
today so as a quick reminder on who i am

00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,520
my name is jessica mckellar

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,440
i'm sort of a lifelong

00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,560
python user and participant in the

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,160
python community

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,759
i helped build the boston python user

00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,800
group into the largest python user group

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,320
in the world

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,400
i was a director for the python software

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,080
foundation i've been the diversity chair

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,680
for pycon north america for half a

00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,600
decade

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,759
my particular passions within the python

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,800
community are expanding access to

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,680
programming

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,800
and teaching new programmers i also

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,160
spend a lot of time in prison and

00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,800
supporting re-entry for people getting

00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,720
out of prison

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,840
i actually teach a python programming

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,759
class in

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,280
san quentin state prison in california

00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,360
uh every company that i've ever worked

00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,800
for uh has out of python tech stack i'm

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,160
currently a founder and the cto of a

00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,720
tech company in san francisco called

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,960
pilot

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,720
that of course uses python and a bunch

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,840
of pilots employees

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,840
are formally incarcerated

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,080
one of the engineers at my company is

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,639
named simon

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,440
simon was incarcerated as a child and

00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,840
grew up

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,039
in the california prison system he

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,960
learned how to speak english

00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,600
in prison simon also learned how to

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,759
program

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,639
in prison through a non-profit called

00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,400
the last mile which is how i met him

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,160
the last mile was created to teach

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,400
incarcerated people technology skills

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,160
that align with modern labor markets

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,199
so that when graduates get out of prison

00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,960
they can successfully get a job

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,120
prior to the last mile most of the work

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,039
experience available in prisons was

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,720
manual labor you could learn how to cook

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,560
in the prison kitchen you could get

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,400
certified as a janitor

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,160
while working on the prison custodial

00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,440
staff uh perhaps you could learn

00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,919
something like carpentry through the

00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,000
prison

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,520
industry authority and these are all

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,840
important jobs and skills but in

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,520
practice it can be difficult to secure a

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,560
job in these areas of the labor market

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,639
when you get out of prison

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,160
so the last mile took a new approach and

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,759
decided to focus on

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,600
one of the fastest growing labor markets

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,039
in the united states and to teach people

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,560
how to program

00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,479
the last miles coding program was

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,479
started in 2014

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,919
and is the first ever computer

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,160
programming curriculum in the united

00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,479
states prison

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,319
in this program students learn html they

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,600
learn javascript they learn css

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,919
and of course they learn python there is

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,280
no internet access in these programs

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,919
so everything is done through thumb

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,160
drives and pdfs

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,520
and this was simon's introduction to

00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,039
programming

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,560
after he got out of prison he went

00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,520
through a coding bootcamp called hack

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,039
reactor

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,400
and then interviewed for and accepted a

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,960
full-time software engineering role with

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,960
my company

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,319
but very few people have access to a

00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,319
program like the last mile it's only

00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,120
running for a few dozen people in 11

00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,880
prisons

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,160
in the united states i mean we have a

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,840
lot more than 11 unfortunately

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,280
and that's a problem because for most

00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,000
incarcerated people becoming a

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,039
programmer

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,440
changes your life it gives you

00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,639
access to the economics of being a

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,360
programmer the cash

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:20,319
the startup equity more importantly it

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,000
connects you with other programmers

00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,400
you become part of a group of people who

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,479
have resources who have power

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,919
and who are used to living in a world

00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:31,360
that we know we can change

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:33,440
because we do it every day at work

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,520
programmers fix stuff for a living we

00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:39,120
are great at fixing broken systems

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,000
and i think it's worth dwelling on where

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,919
that sense of empowerment and agency

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,160
comes from it is deeply ingrained

00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,840
in our open source culture in particular

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,400
that we have the power to take things

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,080
apart

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,319
and change them and fix them and make

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,720
them better and share those improvements

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,759
with the world

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,840
that is an incredibly powerful mindset

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,479
and we mostly apply it to software

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,639
systems it's how python exists guido saw

00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,800
a need for a new kind of language

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,560
that was open source and intuitive and

00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,720
easy to learn and powerful

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,599
and he and many other people works

00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,360
together to make it so

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,199
it's why we have this rich ecosystem of

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,199
python libraries and why we have this

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,400
incredible international python

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,039
community

00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,360
it's why we have not just python 2 but

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,280
also python 3.

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,919
we believe that we can change things and

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:34,560
make them better

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,200
so where i start getting really excited

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,479
is

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,800
when we take these tremendous

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,120
capabilities the collective resources

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,240
and power and the confidence that we can

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,560
change things

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,839
and direct that not just towards

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,120
software systems

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,959
but also to people systems because a

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,440
programmer's mind is really an activist

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,760
mind

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:58,800
we can't even help it

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,519
this is a video of simon getting his

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,360
ankle monitor removed

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,920
so for many months after he was released

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,240
from prison simon was required to wear

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,800
an ankle monitor at all times to track

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,279
his location

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,640
while on parole after serving nearly two

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,360
decades in prison

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,560
newly hired into his first software job

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,279
despite being under

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,959
24-hour surveillance by the state simon

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,279
wasted no time

00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,640
leveraging his network his new network

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,160
of software engineers

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,399
to help change a system that has

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,399
brutalized him and so many other people

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,560
the first thing simon did was bring more

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,600
talented formerly incarcerated people to

00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,279
pilot

00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,360
changing the economic circumstances for

00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,519
several families

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,600
he led the creation of a mutual aid

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,519
network the bay area freedom collective

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,560
that has raised over fifty thousand

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,279
dollars to provide

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:53,279
re-entry support housing and employment

00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:56,240
to people getting out of prison

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:58,320
as a company inspired by simon we have

00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,680
organized around campaigns to change

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,560
legislation

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,240
in our state around incarceration we

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,480
have led campaigns to free

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,480
vulnerable people from prison during the

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,839
covid19 epidemics

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:14,079
and we have succeeded we now run coding

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,680
workshops to help last mile graduates

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,640
prepare for software engineering

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,399
interviews

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:22,240
and we're helping formerly incarcerated

00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,240
entrepreneurs start their own businesses

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,079
and this is just the beginning and it's

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,160
not just simon

00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,640
this is my friend emil who now works at

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,720
pilot 2 and is a prison abolitionist and

00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,720
community organizer

00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,760
this is my friend shaw who now runs a

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,279
media company

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,880
centering the perspective of formerly

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,920
incarcerated people in discussions of

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,959
current events

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,959
through videos and podcasts

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,000
there are so many talented people in our

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,240
prisons if they

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,800
had the resources to change the world

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,800
they would

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,760
and we can help make that happen so that

00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,800
brings us back to how we

00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,839
tech people can meaningfully change

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,839
a criminal justice system

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,720
so inspired by simon as an exercise

00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,959
let's talk concretely about what each of

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,800
us can do to change a system like this

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,320
and the system in your country might

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,160
look really different from mine

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,959
but i think it's still an interesting

00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:19,519
and useful exercise to practice thinking

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,079
concretely about how we can engage with

00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,000
a big

00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,000
broken people system that must change

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,440
so when we get a large ambiguous

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,560
engineering project

00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,320
the first thing we do is a little

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,839
planning and decomposition a breakdown

00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,680
of what problems we're trying to solve

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,519
and approaches to solving them

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,800
so first things first what is a

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:44,079
non-overwhelming way of thinking about

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,000
criminal justice mass incarceration um

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,279
what's a non-overwhelm overwhelming way

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,800
of thinking about these topics and then

00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:52,480
some practical goals we could have

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,160
together and as individuals within it

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,600
and here's a framing that i have found

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,959
helpful for myself

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,959
breaking it down between opportunities

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:01,200
for systemic impact and individual

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:04,320
impact

00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,519
for systemic impacts my goal

00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:10,000
is decarceration changes to how we as a

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,320
society think about crime and punishment

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,079
that lead to legislative changes that

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:17,839
lead to decarceration fewer people

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,839
incarcerated for less time

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,519
for individual impact by the data two

00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,200
things

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,920
that matter the most are housing and

00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,760
employment a safe supportive stable

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,279
place to live and a stable job that

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,639
ensures that you'll have the money to

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,639
take care of yourself and your family

00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,200
technologists should be great allies in

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,399
the pursuit of these goals

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,480
we have access to great jobs tech as a

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:45,760
sector is perpetually hiring which is

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,760
not true everywhere else we have skills

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,760
that are useful we are tech savvy

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,880
we have technical skills we can teach

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,120
other people

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,360
we know how to make things go viral on

00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,959
the internet

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,720
and third we have money generally

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,600
speaking this is a financially

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,600
privileged group

00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,519
and so as technologists i'd frame up

00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,000
three categories of opportunities we

00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,800
have to

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,519
affect systemic and individual impact as

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,360
individuals

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,200
as as any old human being who cares

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,240
about this topic as technologists

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,800
specifically

00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,800
and then also in partnership with our

00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,399
employers

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,680
so as individuals there are a bunch of

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,160
things that we can do

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,040
um first and foremost we can directly

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,160
support

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,160
people leaving prison

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,079
at least in california at least in my

00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,480
country many people

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,839
who get out of prison don't have any of

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,880
the basic things that we use to get by

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,240
in society today

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,800
you don't have a cell phone you don't

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,399
have a computer

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,720
this may sound remarkable but it is

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,240
literally true in california

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,240
it doesn't matter if you have been

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,160
locked up for 40 years

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,320
the way that this works is when you get

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:57,600
out you're given 200

00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,120
and a ride to a bus stop and that's the

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,959
support that you get

00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,440
to make it on your own direct support

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:10,000
for people leaving prison is a really

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,000
really important way that we can show up

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,480
once people get out bridging this

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,480
huge gap left by the government local

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,480
re-entry programs do the hard and

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,959
important work of helping people

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,519
with housing with job searches staying

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,320
sober

00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,440
staying safe and a lot of other things

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,279
and most of this work is done by

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,480
volunteers

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,320
a lot of the work doesn't require a

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,360
special background this is work like

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,959
helping people

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,199
write resumes learn how to use a cell

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,680
phone learn how to use a computer

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,480
um you know we could all be one of these

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,480
volunteers

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,240
and then finally as individuals we can't

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,160
forget the reality that our criminal

00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,680
justice system is unfortunately a highly

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,040
politicized system

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,120
and one of the ways to change it is

00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,000
through who we elect as our

00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,399
representatives and public officials

00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,360
so it's really important that we vote uh

00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,560
especially

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,880
uh for positions that can impact

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,079
uh the way that our prison systems are

00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,199
run

00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,199
and who gets sentenced and how

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,839
so that's the story is individuals on

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,440
top of what we can do as individuals we

00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,160
have ways that we can uniquely

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,680
contribute

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,199
as technologists and the first which

00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,199
we've sort of already alluded to is the

00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,720
first is tech focus job training and

00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,040
re-entry

00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,760
inside and outside of prisons inside of

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,000
prisons

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,759
in the united states we can volunteer

00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,120
with programs like the last mile and

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,440
maybe you have something

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,639
similar in your country or maybe there's

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,880
an opportunity

00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,320
to make something like this grow or come

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,360
into existence

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,839
but um you know pre-release

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,279
uh job readiness skills really really

00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:49,600
important

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,360
and then outside of prisons uh you know

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,959
a lot of re-entry programming is about

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,240
tech literacy it's about how to use a

00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,120
cell phone how do you use an intern how

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,839
to use the internet

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,120
how to write an email well uh you know

00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:00,079
how are you supposed to get a career

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,000
building job

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,279
if you don't know how to type or if you

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,360
don't know how to use a computer to

00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,800
complete an online application

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,399
with confidence so having enough

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,240
support for these types of skill

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,240
development is really really important

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:21,040
and then i want to specifically call out

00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,000
another area of opportunity that is of

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,839
um

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
exceptional relevance to this group of

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,120
people and that is programming boot

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,199
camps

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,240
i mean this is really intersects with a

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,399
lot of the work

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,000
on diversity and inclusion that this

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,160
community is already doing

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,759
boot camps and more generally software

00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,519
engineering training for people who want

00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,680
to make a career transition

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,440
are providing are proving to be an

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,040
important re-entry opportunity for

00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,920
people coming out of prison

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:50,000
um regardless potentially of the of the

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,399
prior career that you had prior

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,920
to incarceration and the skills that you

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,600
managed to develop in prison if you can

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,839
get into a programming boot camp

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,040
that can really change your life so it's

00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,440
important that we're thoughtful about

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:05,360
what opportunities folks have

00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:08,799
to engage with these types of programs

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:10,959
and finally re-entry and reform work is

00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,559
mostly done by small local non-profits

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,839
and these groups desperately need tech

00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,919
support

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,760
building and maintaining a website

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,959
migrating to modern cloud-based

00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,240
collaboration tools

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,679
etc they very much need our help um they

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,280
you know we should help them so that

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,880
they can spend all their time

00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,480
focusing on getting the actual message

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,320
and the change out and not you know

00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,320
debugging

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,600
whatever you know website configuration

00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,880
issue they're having so this is another

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,440
way we can really show up for it for

00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,440
these groups

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,080
uh okay and then finally we have the

00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,039
last the third bucket and honestly the

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,280
most important

00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,960
bucket and that is what can we do as

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,240
employers

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,760
and i say that this is the most

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,440
important thing because this is where

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,720
the greatest

00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,600
economic impact lives uh that's my

00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,120
belief at least

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,120
and it's a really simple thing it's just

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,720
that we need to hire people with records

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,280
the number one thing that we can do is

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,880
we need to hire people with records

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,400
and i want to highlight a couple of

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,080
specific table stakes

00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,760
issues on this topic

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:13,440
and you know the details of this may

00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:14,080
change from country to country but i

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,919
suspect

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,120
that a lot of this is relatively

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:19,280
universally true

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,640
the first thing we need to do is examine

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,320
how our companies use background checks

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,240
do our companies conduct background

00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,960
checks and if they do

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,120
what do they do with the results do we

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,440
automatically disqualify people who have

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,720
felony convictions

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,000
if we don't know the answers to these

00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,760
questions we should find out and

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,760
organize to make sure that our companies

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,640
aren't blanket disqualifying talented

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,480
candidates

00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,480
because of harmful stereotypes

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,000
the second thing that's really important

00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:49,440
is that people coming out of prison may

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,160
have an educational and career

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,600
background

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,600
different from the candidate pools we

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,520
typically focus on

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,919
if we are blanket disqualifying people

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,799
based on having a particular type of

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,679
degree

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:04,320
attending a specific college experience

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,000
with specific prior employers

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,440
we are throwing out resumes from

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,679
qualified candidates including

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,120
candidates coming out of prison

00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,799
we need to take a hard look at what the

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,480
true requirements are for our entry

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:16,160
level roles does every entry level

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,960
person on a customer support team or a

00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,880
sales team

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,200
or your office management team actually

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,360
need uh you know a 4.0

00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,600
grade point average from a top-tier

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,000
university plus a facebook internship

00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,960
you know probably not you know they need

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,320
to be reliable

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,320
sharp problem solvers with good

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:34,080
communication skills and we

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,600
in turn need to have good training and

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,039
mentorship programs to support

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,919
entry-level employees

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,919
in their on-the-job skill development so

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,919
we need to take a real critical look at

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,480
if our entry-level roles are truly entry

00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,960
level

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:50,400
and if they're really serving to build a

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,400
diverse and inclusive workplace

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,320
and finally if we want to hire people

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,840
with records

00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,799
we need to spend time with people with

00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,480
records who are looking for jobs

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,919
and this is the point that ties together

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,480
all of the other activities we've talked

00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,360
about

00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,000
making a difference usually requires

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,799
building

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,799
relationships

00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,440
in the united states what i recommend

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,200
doing is volunteering with job training

00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,240
and re-entry programs inside or outside

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,240
of prisons that's an

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,760
easy way to meet and build relationships

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,640
with people who have the skills and

00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,760
attitude for the roles you're hiring for

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,440
if you do an internet search for

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,400
re-entry programs in your city or in a

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,000
nearby prison

00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,760
you will find everything from academic

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,679
classes to interview practice

00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,880
to resume building workshops to tech

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,480
literacy training

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,320
all of these programs are trying to get

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,000
people out and into good jobs

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,120
and all of these programs need

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,120
volunteers like us

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,240
and when you start hiring people with

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,000
records you start hiring people like

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,280
simon

00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,919
and you start taking the system

00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,799
personally and you become intolerant of

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,880
the injustice

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,120
and you start organizing and you start

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,320
acting and before you know it you can't

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,320
help but change the world

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,200
now maybe prisons aren't your thing and

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,679
that's fine but we've all got something

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,919
in our country in our community a big

00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,120
people system that is unjust and must

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,760
change

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,799
and i hope this talk was a reminder that

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,840
we have the power

00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,840
and we have the resources to change it

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,000
if you'd like to learn more about

00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,280
prisons in the united states i recommend

00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,880
listening to currently informally

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,640
incarcerated community members

00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,400
here are some of the people leading the

00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,440
conversation on prisons

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:34,400
in the u.s there are some really

00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,360
um talented community organizers on

00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,960
twitter

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,640
uh and then i've linked to the patreon

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,240
pages uh for

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,240
shaw who i had referenced earlier in

00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,200
this talk and then also for the bay area

00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:45,200
freedom collective

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,360
simon's organization i would love if you

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:49,600
would check those out

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,280
and with that that is python in prison

00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,559
how open source can change a criminal

00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,640
justice system

00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,559
thank you for listening and i look

00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,200
forward to hearing about what big people

00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:00,159
system

00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:13,840
you are tackling in the year ahead thank

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:13,840
you so much

00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:23,440
all right that was a very powerful talk

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,480
uh so uh so do you want to answer some

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,000
questions now

00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:31,280
yeah absolutely let's do it all right so

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,520
here's the first one are

00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:35,120
are there any considerations regarding

00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,679
the box

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,120
many companies include on their

00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:44,720
application regarding

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,720
felony convictions is a reassuring note

00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:50,880
that's sent along with it helpful

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,720
uh so i want to make sure i understood

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,840
that can you um

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,840
sorry can you repeat the question

00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,960
uh okay

00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,919
are there any considerations regarding

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,320
the box

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,559
that many companies include on their

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,360
application regarding felony convictions

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:13,360
is a reassuring note along with it

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,240
helpful

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,440
uh perfect yes so um uh at least in the

00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,799
united states and again

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,640
this is i'm sure various country to

00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:23,760
country in the united states

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,960
um depending on what state you're in

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:29,679
uh employers or potential employers can

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,980
ask you about your criminal history and

00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,240
can

00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,679
[Music]

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,039
use that information to discriminate

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,080
against you before they've really

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,080
interviewed you

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,520
and in some states that's actually been

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,679
made illegal because

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:46,159
it ha has such negative consequences

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:47,679
uh for people who have records but have

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,840
served their time

00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,679
um and you know have are back out in

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,200
society and still need to be able to get

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,559
a job and pay the bills and take care of

00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,320
themselves like anybody else

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,400
um so some states like new york for

00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,360
example have passed legislation to ban

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,360
the box

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,880
where you can't ask about if people have

00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:06,080
a felony conviction

00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,720
um prior to um

00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,760
making them an offer uh so that that's a

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,520
really important

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,520
you know that it's it's a small piece of

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,960
the bigger story but it's important that

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,080
we are giving

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:21,520
um talented candidates um a real shot

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:25,200
during job interviews without prejudging

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:27,279
them based on something from their past

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,279
yeah so that's really important more

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,279
states should adopt that legislation

00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,039
in general there are significant

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:36,000
barriers to

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:38,559
employment it's not just that but um the

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,720
the broader topic of how to

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:41,919
um i mean if you don't want people to go

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,720
back to prison they need to be able to

00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,799
get a good job

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,000
right so like what if we had to envision

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,520
from the ground up what

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,279
kind of system would um facilitate that

00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,720
and that's a win-win-win that's about

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:54,880
reducing crime rates

00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,559
and improving um you know sort of

00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,080
building successful communities

00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:59,919
if we if we could start from the ground

00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,440
up and invent a system that really

00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,240
ensured that everybody was able to get a

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,480
good job

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,919
that could pay the bills what would that

00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:15,679
system look like because it definitely

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:17,600
wouldn't look like our current system

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,600
um i see a question in the q a box

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,919
should i yeah yeah yeah

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,200
so here's the next question have there

00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,919
been studies done

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,240
comparing recidivism rates among those

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,919
that

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,360
have been through programs such as the

00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:32,240
last mile and those

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,799
who are without such programs if so do

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,799
people

00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:38,640
and politicians listen to that data

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,240
yeah it's a great question and there's

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,440
there's a bunch to unpack in this

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:47,080
um so first recidivism rates are

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:49,440
that's a you know a specific um

00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:50,720
quantification of people who get out of

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,039
prison and then return

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,559
to prison for some reason and there's a

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,360
lot that there's a whole

00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,679
separate conversation about how to do

00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,120
that

00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,960
in a way that is useful because um

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:05,120
it what timeline we're talking about

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,240
matters what was the nature

00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,080
of the of the activity that caused a

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,080
return to prison was it similar

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,120
or different from the original offense

00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,159
there's a bunch of stuff we could break

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,559
down on recidivism

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,679
but um the long and short of it is that

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,919
in the united states

00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,440
recidivism rates are very high um in

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,520
general uh

00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,039
it like you know for the total sort of

00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,159
prison population

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:30,000
um a lot of people return to prison

00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,520
that's not because they're bad people or

00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,799
because they um

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,400
there's something sort of inherently

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,320
criminal about them it's because the

00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,679
system is set up

00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:43,200
to cause people to return to prison

00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:45,440
in particular um the most common reason

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,120
why somebody who's in prison might get

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,240
out and return to prison

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,919
is because um the underlying issue

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,480
that drove their original criminal

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:57,120
behavior was a drug problem

00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,520
and let me tell you uh a prison is not a

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,880
good

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,480
place to address uh addiction

00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,919
it's a terrible place to address

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:07,120
addiction um

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:10,159
and so it's no wonder that

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,960
if you were an addict going into a

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,919
prison

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,240
that in many cases it's very difficult

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,279
to get the support you need for that

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:20,480
to really materially change um by the

00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,399
time you get out

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,000
so you know we could imagine a like a

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,640
totally different way of handling

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,600
addiction

00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,039
in our country that does not involve

00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,080
shoving people into a prison system

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,880
that's not going to take good care of

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,919
them

00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:37,039
right um so that's like one example of

00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:38,880
a sort of obvious reason why recidivism

00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:41,520
rates for one particular

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,600
population um are high it's because the

00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,720
way that we handle this is stupid

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,919
um now uh the question was originally

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,600
about you know do folks who go through

00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,279
the last mile do they have

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,799
better outcomes and the answer is

00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,480
definitely yes

00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,240
um because it's all about being able to

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,080
get a job like if you can get a good job

00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,520
after you get out

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,000
you're not gonna you're not good like

00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,559
there's no

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,600
um the underlying circumstances that

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:08,720
might cause

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,919
um like a need to try to take care of

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,200
yourself in some way that could cause

00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,840
you to end up back in prison they just

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,600
go away

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,880
if you can take if you have a good job

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,240
so folks who are and it's not just the

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,760
last mile but if you you know

00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,440
if you have like job skills that you

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,039
actually get hired for if you were able

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,600
to get a college degree while you were

00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,360
in prison

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,480
all of these things are are like highly

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:29,679
correlated with successful outcomes

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:32,320
uh so yes so educational and employment

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,679
are a big big piece of reducing

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,360
recidivism

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:36,640
um but the other thing that's important

00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,480
to highlight though is that a lot of

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,120
folks if we just did a reasonable job of

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,559
taking care of people

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,279
you gotta remember this is united states

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:47,840
like we don't have universal health care

00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,440
we have we have like a very weak social

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,039
safety net so this is true of anybody

00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,559
not just people coming out of prison

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,240
like if you fall on hard times if you

00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:57,679
can't get a job you're in a really

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,120
tough spot and so if we you know this is

00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,039
part of why i care so much about talking

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,399
about prisons is it's a lens for talking

00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:05,520
about broader social change

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:06,799
it's a problem that people don't aren't

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,200
guaranteed

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:10,559
shelter and food and health care in this

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,640
country

00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:14,080
and one way that we see this manifest is

00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,279
in poor outcomes for people coming out

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,760
of prison

00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,880
um but so yes the last mile helps

00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,679
education helps

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,200
it's also the case that though um

00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:24,720
criminality is something that

00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,520
uh is basically a thing that young

00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,200
people do people age out of criminality

00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,200
like the fact that we have people uh you

00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,600
know spending their entire lives or

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,320
many decades in prison in the united

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,760
states

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:40,720
is is purely the result of

00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,559
sentencing policies that were set not by

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,760
criminology experts they were set by

00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:45,360
politicians

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,799
looking to be tough on crime so they

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,760
would get elected

00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,880
like the whole system this system was

00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,520
not designed

00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,240
to be effective this is not an optimized

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,720
system

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,360
it's one that is simply excessively

00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,919
punitive

00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,559
and is not effective so there's a whole

00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,960
i mean we could

00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,600
we could talk about prison for for days

00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,399
but

00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,240

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:37,120
is i have gone through some

00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,480
interview prep with her and she's

00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,240
actually gonna start interviewing for

00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,640
software engineering jobs

00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,760
um in the bay area starting next week

00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,360
she's like ready to go

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,880

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,360
pass these interviews she's

00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,399
super sharp she's a great she's a great

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,080
programmer

00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:54,799
um this is a great example of someone

00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,799
who uh

00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,039
you know she she was in a different

00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,600
career prior to her incarceration

00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:03,360
she's uh i think she's in her 40s now so

00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,000
this is in many ways like a classic

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,559
example

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,320
of someone who is making a career pivot

00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:12,080
to software you know after doing

00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,880
something else for the earlier parts of

00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,120
her life

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,880
and she's going to be great she's going

00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,399
to be great i just got

00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,679
i just got worried about um some

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,559
interview prep for her and i'm really

00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:22,799
excited about

00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,159
that so yes the last mile is in is in

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,840
some women's prisons again

00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,679
it's a very small program though the

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,679
vast majority of people

00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,120
2.3 million people in california sorry

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,640
in the united states are incarcerated

00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,320
you know the couple of dozens of people

00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,080
who get to benefit from the last mile

00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:39,360
are very fortunate individuals

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,000
but to me that's a testament to i mean

00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,679
it works

00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,840
so how do we expand it how do we get

00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,399
more people access to more opportunities

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,240
like this

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,720
that set them up for real success when

00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,720
they get out

00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,840
uh great

00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,840
