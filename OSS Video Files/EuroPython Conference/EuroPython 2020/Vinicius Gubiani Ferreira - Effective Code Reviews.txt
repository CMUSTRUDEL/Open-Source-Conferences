By Vinicius Gubiani Ferreira

Does your company uses code review? In this talk I will demonstrate why it should start using them immediately, share the many benefits and situations we've gone through, besides good practices that should be used for effective code reviews, that add quality to the product/service that is being delivered.

yes i am right now it's 10 45.

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,680
is this the first euro python event

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:49,440
you've been to i have yet it is

00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:53,920

00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,560
oh great thanks well okay

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,720
let's do this guys i'll be talking today

00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,960
about effective code reviews

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,079
the edge between hard skills and soft

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,240
skills

00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,159
for those who don't know who do not know

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,880
me this is my first

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,320
first aeropython conference i work at

00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,399
asean technologists

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,640
which is an edge platform to build and

00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:48,000
roll low lantern c applications

00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,240
in real time data analysis i am a

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,439
python backend developer at azure

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,040
technologies

00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,479
i am slash was a cyclist at least before

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,840
the pandemic

00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:02,560
i'm a tv and movie series lover

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,000
addicted to quality assurance and an

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,079
open source contributor

00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,479
i contribute on a daily basis to the

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:11,200
python portuguese documentation

00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,239
because here in brazil the not everybody

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,680
speak english

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,239
so that was the best way i can fight to

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,440
help

00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:22,480
on a very frequent basis

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,920
and according to github i'm also a guy

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,280
that invests a lot of time

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,480
into code review this graph is

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:32,720
maybe a bit outdated is about a year

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,760
a year something ago it might have

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,800
changed a bit

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,400
maybe a bit more scaled something to

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,959
commits nowadays

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,879
but you can check it out how it is right

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,760
now at my github profile at the end of

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,760
this presentation

00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,360
so what this called reveal talk is all

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,720
about uh

00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,800
resumed version is uh co reviews

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,840
are a software quality assurance

00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,319
activity

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,120
in which one or several people check a

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,319
program

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,120
mainly by viewing parts of the code and

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,159
it's hearing

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:11,519
tutoring the present the

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,879
the coding itself are at the end and one

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,400
of the authors

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,159
one of the people involved is not

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,879
exactly the author

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,159
that sounds simple right well not

00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,239
exactly because

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,480
actually machines are predictable and

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,840
human beings are not

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,480
so i'm gonna tell a bit of a story

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,040
once upon a time a developer goes to

00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,720
work

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:38,400
start his day and he sees some really

00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:41,680
bad code which is really really hard

00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,920
to work on it's ugly and

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,360
place your favorite adjectives over here

00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,360
on how you like to call

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:52,319
bad code and that guy decides to be

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,760
brutally honest about the author that

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,879
wrote the code

00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,159
and sometimes tell to him directly or to

00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,959
the whole company

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,319
expressing sometimes the coding skills

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:07,280
of the alter

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:09,599
or the nasty work that has actually done

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,319
and if that happen every now and then

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,480
with a

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,439
higher frequency eventually that

00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,920
developer

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,120
is let go of the company and have to

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,040
find a new job

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,519
even thought that person is a great

00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,479
programmer know the language and all the

00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,560
frameworks from

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:29,520
a to z etc that might be one scenario

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,160
another possible scenario is that that

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,800
person

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,000
is really really annoyed with the bad

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,639
codes that he see

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,479
frequently but decide to keep his

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,600
opinion for himself

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:44,639
and that leads to frustration

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,680
anger management and sometimes

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,120
deep obscure desires to hurt or even

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,919
murder somebody else

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,440
usually the cold altar i mean look at

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,000
this guy he seems

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,160
distressed he's smashing those sheets of

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,080
paper really really as hard as his can

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,520
but that's not actually gonna make the

00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,759
code better

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,800
believe it or not i use it to feel like

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,919
this guy

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:09,759
uh before working with code reviews i

00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:12,479
work at that with companies

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,199
that didn't have code reviews developers

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,479
just

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:19,280
passed it forward called forward like

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,160
get it done with the task without too

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,000
much

00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:27,759
quality assurance on top of it and uh

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,400
that uh was really annoying so

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,120
the objective is this talk is to help

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,080
you guys

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,639
out with uh lessons learned so you don't

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,280
end

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,840
like this guy or the previous guy that

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,400
is

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,960
fired or you have to go to therapy

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,240
because

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,240
you are stressed from work

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,479
so code reviews why do they exist

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,800
mostly for these reasons for

00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,360
transmitting knowledge lots of companies

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,080
have

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,759
what they call the bus factor which is

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,039
when a project only have

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,039
a single car developer and that can be

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,479
dangerous for the company because if

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,479
that developer

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:11,520
goes on vacation uh quit his job

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,199
or in the worst case literally gets hit

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,600
by the bus and dies

00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,479
then the project sometimes dies along

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,000
with him

00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,840
so to train the next generation of

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,800
developers in the company

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,280
that you have to pass knowledge on and

00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,280
code review is awesome for that

00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,400
to stimulate collaborations into the

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,199
project

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,319
to ensure that your changes are on the

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,880
right track

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,560
because every now and then you think you

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,680
are done with a task

00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,639
you ship it off for code review and uh

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,720
turns out that you didn't understand the

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,520
task very much and you have to

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,720
either do it over from scratch or redo

00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,560
it like

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:57,199
30 50 percent of it so

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,000
that also helps from preventing you from

00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,599
having to

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,319
do it over from scratch to have good

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,280
practices

00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,599
when coding and to ensure we have good

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,759
quality on the final product

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,599
you can see that i scratched out code

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,639
because in most companies

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,280
including azure code is not exactly the

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,199
final

00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,199
outcome what the client is actually

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,919
demanding code is more like

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,240
a meaning to achieve something it's a

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,800
two

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,960
let's call it that way so

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,400
laying out three golden rules for

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,120
healthy code reviews

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,319
and by healthy i actually mean you don't

00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,639
end up stressed

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:39,280
like the guy banging his head against

00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:42,720
the wall or fired

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,360
a first rule is don't take any comment

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,639
as a personal offense i had a teacher

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,479
which used to say

00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,479
smooth with people and harsh with

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,840
problem there are a lot of people

00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:56,560
that with just one two or a few comments

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,319
already changed to a defensive position

00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,720
which sometimes is not

00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,720
actually actually defensive is more like

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,360
uh an offensive position

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,000
like they are almost starting a fight

00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,199
with you

00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,160
a little true fight and uh

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,599
my advice in this case is you don't have

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,960
to protect your code

00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,639
like if it was your own child you are

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,120
the author of the code you have

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,080
dna in the code let's call it since you

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,560
are the author

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,759
but in the end you don't own the code

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,639
the owner of the code

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,520
it'll be either the community or the com

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,360
the organization

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,039
or the company that is actually paying

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,080
your salary to write it

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,800
so as soon as you realize that your code

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,279
is not your child then you'll be all

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,240
right

00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:44,480
you'll be more willing to accept advice

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,360
and feedback

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,279
a second rule is listen to feedbacks

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,440
because that sounds dumb

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,120
but most people actually don't want to

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,279
listen to other people

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,040
and there's that popular saying we have

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,040
two years and one mouth

00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,040
therefore we should listen twice as much

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,519
then we speak right

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,519
in the end you realize that you

00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,480
everybody works for the same company

00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,320
with the same goals or and objectives or

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,920
almost the same goals and objectives

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,600
depending on the team

00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,920
and everybody is there to help each

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,320
other out but of course since you will

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,519
be participating in code reviews

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,320
you have to you don't you you have to

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,040
differ

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,320
feedback from i will screw you back

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:29,120
because

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,320
uh if somebody was harsh with you you're

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,680
not supposed to

00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,080
pay them back into the same currency so

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,440
don't screw somebody else back because

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,600
you think they were unpolite with you

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,279
and a third golden rule is accept the

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,360
fact that you might be wrong

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,600
because after all being part of being

00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,320
human is making mistakes

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,519
in the end after a while you realize

00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,080
that teamwork

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,680
is much better than being a lonely wolf

00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,160
a bounty hunter

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,480
or has some human resources like to call

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,680
it a rock star a ninja

00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,560
uh rocket scientist developer whatever

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,360
they call it

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,160
i see it every very often even if you

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,800
truly are

00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,240
a rock star or ninja those people

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,120
usually are right

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,880
90 95 percent of the times so there is

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,720
still a small percent of times where

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,720
they are actually wrong

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,040
so this is known as chuck nodder

00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,000
syndrome or i never fail

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,640
my advice for these people is be humble

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,720
and

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,480
because that will create a better image

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,360
of you for your team

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:37,279
you knew we need it when you don't know

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:40,399
how to do something a specific task

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,839
so regarding feedback most of the

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,800
feedback we give

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,000
it's to be honest will not exactly be

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,800
pleasant feedback

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,519
it will mostly be halting a delivery of

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,480
a task

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,040
or negative feedback so every now and

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,079
then

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:59,440
we have to say some nice words for good

00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,480
things that you find into requests okay

00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,800
nobody is in

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,399
fourth grade in kindergarten anymore so

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,680
they don't have to say

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,279
uh nice words all the time

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,959
but every now and then when you see

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:14,320
something you really really liked

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,399
use words such as good job awesome

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,360
entering to if you're into gaming you

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,200
can also say

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:25,600
stuff like flawless victory ko monster q

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:28,560
any other uh approval phrases

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,560
if you're not confident into the context

00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,120
of a pull request to approve or reject

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,440
it

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,000
you can use acronyms such as looks good

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:39,040
to me in my honest opinion

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,040
that is a way you do it back at you

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,160
and since school reviews every now and

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,279
then are

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,920
sometimes nervous and tense moments

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,800
you can always light the mood using

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,639
emojis

00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:56,320
mimi's left phrases such as this one i

00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:58,800
brought from previous times in this case

00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,440
my body was being maybe too much

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,760
redundant since he had in a single line

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,800
three four times the word choice choice

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,360
choices

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,880
and i decided to use this mimi to

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,320
explain to him he was

00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:15,040
maybe raining in the pool which is

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,959
unnecessary there's already enough water

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,399
in there

00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:23,839
on this case a buddy of mine was

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,040
god knows why trying to check if a

00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,399
variable

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:31,279
somehow some way changed its value and

00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,240
i have no idea why he attempted to do

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,959
that

00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,600
maybe just to get a test passing and he

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,200
forgot

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:42,079
that into the request i just literally

00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:43,040
gave him an upside down smiley emoji

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,399
saying

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:49,360
okay what are you trying to do over here

00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,720
and on this case a colleague of mine

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,240
just reminded that

00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,560
fixing tests is unavoidable since you

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,959
are

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,839
producing new code or changing some

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,800
tasks

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,320
if they break you will have to deal with

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,880
fixing broken tests

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,839
there is a fact from the life of

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,079
developers

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,120
some people every now and then ask me

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,480
how to check if

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:18,160
a code is good or not

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,959
there's not a truly specific

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,680
metric for that i usually consider two

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,880
metrics

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,959
which is the amount of curse words that

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:30,079
you either speak or think

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:32,399
when you are reviewing a pull request

00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:34,880
if you are cursing just a few then it's

00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:35,440
probably good code if you're cursing a

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,560
lot

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,079
and it might not that became very very

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,560
real this image for me

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:44,800
about two three months ago when i was

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,839
reviewing some javascript code

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,880
i deal mostly with back end and python

00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,079
has

00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,360
very nice conventions for the language

00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,560
and frameworks

00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,920
and for me don't work with javascript on

00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,440
a daily basis

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,600
it seems so much more permissive

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,600
allow it like you can do pretty much

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,240
anything you want and i was looking to

00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,279
that

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,760
god no why it was

00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,959
i was laughing in the world at the same

00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,360
time

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,040
and uh another good metric to every

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,040
every now and then we use

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,320
is the amount of comments that is left

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,959
onto the request

00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:26,800
but of course that depends maybe from

00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,800
the size of the request itself

00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,199
so we're talking about good feedback and

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,000
uh

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,240
negative feedback when you are rejecting

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,880
a

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,360
request always explain why you are doing

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,160
so

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,920
because the author or the authors might

00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,320
think that you are not actually being

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,680
reasonable or fair with them

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,560
so reasons for rejecting if you believe

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,279
that

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,279
the issue is not achieving what the pull

00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,720
request is not achieving what the issue

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,199
is asking to

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,079
or you believe that requests will break

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,079
something

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,240
either because of the code that is

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,760
present or because some code that is

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:07,519
missing on the proquest

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:10,480
that is my biggest reasons for rejecting

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,160
uh and besides always explaining you

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,360
have to watch out on how

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:18,560
you will explain for the authors so

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,880
here are a few tips always always

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,079
be nice and try to show some empathy

00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,399
with the author

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:26,880
since he probably put a lot of work into

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,440
it you should try to put yourself into

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:32,959
the author's shoes

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:35,680
use collective words such as us can we

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,199
all instead of the individuals are you

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,079
him her

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,519
individual's terms sound you're like

00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,959
blaming the altar

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,199
which is not the case you're just

00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:48,639
commenting but if you use

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:49,360
uh us can we collective that creates a

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,560
sense of

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,680
synergy and that is trying to you're

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,160
trying to help him

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,639
and you'll notice soon that everybody is

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,800
on the same boat

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,120
if it's going to take a while to explain

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,720
since you always have to try to be clear

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,560
and straight to the point

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,639
you might as well tap on the other

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,560
shoulders if and asking

00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,120
if you have five minutes despair for a

00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,680
quick chat of course that might be a bit

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,160
hard

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,279
doing the pandemic right now but uh you

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,320
can do it using

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:22,000
skype slack or whatever instant

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,920
messengers you guys are using

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:28,000
on your company and uh

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,120
you can always raise questions instead

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,600
of giving the direct

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,399
answer for the author what if you do it

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,800
this way

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,440
it looks more efficient because x y and

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,600
z

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,920
when you raise questions you lead the

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,120
author to thinking about it

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:44,959
when then it you might arrive

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,360
to conclusions that he didn't thought it

00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,360
before

00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,880
when you are the other side being a

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,040
developer of the

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,000
request you have to keep an eye on these

00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,160
things

00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,040
isn't the pull request getting maybe a

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,240
bit too big

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,079
nah a bit too big is it possible to

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,039
break it down into smaller chunks

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:07,880
which are easier and faster to review a

00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:10,880
good size for pull request is usually

00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:13,919
253 la 300 lines of code

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,640
without counting uh style changes such

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,000
as black

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,799
baptiste and isort after that size the

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,120
request starts to become maybe a bit of

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:26,720
a godzilla or megazord

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,280
it becomes tiring to hear it to review

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,200
it

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:34,240
so that sounds an interesting metric

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,520
people ask me can i open it as a whip a

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,559
work in progress

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,480
you can you definitely can because

00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,480
if you're not sure what exactly are you

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,600
doing because let's be honest how many

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,240
times we are sure

00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,640
what we're doing in life i'm not exactly

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:52,000
what i'm doing right now to be honest

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,960
but you can open it as a whip just mark

00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
it as a whip

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:59,440
and preferably open it

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,720
as soon as you pass 50 of the changes

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,840
or 60 percent because if you just

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,799
uh submit your request when it's you

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,200
believe it's done

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,039
you might be totally off tracks and you

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,600
might have to

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,640
get it over from scratch that happened

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,360
with

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,480
me and a buddy of mine a couple of times

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,120
about

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,679
maybe four years ago something like that

00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,120
but

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,120
every now and then that happens

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,200
always place the style changes such as

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,080
black peppery tie sort

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,440
into separate commits why because those

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:37,280
can be automated

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:40,799
using precomit and other tools

00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:43,039
so it's not worth wasting time

00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,000
into discussions like this you can

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,720
automate it

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,360
and you should preferably skip that into

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,360
a code review

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:54,480
prior to opening did you pass the test

00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,640
on your machine

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,120
that'll be nice if you do it locally

00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:02,240
because sometimes for some companies

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,720
uh you might have a cyq so you are

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,000
actually

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:09,520
fighting with people for cpu resources

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,400
so you if you can pass the tests locally

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:15,520
that'll be great because you are doing a

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,679
favor to other people

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,039
is the pull request clear what about the

00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,160
description

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:25,280
or images that show off what

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,799
was changed so it's very very likely

00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,960
that

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:31,120
some of the reviewers will not be from

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,559
your team so they'd not might be up to

00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,360
date with the context

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:37,200
on what's going on what's exchange for

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,760
so you have to describe it

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,760
as clear as possible like if somebody

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,679
that joined the company today

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,080
understand what's going on in this pull

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,080
request

00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,679
is this a new fix or a fit where are the

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,919
tasks

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,520
the some people will demand that on your

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,400
request i know i do

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,280
because every fit and fix should have

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,720
tests

00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:03,039
to either ensure that you are achieving

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,720
the requirements that were desired for

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:10,320
that specific task or that a bug

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:12,320
that we came in to enter the code

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,720
shall never return again at least

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:17,360
hopefully

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,000
and finally you should review your own

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,720
requests

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,520
prior to opening as much careful as you

00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,000
can

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,679
or as i like to call it personal

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,760
consider the next programmer

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,240
up cycle who knows exactly where you

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,039
live because the same way as you don't

00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,240
want to

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:36,240
work with crappy codes like the previous

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,120
guys that i presented the one that get

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,000
fired

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,320
or keep his opinion to himself you

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,679
should always release code that you are

00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,640
proud to work on at least for yourself

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,200
and if you have happens to find code

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,919
that

00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,320
it's not that good improve it even if

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,360
it's

00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:58,320
just one line at a time because your

00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:01,600
buddies will thank you for that

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,840
so uh when opening your request

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,039
always keep an eye on pdb's comments

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,640
that are not

00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:10,480
necessary unsuccessful rebases or merges

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,840
that kind of stuff will save a lot of

00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,880
time into

00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:18,480
back and forth discussions uh

00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:21,200
pipelines cpu time so review your own

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,840
pull request please

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,480
what should you keep an eye on if the

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,720
test or the pipeline is actually failing

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,600
don't waste your time with that because

00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,880
it's probably

00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:36,240
that uh some code will enter to fix

00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,240
the tests or the pipeline so you might

00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:41,760
end up wasting time if you are starting

00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:44,559
to review something that's not passing

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,360
if you see any typos such as comments

00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,400
tests

00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:51,039
variables name classes you can

00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,080
and should comment on that about two

00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,679
months ago

00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,360
a buddy of mine said he didn't

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,400
understood my pull request

00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:01,600
i went to check it out i misspelled

00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,679
not i actually meant to write now and

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,320
after changing that single ladder

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:08,240
he totally got it the meaning of what i

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,679
was trying to achieve

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,679
so asu is a brazilian company

00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,799
but our code base is so written in

00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:19,919
english so every now and then

00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:21,840
portuguese word slips through the code

00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,440
so we have to comment on pull requests

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,840
to keep it on a

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,159
regular basis all everybody in the same

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,159
page

00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,880
logic errors that you should comment but

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,520
of course you have to be

00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,320
sure that there is a logic error into

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,120
that

00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,320
it might backfire if you're not sure

00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,600
suggestion for this

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:46,640
is raise it as a question maybe i didn't

00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:49,200
understood it correct is this okay

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,080
like you're not affirming that is wrong

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,120
you are

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:56,159
raising the doubt and

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:59,120
performance optimizations they are

00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,440
a tough manner to discuss about admit

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:03,280
but

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:05,760
uh if you can optimize small things

00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,000
they might turn out to be very very

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:11,200
beneficial for example

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,240
there is one specific place that you

00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:17,440
might have to hit the database and that

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,080
line runs like 10 000 times in a single

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,799
hour

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:22,080
so if you prevent that from happening

00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,000
you already

00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,559
preserving cpu resources from the

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,559
database

00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,559
again some other stuff that you might

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,799
keep an eye on

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,880
follow style conventions and project

00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,360
architectural guidelines good practices

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,960
and

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,960
for the by the company and the community

00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,960
creates documents inside the company

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,600
asean have several of those

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,799
including for code reviews which this

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,559
talk was originally based on

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,559
the commit message and pull request

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:55,760
titles preferably

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,159
uh i suggest a specific pattern which is

00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,200
a

00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,720
jira or bugtrack issue number followed

00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,320
by a prefix such as

00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:07,360
fix feet docks char and a small message

00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:10,559
all of this fits into 60 or

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,480
50 characters if you can't explain under

00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,960
50 or 60 characters

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,039
there is a good metric to knowing that

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,120
your pull request was too much big

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:22,720
and you should have broken it before

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,720
it's a way of learning

00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,960
you might stumble to situations where

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,159
the author doesn't give up

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:33,200
so my advice for that is is to negotiate

00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:35,520
so you hear a lot of stuff so the spring

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,799
is too long already way behind

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:41,600
and uh that kind of stuff

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,720
and finally don't use force push use

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,120
farsi fleece

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,720
which makes the reviewer's job much

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:50,080
easier

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,880
to sum it up guys code review comes down

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,000
mostly

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:57,279
to people than actually technology you

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,679
have to find a way to express yourself

00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,320
without anybody getting harmed into the

00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,760
process

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:07,360
without hurting anybody's feelings

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:09,520
and uh in the end it's hard because

00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,679
dealing with people is actually harder

00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:15,200
than dealing with machines i guess you

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:16,960
guys will agree with me well

00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:19,600
thanks a lot for the opportunity for

00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,159
speaking at europaiton 2020

00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,799
like would say erazu move to the edge

00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,279
value

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:27,760
merci thank you muchas gracias

00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:30,480
villendenkin

00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,039
and i don't speak russian or chinese if

00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,240
you guys

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:36,640
please pronounce this for me if you have

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,600
any questions at all please contact me

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,240
on discord

00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,799
or any of these means over here i would

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:43,840
love to

00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:46,960
have to see your feedback thank you guys

00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:48,080
thank you very much thank you do we have

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,559
any questions guys

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,520
yes we have something for some short

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:55,039
question let's see

00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:57,919
can you hear me sure okay okay

00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:59,840
the first question uh from thomas how do

00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,960
you balance time effort and depth of

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,840
code review

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,880
how we can avoid scratching only the

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,880
surface of the code

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:15,679
that is a good question um

00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:18,000
i guess we have a room at azul

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,919
which uh the code needs to be approved

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,360
by two persons you can always

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:26,799
place that we do have persons that just

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:30,320
apple approve blindly i believe that you

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:32,880
should that is more like a

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,440
personal feeling i guess the company

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,960
don't

00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,240
force specific time but uh i do admit

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,480
that i uh

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,240
invest a lot of time into code review

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,480
but i already prevented several

00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,120
bugs from going to production i'm really

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,320
proud of that

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,000
okay thank you and one more question do

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,640
you recommend any particular

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,880
tool for code reviews for example a web

00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:01,120
application pull request discussions

00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:04,799
on github or atlassian crucible

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:07,840
sure we use github itself

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,240
for the pull requests of github we also

00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,279
use

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:14,240
git lab we have uh about half

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:16,240
of our repository repositories into each

00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,200
one of those

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,120
i know some people use garrett i think

00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,720
that's the pronunciation

00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,480
there are lots of tools i've been

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,840
looking to automation tools

00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:30,000
i'm not sure if somebody will ask that i

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,279
like them for finding out security

00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,320
issues and uh

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,760
maybe maybe some other stuff but they

00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,799
will not produce

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,559
human readable code that's my feeling

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:44,399
about it

00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:46,640
okay final question from thomas

00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:49,039
can you recommend how to discuss a pull

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,200
request with the owner of a repository

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:53,679
who are acting sometimes like benevolent

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,399
dictators for life

00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:58,240
yes let's see recommendations for that

00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:02,240
case

00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,640
um that depends a lot i'm not sure if

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,039
you're

00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,960
talking about specific open source code

00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,799
or a company code

00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,600
if you great i see you updated the

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:15,039
question uh if you are in the company

00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:17,760
uh i recommend always be polite

00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,880
uh he'll probably fight you back that is

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,240
very common

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,320
but if you truly think that

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,600
something might break if that code

00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,799
follows along

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:31,360
you should maybe involve your manager or

00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,799
even his manager or both the managers

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,760
like the tech leads

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:36,880
because that might happen i seen stuff

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,440
that i

00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,399
i noticed on the pull request he went

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,559
ahead anyway

00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,480
and exploded in production just as i

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:47,039
told him i was just

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,880
i i stayed quiet like took an uh taking

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:51,360
a coffee uh afar

00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,880
just looking at and look at my watch

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,640
that kind of stuff

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,320
okay thank you very much for the

00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,880
questions and for the talk

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,000
and we can continue this in the discord

00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,159
talk channel

00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,840
but at the moment everybody at home

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:10,720
please give some applause together with

00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:10,720
