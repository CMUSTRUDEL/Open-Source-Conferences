PyRT (pronounced pirate) is a raytracer/image generator for Python 3.5 and higher. This project is mainly done with the following in mind:


ray tracing in the Jupyter notebook
Teaching computer graphics and ray tracing
Exploring ray tracing concepts for geo data using Python.
Rendering geo data, including large point clouds.
Implementing new algorithms for rendering large 3D city models.
Creating 3D-Maps from OpenStreetMap data
Server-side rendering / cloud based rendering


In this talk I will present the project and show some examples. I will show how useful it is to create quick 2D animations, such as visualization of different sorting algorithms and I how to create fractals and other graphics. A certain focus is also on geodata therefore I will show how to create a live EarthQuake map using pyRT.
In the last part I will show to use pyRT to create 3D renderings.
