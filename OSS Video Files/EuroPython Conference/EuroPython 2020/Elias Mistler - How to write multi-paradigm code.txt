By Elias Mistler

Python is a powerful multi-paradigm language which combines elements of object-orientation and functional programming. Both concepts can be really powerful if used right. But what if you use them together? It can be pragmatic and very efficient, but things can also get messy really quickly.

This talk explores peaceful co-existence of oo-classes and pure functions in the same code base. The focus is on identifying the right tool for the right job and bringing together the best of both. The main topics are:


Code Structure
Data Structures
State Handling
Multiple implementations


Prerequisites:
There are no formal prerequisites for this course, although it is recommended that participants have a strong background in Python and its code structuring mechanisms, as well as a deep understanding of at least one of the paradigms of OOP and FP.
