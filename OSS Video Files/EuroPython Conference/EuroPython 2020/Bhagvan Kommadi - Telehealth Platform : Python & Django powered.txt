Online

By Bhagvan Kommadi

We have built an AI-powered platform (python &amp; django) for doctor's community and Telehealth support for patients during COVID-19 lockdown. The doctor's community interacts related to cases and triage for different patient cases. They can extend Telehealth support using medical practice management solutions. Patients can order medicines online through integrated pharmacies on the platform. AI Platform has digital, voice, and knowledge assistants to provide information to the doctor. Historical
data is used for predictive analytics by the machine learning platform. The platform helps healthcare enterprises in the following:
1. Deploy voice tech to facilitate clinical documentation
2. Reduce physician's administrative burden
3. Increase patient volume and billable revenue
4. Eliminate transcription costs
5. Voice to increase touchpoints and increase patient engagement

	00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,480
so

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,160
this talk is going to be about

00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,080
telehealth platform

00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,240
is powered by python django

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,400
it's a social network for doctors yeah

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:24,960
that's pretty cool

00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:24,960
um yeah so i can see your slides now

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,640
remember for everyone that is watching

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,760
this talk

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,760
there is a q a button you can click

00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,440
there and ask questions and then at the

00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,280
end of the talk i'm going to

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,719
i'm going to ask those questions to a

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,320
speaker

00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:47,520
so okay i think you're ready to go

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,920
take cover good luck thank you very much

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,680
hi um today i'm going to talk about our

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,360
technical solution and it's

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,000
uh based on a polyglot uh micro service

00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,719
architecture

00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,239
we use python and xango so it's a python

00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,640
and xango powered a platform

00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,360
so what we have is a social network for

00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,880
doctors

00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,360
community where it's almost like a

00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,159
facebook for doctors where doctors can

00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,880
talk to each other and also doctors can

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:18,560
extend tele health solution

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,960
right as a medical practice

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,040
for their clinics or quality clinics to

00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,759
different patients

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,360
and especially in scenarios right and

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,840
this telehealth solution

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,200
has become very popular as you all know

00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,600
and it's catching up

00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,400
and the typical solution is being used

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,040
in terms of

00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,680
not just for uh video consultation but

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,000
also

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,840
for end to end right after the patient

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,960
gets the prescription from

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,720
the doctor uh the patient

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,000
takes the prescription buys the

00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,600
medicines right

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,360
then the lab test needs to be done

00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,920
basically goes there and get the lactose

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,560
done

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,840
and also the it get integrated into the

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,439
system back

00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,920
so when i say end to end all the

00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,439
healthcare ecosystem players

00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,320
are being uh integrated in a particular

00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,079
solution

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,720
so that's the beauty of telehealth

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,039
that's become really popular and we also

00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,520
see

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,200
voice playing a big role in terms of

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,520
being voice assistants visitors and

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,959
digital assistants helping out

00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:22,400
and also in terms of helping out

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:27,280
the doctors are you are having

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,280
a clinical assistant ai clinical system

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,040
so today we are going to look at what is

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,280
the typical patient journey

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,680
and what do patients wants want

00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,760
especially in this kind of scenario

00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,760
and how does telehealth solution really

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,080
help

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,239
and uh what's the telehealth platform

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,760
how does it look like and how does

00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,680
semantic analysis help

00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,519
where we talk about different patterns

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,599
voice assistance

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,959
and speech processing and speaking

00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,159
recognition

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,879
speech types speaker model

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,760
batterization speech engine speech

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,640
analytics

00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,840
digital assistant how to help in taking

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,360
modes

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,840
a little bit on the technology technical

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,440
architecture i'm looking at the solution

00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,000
and what are the challenges which were

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:27,200
faced and a small demo i have and

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,959
what's next how do we go about enhancing

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,200
the daily health platform and what's

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,920
coming up in the technology

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,920
in health care

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,319
so let's look at uh the patient journey

00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,400
the patient typically

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:50,720
is having a fever cold or cough or

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,239
a specific problem who wants to book an

00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,920
appointment with the doctor

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,680
a books appointment and there's a

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,519
appointment reminder

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:02,000
which is creative and you can have

00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,959
being tracked with both of patients and

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,560
doctors

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,560
and if there are any delays coming in

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,560
from the doctor friends you have the

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,319
delays being intimately intimated

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,840
if there any changes you go about

00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,720
managing the appointment changing the

00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,720
point and

00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,000
risk it during the appointments and also

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,680
after the appointment

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,759
there any follow-ups required if you

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,600
have post-appointment engagement

00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,199
so a very simple question i think

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,919
everybody is familiar with familiar with

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,440
this right

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,880
many of the times people would have gone

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,069
to a hospital right and

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,069
[Music]

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,560
a receptionist and you talk to them

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,720
regarding appointment

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,240
you envision yourself going into your

00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,880
hospital

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,240
the same journey you want to put that in

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,280
any health solution

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,880
right on the cloud and on the

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,120
on your mobile applications web

00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,199
applications and instead of reception is

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,440
you take the same process

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,280
and have a digital assistant you know

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,880
the voice of the system help out

00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,280
in the in this spectral process

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,440
now what do patients want let us take a

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,320
step back from the technology

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,800
typically patients want a doctor to know

00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,120
him

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:14,960
or her and they want doctor to be

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,360
competent they want doctors to be

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,320
cared caring about them and improving

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,960
and curing

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,240
and preventing their particular problems

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,360
it can be your daughter

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,560
it could be your wife this is

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,479
this is what a patient typically wants

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,720
from the doctor so how does the

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,639
telehealth solution help

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,280
so from a technology point of view we

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,600
have a webrtc based solution

00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,440
and there's a deep learning based voice

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,880
and also a little bit on historical data

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,720
with patients data

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,800
and predicting identifying patterns and

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,320
we use neural network algorithms

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,240
and if you look at the solution there

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,560
are lot of things which are happening

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,160
but there is a social community for

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,639
doctors where we

00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,400
do take the feeds from the internet data

00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,000
source and do the fact check

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,600
like and have a cms like wordpress and

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,360
then publish blogs

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,639
publish feeds through mobile apps and

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,120
web applications

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,560
and you have recommendation engine cases

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,479
and knowledge engine

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,080
insights and also violet in a payment

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,600
gateway just in case

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:20,160
you want to have what you call

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,759
payments to process for the appointments

00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,600
doctor appointments

00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,840
and also you have transaction engine

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,800
loyalty management curator

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,039
we are also enhancing for supporting iot

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,759
devices that's something radio which is

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,319
evolving the platform has support for

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,520
voice

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:40,639
video sms and also pose

00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:43,440
service and also insights

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,240
so if you look look look at the previous

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,479
slide and

00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,919
current slide and basically on the left

00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,360
and left and right here right you have

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,520
the historical data

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,520
the patient's data the prediction

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,639
pattern which really helps

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,960
a doctor to know the patients

00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,120
and especially the voice assistants

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,840
conversing with the user right showing

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,240
care showing empathy showing emotions

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,039
showing

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,240
sentiments that that really helps in

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,479
terms of

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,280
substituting a digital assistant to a

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,479
nurse

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,479
or a doctor right

00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,400
so how does the telehealth platform look

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,560
like

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,599
right uh in terms of different

00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,599
components of different

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,240
persons getting involved you have users

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,199
you have groups

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,800
you have content and we look at audio

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,720
and video chats which as a

00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,039
important component for daily us

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,560
platform but you have notifications you

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,280
have discussions happening

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,880
between the doctors you have polls you

00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,479
have social interactions

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,879
you have service you have ballots

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:50,160
and also you have courses even news

00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,440
careers

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,840
for the doctors and medical students

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,240
and you bring in employees nurses and

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,879
operation operations

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,840
personnel partners vendors and also

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,800
customers

00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,720
before the users and there are groups

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,639
created within doctors where

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,240
you can have moderation with them or you

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,800
can have group discussions

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,080
or you can have case triage where two or

00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,720
three doctors

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,000
discuss about the case and you also have

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,560
can publish products

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,120
have product reviews taken from doctors

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,560
and

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:26,560
healthcare personnel

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,039
and there is content related to feeds

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,280
news recommendations and there are

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,320
uh blogs and also services which are

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,959
published

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,959
to the content channel

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,719
the semantic analysis like which

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,240
wheelchair was talking about where nlp

00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,000
plays a very important role

00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,360
so that's one of the reason why this

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,440
session

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,839
before we get into the nlp the idea is

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,839
to have understanding for the

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,160
grammatical relationships between the

00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,080
words and phrases

00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,560
so natural language processing which

00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,680
picks up on this you have blogs news

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,440
feeds right so there's a lot of text

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,800
mining and text processing which happens

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,640
behind

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,040
especially in the voice assistant or

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,000
digital assistant or digital notes

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,920
right or prescriptions and if you look

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,240
at i'm just giving a very simple example

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,720
right

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,800
john hit the ball if you have subject

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,600
verb modifier in an object

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,200
and you are trying to identify what are

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,720
the entities here

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,120
what are the verbs here what are the

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:30,480
nouns here simple non-verb analysis

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,480
helps or you have you do entity

00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,440
extraction

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,160
or parts of speech extraction and you

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,440
try to

00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,640
identify the nouns and also sentiments

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,839
is is he is saying he is he talking

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,959
about the ball being hit

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:50,000
really hard or let's say john

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:53,040
got hurt it was was the

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,480
injury bad so if you look at these

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,640
particular adjectives

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,399
you get the positive or negative

00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,760
sentiments like typically you look at

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,120
words like good

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:06,079
great fantastic excellent friendly

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,240
right awesome spectacular and he was

00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:12,079
sometimes negative right he got hit

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,160
hit badly it was the worst shot

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,120
okay there was an issue here there was

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,760
something lost

00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,560
and awful problem burgers these are

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,040
negative

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,040
sentence

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:29,600
now like semantic analysis the other

00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:33,839
key uh section is uh atoms

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,360
we identify patterns in historical data

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,040
so what has happened before in a

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,760
patient's life

00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,800
what i have seen before we also look at

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,440
demography

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,800
we also look at appearance sounds

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,920
physical signs

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,560
smell touch feel images fluids

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,079
tissues right all these are different

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,120
different

00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:57,600
areas where patterns do the analysis

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,640
and there's also mining data mining

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,480
which happens

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,680
in the nodes or in the prescription

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,399
right or in

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,000
or in the speech when the patient is

00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,000
talking over to the doctor

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,120
it is a lot of a lot of discussions

00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,839
happens and the

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,480
patient tries to explain his physical

00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,399
condition

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,640
or his business condition and that's

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:20,320
where right all the patterns

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:23,279
uh analysis really helps now we jump

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,120
into voice systems and you now you have

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:27,600
understood the semantic analysis and the

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,000
patterns so simple voices strength like

00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,200
let's say

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,360
it's on the google dialogflow right and

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,440
you want to look at the doctor looking

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,800
at the patient's report and he wants to

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,880
look at a patient right

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,560
he sends a request and dialogue to

00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:42,880
process that particular

00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,560
simple command voice command and that

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,680
and sends the response back and shows

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,440
the

00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,880
generator report saying that these are

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,680
the list of patients

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,720
now similarly a patient talking to a

00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,040
voice system

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,959
is slightly complex wants to know about

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,600
kobit 90.

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,880
okay so the google dialog flow provides

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,240
capabilities

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,040
like uh keywords like keyword search

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,839
like for example

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:10,480
covered or how does kobit affect the

00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,639
pets

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,519
is having pets are bad that's a bad

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,519
situation

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,200
during kobe or do you and you have

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,120
vaccines for cold

00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,800
you have any medicines already

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,760
identified how do you go about

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,360
preventing

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,839
kobe so all these are simple voice

00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,519
commands

00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,760
being like a keywords being sent as a

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,720
request and google dialog flow tries to

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,160
process them

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,160
and sends the response back

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,560
now how does the whole speech processing

00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,720
work now let's take a step back

00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:45,760
from ai and look at the speech process

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,839
right you look at speech coding so when

00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,839
the speech coding involves synthesis and

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,720
recognition

00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,480
you also have a speaker model the

00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,560
speaker model consists of

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,680
speaker identity and speech

00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,360
transcription

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,120
the speech transcription basically is

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,920
converting speech to text

00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,240
speaker identity is basically the

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,480
speaker profile who is the speaker

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,040
where is he from which language he is

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,360
talking what is his accent

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,279
these are all demographic state what and

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,839
these are all play a very important role

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,880
in terms of creating a speaker model

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,000
similarly speech

00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,680
type you have speech patterns

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,440
you have direction it's also very

00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,200
important speech

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,120
patterns are there are many ways of

00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,560
saying the same thing right

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,839
in a hurry we say we show emotions right

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,760
when you're when you when you're

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,200
presenting formally like the speech

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,720
pattern might be very different where

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,920
when you're informal it might be

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:44,480
completely different from the formula

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,199
then given these challenges where

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,760
there's

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,959
speaker identity accent languages and

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,959
speech patterns

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,480
how do you go about recognizing the

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,920
speech

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,519
there are various approaches you have

00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,360
template based

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,519
word recognition continuous speech

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,560
recognition neural network based

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,560
information

00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,920
you typically have a template saying

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,160
that

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,360
it's going to be very structured where i

00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,560
have agenda

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,959
i talk about what when how

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,240
last i talk about what is next right and

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,000
then present

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,680
so it's very very structured and you

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,839
know what is going to come

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,800
then the recognition becomes much

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,240
simpler

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,680
let's say it's a continuous speech like

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,959
what we are doing discussing you know

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,600
when we are brainstorming there will be

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,279
a lot of

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,519
questions and answers will be there it's

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,240
continuous the neural network-based

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,639
technician

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,320
is basically the next level it's not

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,399
just template or continuous

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,000
the neural network has stability of

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:41,360
learning

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,839
so you have feature extraction

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,720
speech direction vocabulary and

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:49,279
knowledge based acoustic model

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,000
and you have analysis and feature

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,320
extraction

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,360
and extraction modeling and testing

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,959
which is done

00:14:53,360 --> 00:15:01,920
to improve the neural network model

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,560
now what are the speech types in a

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,240
speech

00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,560
you have isolated words you have

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,000
connected words you have spontaneous

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,639
speech

00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,360
let's take a simple sentence john is

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,680
going to

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:19,920
fall so when you say when i say

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:23,279
john is going to fall you see there are

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:26,959
there are words which are broken john is

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:30,560
going to fall let's take a complex

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:33,440
sentence although john was wealthy

00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,880
it was very modest now you see in this

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,399
particular speech

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:41,759
especially after although right

00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:44,560
you you feel past then john was wealthy

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,519
then you say he was modest so there are

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,079
connected words

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,000
there are isolated words broken words

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,600
and there is a spontaneous speech

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,839
there are multiple types of speech which

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,519
needs to be handled

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,279
so what are the different speaker models

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,959
we talked about speaker identity now

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,440
let's look at speaker model

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,000
where there's independent speaker model

00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,759
right

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,199
so especially on zoom you're seeing at

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,240
the bottom right

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,920
it's able to create subtitles it's it's

00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,399
independent of who the speaker is

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:15,199
it doesn't know where am i from where i

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,279
am from

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,040
and in europe python there will be

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:22,399
speakers coming from

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,959
various countries and and it it can

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,360
detect

00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,360
so this model is basically independent

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,320
it is able to detect the speech

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,880
and then turn it into subtitles whereas

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,360
you look at

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,680
dependent model it's very specific to

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,440
about the speaker

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,880
and that particular speaker notes my

00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,759
identity

00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,279
my background demographics and there's a

00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,560
neural network network engine which

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:48,079
keeps on working

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,079
in enhancing the clinics

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,279
now what is dialyzation the derivation

00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,360
is if you look at speech

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,040
being represented on a graphical node

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,279
you see most of the timeline

00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,759
used to record your speech there will be

00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:05,120
almost like a waveform where you see

00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,760
a cluster of right cluster of waves with

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,439
higher

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:12,160
wavelength versus others which are wide

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,120
with the lower wavelength now and break

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,520
you break down

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,160
break those down into different segments

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,480
where

00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,360
there are there are broken what you call

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,240
waves

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,760
or there are pauses take those each

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,039
segment

00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:30,840
translate the speech to text you get

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:32,640
that transcription done that is

00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,440
variation

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,880
now if you look at speech engine now you

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,919
looked at the various components of the

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,600
speech

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,320
processing right now if you look at

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:45,600
speech engine you have audio

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:48,320
and you have what you call the grammars

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:51,120
and acoustic models and ignorance test

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,240
and you have environment which is around

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,919
and the channel

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:58,480
speaker you have style gender age

00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,440
and speech speed and depending on the

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,080
demographics

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,280
right speech speed varies some people

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,640
talk very fast

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,080
some people talk very slow a speech

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,880
engine needs to have capability to

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,440
handle

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,440
both of them

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,160
how about speech analytics so while

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,600
doing the speech processing

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,280
if you prefer to look at emotions before

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,799
you have unit you will need to look at

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:27,840
periods of silence

00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:30,480
and also non-speech for example oh

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,039
think i'm in the middle of the meeting

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,559
and i start thinking that i think

00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:39,760
i need to start looking at the time also

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:43,840
or let me let me take a step back and

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:46,320
think about it and i pause

00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,840
you see the pause there so even though

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,919
it's a very simple sentence

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,360
basically and you look at the time and

00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,480
then i'm in the middle of this but

00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,880
recession

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,840
it looks very fast but let in in bit but

00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,360
this particular

00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,559
segment you break down with different

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:02,720
segments you see non-speech areas

00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,799
so speech analytics processes what are

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,919
the periods of silence

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,880
what are the non-speech areas and what

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,840
are the emotions

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,840
detected

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,320
now let's look at digital assistants

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,760
having looked at the speech recognition

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,080
speech processing

00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,400
how does the speech processing really

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,520
help in digital assistants or voice

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,960
assistants

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,559
now let's start looking at digital

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,840
assistants this is where nlp and

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,080
semantic analysis

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,039
plays important role helps in taking

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,760
clinical notes

00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:47,120
retrieving cases processing commands

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,160
processing sometimes speech

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:53,919
voice commands updating prescriptions

00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,919
creating consolidation apartments

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,919
now let's look at the technical

00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,919
architecture where you have voice

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,440
assistance digital assistants

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,159
that's where the speech processing

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,400
speech engine speech types

00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:08,400
really help and these are all helped out

00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,200
they are all being processed in the

00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,480
google dialog flow they're using ibm ibm

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,559
watson helps out

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,919
which is uh in terms of the speech

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:20,799
processing capabilities

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:22,720
and then supports them on ibm bluemix

00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,240
so from the technical architecture point

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,039
of view the telecast platform which we

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,120
built

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:31,120
has android ios mobile clients

00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,640
it also has services layer built on

00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:37,520
python xango

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:40,320
php java and we have mysql and mongodb

00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,360
as the database mysql is for relational

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:46,000
and mongodb

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,000
is for noise database

00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,799
now what are the challenges in building

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,400
this particular platform

00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,320
so especially when you're building voice

00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,120
systems digital assistants or a video

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,320
platform

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,600
you need to look at the browser's

00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,919
capability you need to look at the

00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:02,720
mobile os dependency

00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,720
right you have desktop desktop os issues

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,559
you have speech hardware issues

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,840
right i don't know how many attendees

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,799
had problems

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,400
uh typically like when you get into any

00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,760
uh conferencing system

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,080
most of the time you have challenges

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:19,440
with the speech hardware and depends on

00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,919
whether you are using windows 10

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,960
it's just the incapable compatibility or

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,720
the driver

00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,000
which are challenging challenging

00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,400
sometimes desktop or

00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,919
sometimes let's say connected to this

00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,280
conference through mobile mobile

00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:35,440
is the mobile os has challenges

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,320
in terms of providing the audio and

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,320
video capabilities

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:45,840
so now let's look at the demo

00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:59,840
so i have the the

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:12,240
so here i am signing up so i have the

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:15,130
mysql started

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,640
i've started the python

00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:19,679
[Music]

00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:23,679
xango server now i'm signing up

00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:27,840
this is the doctor who's signing up

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,840
i just put the doctor's name is dr john

00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:41,840
so now i log in and after registration

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,960
so this has fields now let's look into

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,960
the voice assistant

00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,640
so i say hi and try to

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,440
start the recognition process and said

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,720
hello

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,720
it started detecting hello

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,159
now i send the command hello

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:20,559
so it comes back with the response now

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,559
i started looking at corona

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,919
i'm sending that message i got the

00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,840
response

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,520
so that was about the voice system now

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,679
let's look at the critical assistance

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:59,039
right now you're a doctor and you talk

00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,039
to a patient and you want to

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,799
so i recognize fever and i have

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,600
recommended in paris but tomorrow and

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,200
then

00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:11,840
i have taken that notes now

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,880
i want to have a video appointment with

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:18,159
the doctor so i started the video

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,919
now let's look at the other side

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,000
there's a patient who wants to connect

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,960
to the

00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,840
video system now here i am registering

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,840
as a patient

00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:34,640
and go to the register so now i am a

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,640
patient now

00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:37,679
station.js.

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,440
so i'm just simulating both at the

00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,080
doctor and equation

00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,080
for the demo

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,360
now i log in as patient gmail.com

00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:01,679
i go to video over here and you see the

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:06,960
person logging in

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,960
and you see the person trying to call

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,679
the connection gets established after

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,120
accepting

00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:18,720
when i go back over here as a doctor

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,720
i completed the video session

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:29,840
and i log out on both sides

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,240
so that was the demo we looked at uh

00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,039
demo which has which was powered

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,039
through python xango a platform that's

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:47,279
mysql and html5

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,440
and i use the webrtc for the daily

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:53,120
health and google dialog flow

00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:55,760
for digital and voice assistance

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:56,240
now many people ask i see customers and

00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,360
i see

00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,840
uh in the conferences the one you talked

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,880
about voice resistance digital assistant

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,720
daily health solution what is next

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,159
what what's next in the technology

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,039
friend right and especially in

00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,600
healthcare

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:13,440
or in need or any radio mining in with

00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,120
respect to ai

00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,840
so one of the things which are evolving

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:20,240
is the biometrics

00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,840
other area is the language another

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,480
dimension right and we look at english

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,720
and

00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,919
we have people coming in from uh joining

can you have multilingual speech and

00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,440
similarly

00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:44,960
can you have knowledge assistant which

00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,720
is being which is learning has

00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,320
capability of

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,919
self-learning itself and also

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,760
can you have a connected system it's not

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:57,440
just isolated system

00:26:53,760 --> 00:27:00,559
like we talked about pharmacy and

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,880
labs diagnostics and pathology

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:03,840
and clinics being connected hotspot has

00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,679
been connected

00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,360
and we have all systems being connected

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,279
integration positive

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,720
i think that's the next level let me go

00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,720
to the next the

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,720
highest level where you want to have

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,279
dynamic program creation can you have a

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,399
program

00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:21,600
being created yeah can you have a a

00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:23,360
coder who can create a program

00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,120
before normally we have code we used to

00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,760
have code generator now a

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,440
coder is intelligent in terms of having

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,760
a neural

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,440
network with support where we have

00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,399
neural sketch for different technology

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,159
stacks

00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:38,240
and neural sketch has capability of

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,880
understanding the technology stack

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,200
breaking down

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,520
into various layers what is required for

00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,960
each new layer right what are the domain

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,640
what is the domain and what is the

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,720
domain model what are the entities what

00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,960
are the services

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,640
okay and also what is the affiliated how

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,600
does the process look like

00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,559
now next level from the encoder is what

00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,200
if i don't want

00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,320
or the a coder i would just want to i'm

00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,000
a business user

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,919
i'm a member of the process i'm aware of

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,399
the domain i'm aware of the

00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,240
process steps in the workflow and you

00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:10,720
have various uh

00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,720
what you call

00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,080
users logging in and interacting at the

00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,320
process activity level

00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,000
can i have a no code automation platform

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,799
where you can drag and drop and create a

00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,440
process

00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,240
and it deploys it on the cloud right

00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,360
without

00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:29,760
any code being created

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,840
and says yes and that's the no code

00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,399
automation program which is upcoming

00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,399
so that was a brief presentation which

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:39,600
about our telehealth

00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:45,840
polygon microservices platform

00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:45,840
so any questions any thoughts ideas

00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,240
there was one one question regarding

00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,960
mobile app

00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,159
available on play store yes we have the

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,559
mobile app available

00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:13,840
it's called white codes we have both

00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:16,000
what you call network app and also

00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,360
the telehealth app for many of the

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,600
doctors

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,600
we have we also have a clinic plus

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,960
mobile app

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:29,120
which is available also have a white

00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:29,120
light labeled mobile app for your clinic

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,799
so we have doctors community around 400k

00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:55,840
and uh doctors we have nurses or medical

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:55,840
professionals who use our system

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,120
any other questions regarding the

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,440
licensing model

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:15,279
the doctor's app is the network app

00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:17,840
where we have a social community is

00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,799
there's no licensing it's what you call

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,840
if you're a doctor

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,240
you validate yourself with your medical

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,840
certificate the

00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,360
regarding the payment model for the

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,320
practice plus friend there are multiple

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,880
packages

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,840
which are available for if you go for a

00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,840
web model

00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,840
or if you go for a mobile app model or

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,480
if you go for a white label the

00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,919
app for your quality clinic or clinic

00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,960
there are various packages which are

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,000
available

00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,320
online you can see the website and there

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,919
are

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:51,840
it's called practice plus suit and you

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:51,840
have multiple packages available

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,919
can you as a patient just log on and see

00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,360
any doctor that uses the platform or if

00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,039
you have requested

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,039
specific doctor this is a good good

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:10,080
question so they in

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:13,279
in our platform we have our doctors who

00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,200
refer our patients and the patients will

00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:17,039
be able to go to a specific app

00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:32,960
on the play store install the app

00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:36,399
specific to the particular doctor

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:38,960
so any other questions i think oh

00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,960
there's more

00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,640
so people are asking about

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,200
yeah that's a very good question and we

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,600
look at data privacy

00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,120
very carefully because there's a lot of

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,360
guidelines which are coming

00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,880
from telehealth and we also follow

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,799
people's standards

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,640
and also in terms of the data exchange

00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:06,159
we follow xl7

00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:08,320
and here the fire fha support we have

00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,679
so we take data privacy very seriously

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,399
especially in terms of the patient's

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:15,840
data

00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:15,840
and doctor's information

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,960
okay so we still

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,519
see how a few minutes but in how many

00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,159
countries

00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:32,640
is it used currently we are we are

00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:36,000
supporting uh within india

00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:43,840
so we have plans to go take it to the

00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:43,840
other countries

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,480
so regarding the other countries the

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,000
challenges as you know right one is the

00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,159
telehealth guidelines the country

00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,799
supports so we are looking at various

00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,600
countries

00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,600
within asia

00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,840
okay perfect so

00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:18,159
i think there's no more questions

00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:25,840
so i'm going to say thank you very much

00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:25,840
for for presenting another python

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:36,240
okay thank you very much

00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,120
that was really good there is a channel

00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,960
in this core

00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:44,320
so the name of the channel is talk

00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:46,240
telehealth so if someone wants to

00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,600
continue the discussion you can join the

00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,000
channel there

00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,279
it's in the it's in this course you have

00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:55,600
to go to the brian

00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:58,480
breakouts and then and then you have the

00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,919
the discord channel for for each talk

00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,640
and you can continue the discussion

00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,720
