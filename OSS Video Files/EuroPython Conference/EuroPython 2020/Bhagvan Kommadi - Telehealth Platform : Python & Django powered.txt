By Bhagvan Kommadi

We have built an AI-powered platform (python &amp; django) for doctor's community and Telehealth support for patients during COVID-19 lockdown. The doctor's community interacts related to cases and triage for different patient cases. They can extend Telehealth support using medical practice management solutions. Patients can order medicines online through integrated pharmacies on the platform. AI Platform has digital, voice, and knowledge assistants to provide information to the doctor. Historical
data is used for predictive analytics by the machine learning platform. The platform helps healthcare enterprises in the following:
1. Deploy voice tech to facilitate clinical documentation
2. Reduce physician's administrative burden
3. Increase patient volume and billable revenue
4. Eliminate transcription costs
5. Voice to increase touchpoints and increase patient engagement
