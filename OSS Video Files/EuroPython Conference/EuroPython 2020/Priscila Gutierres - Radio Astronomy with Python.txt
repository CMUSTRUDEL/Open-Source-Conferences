By Priscila Gutierres

Looking at higher redshifts is equivalent to looking back in time: they improve the studies of cosmology, expanding our knowledge of the universe. It allows us to study various physical phenomena like the power spectrum of galaxies which describes the distribution of galaxies on a range of scales, galaxy clustering, and large scales, the detection of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation feature. 
As a result,  a significant amount of work has been done to increase the efficiency and accuracy of the process via new algorithms and optimization of existing ones.
Astronomical datasets are undergoing a rapid growth in size and complexity as past, ongoing and future surveys produce massive multi-temporal and multi-wavelength datasets, with huge information to be extracted and analyzed.
The alternative to a full spectroscopic survey is to obtain multi-color images of the sky and perform photometric redshift estimates for the galaxies we have available. 
When dealing with this problem, there are two main approaches: model-driven data analysis (template fitting methods) and data-driven analysis, which can use machine learning methods.
To solve this problem, we use data-driven analysis, more specifically GPz (which uses Gaussian processes)  and  ANNz2 (which mainly uses neural networks), both python software.

Prerequisites: machine learning and basic math knowledge

	00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,679
uh

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:13,519
restart i i

00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:16,640
i am a master student i working

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:21,039
on radio telescope project

00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:25,519
here in brazil and uh

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:28,960
my task is to reconstruct a red shift

00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:33,040
flat off

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:37,280
faraway objects

00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:40,480
and i will tell you how i do this

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,760
um first you have to know what is a

00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,440
redshift

00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,520
uh to to understand what is redshift

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,879
you have to record what is the doppler

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,800
effect

00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,039
the doppler effect is the changing

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,320
frequency of a waving relation to

00:00:53,039 --> 00:01:00,079
an observer who is moving relative to

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,039
the wave source one example of doppler

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,479
effect shift

00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:07,119
is the change of pitch heard when a bus

00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,760
sounding a horn approaches and receives

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:13,920
from an observer

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:17,119
compared to the empty frequency

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,240
they receive the frequency um is higher

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,400
during the approach

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:26,240
and we it's identical when

00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,720
they sense it pass it's passing by us

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,159
and it's low it is lower during the

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,200
recession

00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:36,479
uh redshift is the light version

00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:40,079
of this phenomenon and you

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:43,119
it whispers it all the time and

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:46,799
we we can we can see if you look at

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:50,000
the sky we we we know that

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:54,240
that that that there is blue the

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,240
blue stars and red stars

00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:01,280
and the the red stars

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,880
are far away from us than the bluest

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,880
ones and

00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,840
because we have we have this

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,120
in the color spreadton spectrum

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:25,120
this frequency is this frequency is

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,720
higher than this and

00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:32,239
uh when we see a

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:35,440
celestial object that there is

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:38,720
red it means that is

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:41,360
moving far away from us in the expanding

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,360
universe

00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:48,480
this is this is this is why we these

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:51,120
one main reasons we stud

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,519
this thing because we want to know that

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,800
if

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,920
the universe is expanding or if he

00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:02,000
it is contracting or if he is

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:05,760
stationary when uh we

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,879
the rebel constant is is a number that

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:19,840
measures uh how

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:19,840
how the universe is expanding

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:31,519
and um the rainbow number

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:34,560
is calculated measuring the

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:38,159
the redshift there are two

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,599
main approaches to uh to

00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:45,680
know the redshift of us a star

00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:48,959
we can do a data driving analysis

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:52,879
is that what i do and we can do a

00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,360
templativity analysis uh using

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,480
physics theory i don't know physics

00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,400
theory because

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,040
i am a mathematician and i in my

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,879
research

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:08,400
i do i use that data and

00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:12,640
use machine two machine learning methods

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,640
to study this phenomenon

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,919
if you use a machine learning methods we

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:21,440
have to have

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:24,320
a training set and

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,800
which we we privileges know well what is

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,840
ha

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:31,840
what is the right right shift

00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:35,040
to to and um

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,560
we have two kinds of data you

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:41,919
you we use in our training set

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,720
we use a spectroscopic redshift and

00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,479
photo z

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:49,440
redshift a spectroscopy

00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:50,400
spectroscopy redshift you refer to the

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,520
measurement of

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:57,520
a radiation intensity

00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:01,120
as a function of our wavelength and

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:04,720
we just use it to describe

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,440
and then

00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,479
all the way out the spectrum all the

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,800
intensity of

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:16,320
all um electromagnetic

00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,759
elements of our atom of

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,639
or of our stars we have uh infrared

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,479
information

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,440
we have uh all the all the other callers

00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,720
information

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,720
and a bunch

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,720
gamma ray information and it's

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,680
it's a complete it's a more complete

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,120
analysis

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:44,320
of uh of an object

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,919
or it could be it can be an

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:51,520
atom or it can be a star

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:54,639
but photo's a redshift to its

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:58,080
so just some colors so some

00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:01,360
we can't just how

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,880
uh is the intension of and

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:08,560
red and yellow blue

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:11,120
and infrared in the stars there are

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,680
many system there there are many system

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,160
of

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:16,160
photos of red shift uh it

00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,080
it depends on the survey and the data

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,840
you you

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:27,759
analyze analyze and for example i use

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:31,680
pen stars data which i have five colors

00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:35,520
and we we call this colors and

00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,960
magnitudes and we we uh compare

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,039
the uh these uh photos and red shifts

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:45,120
you have with five colors

00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:46,000
with uh of the bins of the spectroscope

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,280
data we have

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:54,240
in our training set but

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,240
and frequently we have um

00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:01,280
um many sources

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:05,599
ministers of uncertainty and

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:08,800
some of them are there and we have uh

00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:11,680
a lack of inputs on trade to training

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,120
because we will when we do these

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,759
analysis we

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:21,039
have the map of skies and we

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,199
and it is divided in pixels

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,199
but

00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:31,599
we can okay we can have

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:35,039
but we are comparing and spectroscopic

00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:39,360
uh data two

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:41,919
and redshift q1 and

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,599
there there are some missing galaxies in

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,879
one or another

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:50,160
and we we have

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:54,000
because uh we have we compared

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:58,000
two servers to surveys to

00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:01,680
to match our 26 set

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,680
but we have something

00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:07,919
the uncertainty of

00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,360
the difference algorithms are going to

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,479
be used

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,199
and we have a completing

00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,599
training sets because we are dealing

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:22,000
with

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:25,680
um a very uh a very simple

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,680
data that there is a

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,680
there that that could be in incomplete

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,240
and you depend on the survey you are

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,240
working on

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:41,440
and here in my work i use two of

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:45,040
the most popular astronomical a

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:48,640
softwares for doing this i use

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:52,320
gpz and a n n z2

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:55,680
and the the first and

00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,160
is um approach that use

00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,839
gaussian processes to estimate your

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,640
photomath redshift

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,279
and we are focusing on the on the

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,519
variance

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,519
of the set because um

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:22,640
and we have to use a statistical

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:26,560
analysis because uh the uh

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:30,720
because the source of the of your

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:33,680
research is far far away we have to

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,240
we don't don't have a good precision

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,360
well

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:40,880
wait and the the the second

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:44,000
we i use is a nec2

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:47,440
that is the the updated version of the

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,560
original algorithm which use neural

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,600
networks

00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:55,920
and he and boosted

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,920
a decision and regression trees

00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,000
does it does anyone have a question

00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:10,800
hello hello hi i'm francesca

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:14,240
deske and i have just come

00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,519
so i was wondering if you could resume

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,920
briefly

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:23,120
the core of your work um

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:26,800
and i work with

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:30,320
reconstruction of a photometric

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:34,720
redshift do you know what is a redshift

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:38,399
um yes in general but

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:42,079
okay if you can explain something else

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:45,519
do you uh are you are you

00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,000
astronomer or something um no i work in

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,079
the field

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,680
of computational fluid dynamics so

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:53,920
totally another field

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:58,079
and i'm a beginner in python so

00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:02,079
very basic notion notions in astronomy

00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,800
oh i i will ex i will try to explain

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,720
what i do

00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,720
because uh i

00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,000
i'm still learning about it i am a

00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,519
mathematician and

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,720
i work i mean working in enough

00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:20,160
cosmology group and and i'm

00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:23,839
doing this in my master

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:26,720
tests and to understand

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,360
what a redshift is and you have to

00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,560
record

00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,920
what is the doppler effect and the

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:37,360
uh you know and when you are

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:40,880
we there there is a bus near

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:44,160
to you and

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:47,519
there is uh there is a change of pitch

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:50,000
pitch heard when when this bus

00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,560
sound your heart approached and received

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,680
from

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:57,120
you uh compared to the

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,519
empty frequency and the empty frequency

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,800
of

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,920
the way the wave is higher during the

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,040
approach

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,079
and where and it's lower during the

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,959
recession

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,560
redshift is the light version of this

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:15,519
phenomenon and we

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:20,560
experience it it all the time with sound

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:24,720
you have um you can see this

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:28,560
with this uh where

00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:33,200
we had here blue and we have here

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:36,240
red the frequency is is high

00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:40,639
of the light when we are here in

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:43,839
the blue and we

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:47,279
as we go and the frequency of

00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:51,040
the light is lower uh reaching red so

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:54,639
when you see uh i start

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:57,680
that is red it's blue us

00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:01,440
than water it's and

00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:04,720
more near uh it's more near than

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,360
that why why we

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,399
why we start this thing because we want

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,600
to know if

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:14,560
the universe is expanding of it

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,480
if it is contracting off if if it is

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,839
doing nothing

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:23,920
we have we have some evidence that a

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:27,920
is expanding and the measure of

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,920
redshift allows us to

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,639
measure this uh using a thing

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:38,399
called roboconstant

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:42,160
and this is one main reason we

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:43,440
start this this thing um there are two

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,440
main approaches

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:50,959
we use when we are measuring

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:54,079
redshift we can do a uh

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:57,199
and a data analysis uh that is why

00:13:54,079 --> 00:14:00,240
what i do because i don't know

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,519
enough physics to do a template fit

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,040
analysis

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:09,360
that they use uh um

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:14,880
healthy physics theory and

00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:17,040
i i in my research i use

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,480
machine learning techniques and the

00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,839
there are many there are many

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:25,279
uh machine learning software's that

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:28,959
that we can use and um

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:32,480
for uh for it but i i used

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:36,000
specifically two source i use a

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:39,600
gpz they use gaussian process

00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,880
and i use a and d2

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:47,120
the there is um and use

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:51,760
neural networks and boost decision trees

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,760
um um

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:59,839
but but to do our and but to do this

00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,839
we have to have our training set

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,480
because of this we we have the

00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,440
spectroscopy redshift

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,600
and our photo the redshift what is the

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,560
difference between the two

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,880
the difference is that photosynthetic

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,880
has

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:22,399
have has many um as

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:25,519
um just a

00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:28,399
five color six colors

00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,240
its colors that we actually see uh

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,680
accepted the infrared

00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:37,320
but spectroscopy right shift is all

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:40,399
the it's all the bands of the

00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,360
spectroscopy all the bands off the

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,480
spectrum

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:47,680
and it includes and includes

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:50,959
x-rays a gamma rays

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:55,120
and a variety of um

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:58,240
different bands the spectrum of

00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,920
the the atom

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:06,560
okay it's using atom analysis and

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:10,639
you it's used in stellar analysis

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,839
so um we have a lot of difficulties when

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:16,639
we are

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,639
doing this because we have um

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:23,120
a very uncertainty um source

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,560
we have frequently we have incomplete

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,000
training sets

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:31,360
we have uh the uncertainty in the

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:35,279
algorithm we use and we have

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:38,800
a a lot of uncertainty in our

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:41,839
inputs of training and because of this

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,759
we we do not use a package like

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,519
psychic learning things are full

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,639
directly we use

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:52,399
it we use there but i we use the

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:56,560
uh in some way we can get

00:16:52,399 --> 00:17:00,079
um or

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:04,079
it's variance because we have a we

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:07,439
we we work we

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:08,000
some uncertainty and of the redshift

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,439
because

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:15,600
we ca you cannot uh because uh because

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,720
uh we have this uh uncertain source and

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,000
we cannot uh

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:23,120
have the exactly result

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:26,959
this is why we have we work

00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:30,799
with uh specific softwares

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:34,720
which are described by um

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:38,480
academic papers uh in my work i use

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:41,679
this these two i uh

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:46,640
g-p-z and a-n-n's two

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:48,799
do you have uh some questions

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,919
yeah i have no experience about this

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,160
about these two softwares

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,960
but i was wondering because my work is

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,840
about

00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,840
reconstruction in medical imaging

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,679
and so do you do a sort of uh

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,799
reconstruction

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:11,200
uh process my name

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:14,640
no my my data is is is not

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:18,160
it's not image it's it's a uh it's

00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:21,679
um a number uh you we

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:24,960
it's the measure intensity of some

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:30,799
uh some color it's not

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,799
it's not the the image of the stars

00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:38,160
do you do you know ssd

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:42,000
uh we i work with

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:45,520
two servers they are available on

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,799
the internet and i cannot um find the

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:52,320
the chat but if you

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:55,919
if you if you search you can

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:59,280
you can find it then and it's

00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:02,720
10 stars with p

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:05,760
a n n stars

00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:10,160
and s d

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:12,240
s s

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,240
