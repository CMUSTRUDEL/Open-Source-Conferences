00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,119
my first my first euro python was back

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,439
in

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,560
in 2014 where as i recall i committed

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,840
the cardinal sin

00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,479
of running over a little bit into

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,560
lunchtime uh

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,799
and i remember alexander waving at me

00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,439
frantically trying to stop me but

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,320
to no avail uh and i promise you that i

00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,119
will not

00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,920
i will not run over into into the dinner

00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,240
time

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,680
which actually for me here in chicago

00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,200
will be lunchtime

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:48,799
uh this time so um

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,360
i have i've been a fan of euro python

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,560
since since my first one i've been a

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,280
member of the euro python society since

00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,719
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,040
and today as i i sort of look in the

00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,759
uh in the discourse channel and see lots

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,880
of

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,920
familiar names um i guess i'm

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,479
filled with feelings of well in

00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,040
portuguese they say saudaji's

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,520
this sort of feeling that you're missing

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,360
people

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,360
and good times and um i'm i'm delighted

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,360
to be here but i really

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,760
i really do as most of us wish we could

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,760
be uh in person

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:30,879
um but yeah to to continue here

00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,480
um i have to admit uh i'm gonna do some

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:36,160
things that probably

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:39,200
will give the presenters nightmares so

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,440
um what i'm going to do is actually i'm

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,519
not going to use any slides

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,959
uh there are slides and and they do

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,080
reflect what i'll be

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,000
speaking uh be saying but you don't i'm

00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,840
not going to be showing them to you

00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
instead i'm going to abuse the

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,879
background feature let's see how this

00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,640
works

00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:01,519
uh and um i can blame all of this on

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,239
euro python because it was at that 2014

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,480
euro python the first one i was at that

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,560
peter hinchens gave a really great

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,239
keynote without using slides and that's

00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,920
kind of been behind

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:17,760
my temptation over the past few years to

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,720
not use slides i also it is true have

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,040
been known to say

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,480
that bullet point slides will suck the

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,280
intelligence right out through your

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,799
eyeballs

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,480
please don't take offense if you're

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:31,120
using bullet point slides

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:33,840
i just say things okay so um

00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,280
yeah uh it's that's that's sort of

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,319
what's going on

00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:42,560
um as as mentioned

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:45,440
uh i up up until um a few weeks ago

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,159
uh was the uh chair of the board of

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,680
directors

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:53,599
of of the python software foundation uh

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,439
and um i

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,360
stepped aside this year and that had

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,319
been something that honestly i had been

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,680
planning

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,439
uh for really for a couple of years that

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,959
i was going to do that

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:10,000
um i felt that um

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:13,439
five years as as vice chair and then

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,280
chair of of the board was plenty

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:20,239
uh and um i had

00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,000
i wanted to to give other people a a

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:23,680
chance and i'd hope that maybe this

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,240
would be an opportunity

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,040
to increase uh the diversity on the

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,320
board

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,720
um i i certainly admire all the people

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,720
that

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,960
that were elected but i think like a lot

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,600
of people the diversity part i was

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:41,199
hoping for hasn't quite happened yet

00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,000
i know that the uh the psf will be

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,280
working

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,320
to improve that and i hope everybody

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,360
will join me in

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,400
in supporting the board and the staff as

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,400
they work through

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,840
things that we might do in order to make

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,120
sure that we have

00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,880
uh a truly global board to go with a

00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,600
a truly uh global community so as i say

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,800
my my stepping aside was was part of my

00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,199
plan

00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:13,520
um i had a lot of other plans though

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:16,160
um i i had plans to go to pike on u.s

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,759
um as i was you know back in january

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,560
thinking about how the year would shape

00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,919
up

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,680
i was going to go to pike on u.s

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:25,039
i was going to watch some of those

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,880
things that you know they

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,639
kindly read the list for me so i guess i

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,039
don't have to of things that i

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,919
kind of worked on to get started at

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,479
pycon

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,680
and i was going to enjoy that i had even

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:37,919
done

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,600
a painting that i was going to donate to

00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,800
the pie ladies auction i

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:48,479
you can see it behind me i painted yes

00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:50,000
painted 45 uh different pie ladies logos

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,600
as something that i was going to give

00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,479
away and

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,240
you know i had i had various other plans

00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,880
for the year beyond that

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,440
um you know when euro python was going

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,440
to be

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,080
in dublin that was pretty tempting it's

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,560
easy to get to dublin from chicago

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,360
um there was pycon latam in puerto

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,479
vallarta

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:14,560
i i had actually bought a ticket to

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:17,759
uh go to spain for pycon espana again

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:21,039
uh and so i had all of those things

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:25,199
kind of um uh lined up

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:26,240
uh and then to me as to everybody else

00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,280
in the world

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,319
2020 happened uh and

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,800
uh covid19 and and

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,600
all of the things that that went with

00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,520
that

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:42,639
um and particularly being on the board

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:46,319
um there was uh the

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:49,440
the agonizing process of

00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,720
canceling pycon uh this was something

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,680
that developed uh

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,759
in january it didn't seem like there was

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,759
really going to be a problem it was just

00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,240
this thing that was far away

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,759
in february it started to seem like it

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,240
was going to be a problem but i was

00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,199
hoping

00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,639
maybe we could have at least a small

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,720
picon before

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,800
it hit the us and was a serious issue

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,240
by about the beginning of march i was

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,479
starting to do the math

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,240
you know if we've got a population of so

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,080
many people we've got a conference of 3

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,120
500 people and we have this infection

00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,960
rate what are the odds we're going to

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,000
have people with the virus at that

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,800
and that was when i realized that it was

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,880
pretty certain we weren't going to have

00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:36,000
a a pike on us at that point

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,319
and um a bunch of us uh

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,520
the on the board of directors we were in

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,400
the psf

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,280
uh board slack channel pretty much 12

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,120
hours a day

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,120
every day trying to figure out what was

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,440
going on following the news comparing

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,479
notes tracking things

00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,280
and i know a lot of people at the time

00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,319
we saw the tweets we we heard the

00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,000
comments

00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,160
a lot of people at the time were asking

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,599
well why doesn't the psf

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:07,520
just cancel pycon now

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,879
uh and um as as has come out and i

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,639
you know you will hear other people

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,160
talking about this as well the reason we

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,440
couldn't do that

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:18,560
is because with the contracts we had for

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:22,160
the venue and for food and for hotels

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,039
um we would have lost the psf would have

00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,960
lost and

00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,879
more than a half a million dollars if we

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,759
would have just unilaterally

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,919
pulled out when we saw things starting

00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:35,919
to get bad we had to wait

00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:39,599
for the local governments to

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,120
actually shut us down officially

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,959
so that we could get out of those

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,839
contracts and

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,600
that wasn't happening i know i for one

00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,399
was watching the pittsburgh area they've

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,920
got cases

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,920
why aren't they canceling can't they see

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,160
and eventually that did happen and then

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,600
we we went to all of our suppliers and

00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,920
we managed to

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,839
get out of most of those contracts uh

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,040
without without much of a loss

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,760
and of course um people were were very

00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,040
generous

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:11,120
in not claiming uh their registration

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,880
many of our sponsors were very generous

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,160
in not claiming a refund for their

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,160
sponsorship

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,720
uh so you know that enabled us to do um

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,279
all of the things that we could do so it

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,920
was

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,399
um it was probably one of the longer

00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,760
months of my life to tell you the truth

00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:32,320
uh as we kind of came to to this

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,360
uh conclusion that that's what was

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,399
happening

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:40,000
and of course um it didn't really

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:43,680
end with that um after

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:46,640
after that happened um

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,839
the outbreaks continued to get worse um

00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,720
places all around the world went into

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,640
lockdown um

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,240
i know here in chicago we went into

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,920
lockdown officially

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,040
and in late march uh knowing what was

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,760
coming i kind of did

00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,360
unofficially about a week earlier uh but

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,720
you know all of that happened

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:10,079
um travel was shut down everywhere

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,920
um and then you know just as things were

00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:15,360
starting to look like we were

00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:19,279
improving um a

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:22,560
a a cop in minneapolis

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:25,440
in minneapolis um murdered george floyd

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,560
and that set off um a wave of of

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,640
protests

00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,760
um both in the united states and around

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,320
the world

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,320
and you know lord knows those those

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,839
protests were justified

00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:41,200
as long overdue to uh

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,600
to address systemic racism but

00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,720
it was a case where there was yet more

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,880
turmoil

00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,839
and and it just sort of didn't seem to

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,880
want to stop

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,040
for a while um i think

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,000
you know now we're in a better place

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,200
after all we're

00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,720
we're at uh at least a an online

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,959
version of euro python um and that

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,760
i think basically made me start thinking

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:07,440
back to

00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:10,320
to some of the other euro pythons uh and

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,200
you know i i think back to bilbao

00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,399
because i think

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,680
bilbao was one of my favorite spots for

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,959
europa python

00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,959
uh i i loved uh the water and the

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,440
guggenheim and there was the park

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,320
it was a nice venue and i liked the city

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,839
uh just

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,959
just in general um you know i a lot of a

00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,800
lot of really

00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:36,800
um good memories uh about uh my time

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,920
uh that i spent on both 2015 and 2016

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,240
there

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:46,240
um and um

00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:49,200
i also then have to remember that uh

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,839
i gave a keynote at euro python in

00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,360
bilbao in 2016.

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:59,600
uh and um it was

00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,560
um as as i often do it was about

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,560
community

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:07,600
uh as as i often as i often do

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,079
uh i quoted uh brett cannon

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,440
uh his line about i don't know about the

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,600
rest of you

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,040
i came for the language but i stayed for

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,200
the community

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:21,519
uh and um as you might be able to see in

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,560
the slide that's behind me a little bit

00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:28,560
i talked then i was worried a little bit

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:30,000
about um python community i was worried

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,680
that there were

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,040
forces of division that there were

00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,360
forces that were going to make

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,399
communities have a harder time to stick

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,040
together

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,920
we had just been uh just had the brexit

00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,279
vote

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:46,320
um right-wing populism

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,320
was was

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,360
starting to gain a foothold it seemed in

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,600
many places

00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,120
in the u.s in europe and and in other

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,800
places as well

00:12:53,120 --> 00:13:00,639
and so i was i was a little bit

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:05,040
a little bit worried about uh community

00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:08,399
and as i think of myself back in 2016

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,720
from the vantage point of 2020 all i can

00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,560
do is just sort of shake my head and say

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,240
naomi naomi

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:19,519
you sweet innocent summer

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:22,800
child you don't know the half

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,480
of what is coming um because you know

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,720
indeed if if things were

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,160
maybe a little bit concerning now i

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,279
would say that

00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:34,399
um we're in a situation that really puts

00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:38,000
the the notion of community

00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:39,920
uh under siege and um

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
i think there are a lot of forces that

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,079
are very seriously going to

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,120
to make building community more of a

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,399
challenge

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,199
or to put it this way i think i'm not

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,279
alone

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:54,480
in saying i would go back to the summer

00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:57,519
of 2016 in a heartbeat

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,440
if i had that choice um

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,680
we've got a lot of things that that we

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:05,120
need to worry about

00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:07,279
in some places um you know the virus

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,199
situation seems to be under control but

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,959
we still have no idea whether or not

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,920
there's going to be a second or third

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,360
wave

00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,800
particularly as as the weather changes

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,160
winter comes in in the northern

00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:22,480
hemisphere and things like that

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,040
and while some places have done a pretty

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,920
good job of managing things i think

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,760
certainly on a national level the u.s

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,880
has given a master's class

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:36,560
in what not to do to manage

00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:39,199
a a pandemic and sadly

00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:41,600
we're not alone we have company in doing

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:45,120
things almost exactly the wrong

00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:48,399
the wrong way uh all of which means that

00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:51,519
you know on sort of a global scale um

00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,079
the the pandemic doesn't really seem to

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,320
be

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,000
that much more under control certainly

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,199
not as much as we would think it should

00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,560
be

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:04,320
uh and i think going along with this

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:07,440
um we will continue to have fatalities

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,839
and i think the thing i dread most about

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,000
that

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,000
i haven't heard of any really in the

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,639
python community

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,880
yet there must have been some i haven't

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,639
heard of many deaths of of people active

00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,760
in the python community

00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:24,079
but i really dread uh if

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,680
the situation continues to worsen if we

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,000
don't get this under control that we

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,760
might

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,360
start losing people from our python

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:33,120
community i

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:36,800
i really don't want that to happen

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,639
and you know sadly

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,360
that's only part of it because of course

00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,480
we also have the economic fallout coming

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,519
from this

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,000
and i think that we are just starting to

00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,040
really see the long-term consequences of

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,560
this

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:55,519
um you know being

00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,000
python programmers python developers

00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:00,240
we've been sort of spoiled over

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,519
probably the last 10 years at least in

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,279
that our skills have been

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:09,680
increasingly in demand we can find

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:11,759
employment um it's pretty easy to find a

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,920
job trade up to a better job i mean if

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:17,199
you have any experience at all this

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:21,279
this starts to be relatively speaking

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:23,839
uh has been a good job market uh and

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,199
i think we're going to see that change

00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,000
and we're going to see that change

00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,519
because

00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,839
companies are cutting back on their

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,959
budgets

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,800
in a lot of ways i think startups

00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,000
particularly if they're not taking in

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,680
revenue yet are going

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,240
to be in a hard place to find funding

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,320
all of this will mean that there will be

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,120
probably fewer people hired there will

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,800
be

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,880
more demand it will become a buyer's

00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,480
market rather than a seller's market as

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,560
far as our employment skills are

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,519
concerned

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:58,079
and i think going along with that we're

00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:01,120
going to see

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:03,680
sponsors for community events support

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,280
for things that we do in the community

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:09,600
also be kind of pulled back some

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,600
i think with the fact that uh all

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,679
conferences in person have

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,679
pretty much been shut down now for a few

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,880
months i think there's a certain number

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,280
of big sponsors or

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,199
even starting to rethink the notion of

00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:24,799
whether or not

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,880
they they will be spending as much money

00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:30,000
to sponsor in-person events

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:33,120
when they do return so

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,480
you know that's all sad to say uh pretty

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,799
sobering

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:42,240
um i think in a more general way

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:45,840
we're also facing um

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,120
a continued growth of polarization and

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,720
conflict

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:54,160
um and while protests

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,360
and and and the drive for uh improved

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,919
justice to

00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,320
to get rid of systemic racism and all of

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,960
the other things

00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,000
is it's way past time that this should

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,600
be done

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,799
um but i am afraid that we will have

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:13,360
um repressive governments

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,400
uh regimes that will try to use that

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,520
sort of

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:21,280
protest as an excuse

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:25,200
for for repression to remove the rights

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:28,480
of all sorts of minorities racial

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,320
religious lgbtq

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,320
i think we're seeing that in places

00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,520
already where where there is an attempt

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,080
to pull back

00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:37,840
uh rights and restrict rights and some

00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,280
of this will be done in the name of the

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,600
current crisis

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,360
and i think that will be a huge

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,520
challenge for us

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,520
as a community going forward

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,640
that said

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:56,799
i have before confessed to being quite

00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,919
old

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,120
um it's true i've been around longer

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,160
than many of you

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,720
uh and i have seen some various things

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,799
that

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,080
are um have been kind of challenging i

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:15,120
do recall

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:18,160
the 60s and the 70s when again we had

00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,720
lots of protests we had some economic

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,600
issues

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,600
things like that

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:28,080
but i think i would also say

00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,880
that i have not seen something on the

00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,880
level

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,240
that we are seeing now and that we will

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,120
be seeing

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,720
um in fact the the closest thing i can

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:41,520
think of more

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:45,840
is the uh 1930s and 1940s when we had

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:49,120
um a depression and um

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,919
world war ii following upon that and uh

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,640
that was the arrow when my parents came

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:58,080
of age and i know that that

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,679
that period shaped them in ways that i

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,640
really couldn't understand

00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,960
coming several years later i think that

00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,000
the

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:09,919
impact of what we are seeing today will

00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,919
similarly last a generation

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:17,280
so what

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,760
are we looking at as we move forward

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,760
well

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,440
you know it's not that i really know but

00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,240
having watched things there are

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:28,159
certainly some possibilities

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:32,240
we will be moving are moving

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,240
as they say into the new normal

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,360
one thing i can say is that i don't

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,679
think the new normal is going to be much

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:43,520
like the old normal at least not for

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:46,400
uh for quite a while i think

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:48,080
we will continue to see uh greatly

00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,280
reduced travel

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:53,360
um as all of the

00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,480
you know the airlines and everything is

00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,720
cut back has gone

00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,840
ground down to just a tiny fraction of

00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,559
what it was

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,480
i do not think that those things will

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,159
will come back right away

00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,000
i don't think that there will be the

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,039
market for those things to come back

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,400
right away

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:13,520
uh so i would expect

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,799
that uh travel will be

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,039
less frequent more trouble and

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,559
more expensive certainly in the next

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,360
couple of years

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:25,760
and you know who knows as we start to

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:29,679
consider the environmental cost

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:33,039
on the climate change costs of travel um

00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:36,159
i'm not sure that it will ever come back

00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,559
uh i think conferences when they do come

00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,760
back

00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:41,679
in person are going to be smaller

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,280
they're probably going to be mixed

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,880
events where a large part of it is

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,120
online

00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,400
i think this will be a very different

00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:53,840
thing than what we have had in the past

00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:57,520
as i say in general i think we will have

00:21:53,840 --> 00:22:00,480
fewer resources for community

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,000
events for starting companies i think

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,559
everything is going to be

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,950
a bit more expensive uh i just have a

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,159
hard time seeing how we're not going to

00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:10,240
[Music]

00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,520
over the next few years have those sorts

00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,799
of impacts

00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,679
along with as i mentioned before a a

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,880
tougher

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:22,720
a tougher job market as well

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:25,919
so that's all pretty gloomy

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,480
uh i admit it uh you may be wondering so

00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,919
is there

00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:32,000
anything good going on um

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,080
and uh i just sort of saw earlier in the

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,080
lightning talks we have more translation

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,720
of the documentation into portuguese

00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,200
that's good

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,000
into spanish that's good uh but i think

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,039
there is in

00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
fact uh some other good news as well

00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,760
uh i think the good news basically is

00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,640
that we're adapting

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,320
uh and that we can adapt and i think

00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,000
there are a lot of things going on with

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,200
this for one thing

00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:01,440
um meetups have

00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:04,480
moved online and seem to be flourishing

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:08,640
um the the picture behind me

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:11,120
is from uh pie ladies guatemala and um

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,280
i i seem to be invited to at least a

00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,919
couple of meetups a month these days

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,520
they seem to be uh popping up all over

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,760
or ones that were there before

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,200
don't you know seem to be having maybe

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,640
even more events

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,960
uh and i think this is actually kind of

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,600
a

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,039
a an interesting and and encouraging

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,280
thing to watch

00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,880
because when everybody's meetup is

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,880
online

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,080
the organizers are free to get speakers

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,559
from wherever they're not

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,919
just limited to the people around them

00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,320
and on the flip side

00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,840
uh when everybody's online if you get

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,080
asked to speak someplace it doesn't

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:49,360
matter whether it's in guatemala

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:52,240
or amsterdam or next door uh

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,559
you can go ahead and and and speak at

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,880
that so i've seen a lot of

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:59,039
uh international exchange a lot of

00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,200
communities getting to know each other

00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,480
uh i know there are even a few meetups

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,880
that i've seen where

00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,720
uh two similar groups in completely

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,120
different cities completely different

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,080
continents uh will have a meet-up

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,279
together

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:17,200
and i i find all of that really

00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:18,880
really cool i i just i love to see that

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,640
going on

00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:26,159
um i think that we're adapting also

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,720
when it comes to to conferences uh

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,080
i think that conferences are are

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,360
experimenting i think

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:36,159
that this conference euro python

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,840
is the grandest experiment in making a

00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,200
conference go online

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:43,039
uh that i've seen so far euro python

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,960
always had many parts and was well

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:48,039
organized and all of that but

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,080
um the event the the effort and the

00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:53,440
experimentation to put on

00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:56,559
this conference has been uh to my mind

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,720
truly stunning um

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,400
i mean for one thing i mean i checked

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:04,080
their speaker's guide

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:06,000
the speaker's guide is 38 pages long

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,400
they have thought of everything they've

00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:13,039
tried everything to try to get

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:15,840
uh as much of a a conference experience

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:17,919
uh in uh online formats i mean we're

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,200
using two formats we're using zoom and

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,320
we're using discourse

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,960
all of these things so i think that uh

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,159
as we continue to experiment with these

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:30,159
things we're going to see

00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:31,039
all sorts of uh interesting things

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,400
happening

00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:36,159
uh with conferences and uh i'm i'm proud

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,880
that euro python has been

00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,000
uh such a leader in in thinking these

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,000
things through

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,720
uh and experimenting with all of that um

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,679
we're also doing a lot to share

00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,240
knowledge

00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,320
uh here this is a shout out to chuck i

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,480
stole a screenshot of chuck's uh

00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,440
twitch channel because she's got so much

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,640
stuff

00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,640
but everyone is doing it um there are

00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:03,600
all sorts of free training courses

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:07,120
springing up online training videos

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:09,120
um people are doing uh twitch streams we

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,400
have twitch talking about python we have

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,919
twitch streams where people are

00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,440
demonstrating python

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:18,320
um and i i did several episodes myself

00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:20,240
of one i called exploring python that i

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,120
i may come back to

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,559
when i get time um there have been all

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,480
sorts of groups that have been putting

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:30,400
on online workshops

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,799
so there has really been as far as i can

00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,120
tell

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:37,440
an explosion of people sharing content

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,440
of people trying to get the word out and

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:43,600
and help each other

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:46,559
through their knowledge which um

00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,600
is again it's stunning you know when you

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,360
think about

00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,720
the number of things that you can find

00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:56,400
that people are doing these days

00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:58,960
um we're also contributing

00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,760
and and trying to make the situation

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,640
better

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,080
uh through what we all do best which is

00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,039
code

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,880
and that maybe people contributing uh

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:12,400
data analysis

00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,480
um it may be people actually setting up

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,520
sites to share the data

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:21,520
uh i know there are several cases where

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:25,360
uh the uh the actual

00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:27,760
um data involved in say the virus

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,520
situation would not be getting out if it

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,919
were not for the efforts

00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,399
uh of people people in the python

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:37,279
community in fact uh

00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:39,760
and we're also even finding ways that we

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,640
can use our skills to help support other

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:43,360
people

00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,880
uh the the image behind me is from

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,760
myudapai

00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:50,720
which is was created by a member of the

00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:54,480
python community in paraguay

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,600
and it's meant to be a an easy place for

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,320
people who need

00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,840
help to put up a request and for people

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,799
who want to help to find

00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,320
people near them that they can help and

00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:06,399
and these are requests they're all very

00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,799
basic things they need diapers they need

00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:10,720
food uh they want books for their

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:11,520
shut-in elderly mother who can't get out

00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,480
because of the

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,880
of the quarantine or various things like

00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,760
that and this was all sort of just done

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,600
um by as i say a member of the python

00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,720
community who wanted to

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,880
who wanted to help out so there

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,760
there are so many of the things like

00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:32,159
that

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:34,080
and you know as it's also the case that

00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,159
while the employment market is getting

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,039
tighter the fact that work has moved

00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,720
online

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:45,039
i think is um holds some

00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:47,279
potential for a lot of people um

00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:48,320
it's it's probably no surprise but it

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,760
did take a

00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,279
a pandemic for a business in general to

00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,600
realize that most of us

00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,919
in our business can do our jobs from

00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,559
almost anywhere

00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:02,480
but this this willingness to distribute

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:05,840
and accept remote workers

00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:08,320
uh makes life easier for a lot of people

00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,039
uh i think increasingly we will not have

00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,559
to move

00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,440
to uh an expensive hot spot city in

00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,880
order to

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:19,440
uh get a a tech job but instead

00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:22,159
uh we'll be able to work from where we

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:25,520
have family or just where we want to be

00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,000
or or whatever it might be so that i

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,480
think

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,520
is is an interesting and a positive

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,799
thing

00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,760
that that is coming out of uh all of

00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:38,240
this

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,240
um so um

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:44,320
i guess that kind of brings me to

00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,080
the last part of what i want to say and

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,080
that is you know

00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,640
what does that mean what what where are

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:53,760
we now what can we do

00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,440
as our global community of python

00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,640
programmers

00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:00,960
and uh i have

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:03,440
at least my suggestions i'm sure that

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,720
there are many more

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,000
but uh one thing that i i think we are

00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,360
doing and that we can do

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,320
more is we can start to really use

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,600
the technology that we've got it's it's

00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:19,200
sort of interesting we've

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:22,559
had uh video conferencing now

00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:25,600
for for years uh

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:27,520
and until this came along and we really

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,600
didn't have much choice we i don't we

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,200
didn't come anywhere near using it

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,279
effectively

00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,399
i think as we're pushed now we can

00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,960
really

00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:39,520
explore these tools we can really test

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,880
them we can drive their improvement

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,480
uh and i think uh as a community we're

00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,399
kind of positioned to

00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,320
to be at the front of that in making

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:51,520
these tools really

00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:53,440
useful for everyone in a lot of ways in

00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:55,279
developing the ways that they haven't

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:58,640
been

00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:01,679
um we can also uh

00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,480
continue to take care of each other i

00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,600
think this is

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:08,880
really important i think we can

00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:12,720
continue to draw upon our communities to

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:13,679
fight isolation to to be there for each

00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,960
other

00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:19,279
i know this has happened to me a lot

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,240
over the course of the past few months

00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,320
um

00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,919
people will reach out or i'll reach out

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,840
hey how you doing i haven't heard from

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,080
you a while are you okay

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,360
uh and i think that helps everybody when

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,880
you do that

00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,960
certainly makes your day better to have

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,200
somebody check in and say hey

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,080
are you okay yes great oh well i'm fine

00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,600
too

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:42,240
so i think we need to make an effort

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,640
to do that uh we need to make an effort

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,640
to

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,720
to nurture all of those friendships that

00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,360
we've made in the various times that

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,120
we've been able to go to conferences

00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,440
and we need to make an effort to use

00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:56,320
these new tools to

00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,120
continue to find and develop friendships

00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,279
there maybe

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:01,039
someday we will be able to meet them in

00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:04,159
person at a conference

00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:06,320
uh if things get back to that point so

00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:10,320
we need to do that

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:14,320
um i think we also um

00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:18,399
need to um be optimistic

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,360
and um what i'm thinking of here in

00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,600
particular

00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,120
uh chomsky wrote something to the effect

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:27,120
that optimism

00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:29,360
is a strategy for making a better future

00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,600
because unless you believe that the

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,039
future can be better

00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:37,200
uh you are unlikely to step up and take

00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:40,559
responsibility for making it so

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,720
so i think we've all had our

00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,159
our days in the past few months maybe of

00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,279
doom scrolling and

00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:50,000
and being unable to shake it off um

00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:52,080
i think as much as we can we need to try

00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,679
to choose to do things that reflect

00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,720
optimism um i think i've found over the

00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,919
years that

00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:02,720
uh sometimes acting doing things as

00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,720
if you were optimistic uh can actually

00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,120
help you be a bit more optimistic but i

00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:11,360
think we need to keep in mind that

00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:13,760
um as as tough as things have been

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,640
and and and may continue to be for a

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,240
while

00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:19,600
that we can we can uh be optimistic and

00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,159
we can expect

00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,000
things to get better and we can act in

00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,000
ways that will make things better i

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,519
think it's important for us to keep that

00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,080
in mind

00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:32,080
in particular i think we can

00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:38,559
continue to work on building community

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,200
on making our communities more inclusive

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:44,480
making our communities more just

00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,960
uh we can continue to push for that

00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,559
we can continue to organize volunteer

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,559
and contribute to the community

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,279
some people may say ah this is a crisis

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,480
we can't worry about building inclusive

00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,840
communities now

00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,240
i think that's exactly wrong i think

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,399
that because this is a crisis

00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,440
one of the important ways we will get

00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,840
out of it

00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,919
is through communities and building

00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,399
inclusive and just and welcoming

00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:13,359
communities is probably one of the best

00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,520
things

00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:17,679
we can be doing in the face of this

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,879
crisis

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:23,340
um we can

00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,960
continue as i mentioned to

00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:27,520
[Music]

00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,520
use our skills with code to help improve

00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:32,800
the situation

00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:37,359
we can share

00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:40,399
data we can continue to educate people

00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:42,960
think of the impact having hundreds or

00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:45,040
thousands more people educated and data

00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,760
analysis would have

00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,639
particularly on some some people in

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,359
government who want to promote

00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:54,560
misinformation

00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:58,240
um as i say we can share data behind me

00:34:54,560 --> 00:35:00,800
is uh from brazil io where with um

00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,079
a vault with a bunch of volunteers they

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,400
are able to get out

00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,160
a more complete picture of the virus

00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,880
situation in brazil

00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,520
than i think the the federal government

00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,359
of brazil

00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,839
itself can uh so we can continue to do

00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,400
that we can continue to create services

00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:19,520
that

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:23,839
help people find the resources they need

00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:26,960
help people connect with others we can

00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:29,440
help develop means of communication and

00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:30,000
and sharing information all of those

00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,200
things are

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,400
things that we in the python community

00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:40,000
uh are particularly able

00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:42,160
to help achieve and i i think that we

00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,079
need to do those things

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:49,440
um and then um

00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:53,119
finally uh i think we can

00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:55,170
uh we can lead and

00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,720
uh by that i mean um

00:35:55,170 --> 00:36:01,440
[Music]

00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:05,119
we tend to have in the python community

00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:08,240
the backgrounds that we can be informed

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:11,760
citizens and we can speak out uh

00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:14,880
i think that with our experiences

00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,560
in developing community as part of the

00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,079
python community

00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:22,240
um we are particularly able to advocate

00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:23,680
for things that are good for communities

00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,760
in general

00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,440
i think we have an appreciation of

00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,560
building community

00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:34,960
that is useful in a in a wider

00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:38,400
uh in a wider sense not to mention that

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:41,280
the experience we have in organizing our

00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:44,560
python communities

00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:47,119
is is directly applicable to organizing

00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:50,880
other communities if you can organize

00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:54,480
uh a a python meetup you can organize a

00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,960
meetup of other people to work on uh

00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,079
other issues that are are are in your

00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,280
community

00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:03,520
uh if you can um bring together and

00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,000
organize a pie ladies chapter then you

00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,839
know about building up groups of people

00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,920
and and how to get people together

00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:13,599
communicate get the word out

00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:17,200
uh all of those things so i think we

00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:21,359
as the python community uh

00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:25,440
are particularly well positioned

00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:27,040
uh to to lead to to be at the forefront

00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,000
as we work through

00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,720
uh the changes that that we are going to

00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,520
experience

00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,960
as we go through this uh i think that

00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,520
that can't really

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,079
uh be emphasized enough and i think that

00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:42,640
it is

00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:46,079
it is our responsibility uh to do that

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:48,880
um and you know i think

00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,440
um i i promised you i wouldn't i

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,240
wouldn't

00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,760
come close to getting into the dinner

00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,079
time and i'm going to keep my word on

00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,440
that

00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,240
but um i just want to to say that you

00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,280
know we are

00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:04,480
we are facing times i think that will

00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:08,560
really reshape the world and i think

00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:10,960
that the python community

00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:12,720
with its understanding of the importance

00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,079
of community how to build it how to

00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,000
bring people together how to be

00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:20,000
inclusive how to be just

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,680
uh we are going to be very important

00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,280
in how that gets shaped and it's our

00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:27,119
responsibility

00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:30,000
to step up and and do help shape it

00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,320
now you know i i don't know how how

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,280
profound or insightful any of this has

00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,359
been

00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,920
um i think sometimes it's important to

00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:41,920
just have

00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,920
someone say things and

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,040
i hope that that's what i have done here

00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,839
is just say

00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,720
out loud some things that need to be

00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:51,760
said

00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:54,720
um and i guess you know

00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,880
on on that note let let me let me close

00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,320
here by saying one last thing that

00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:03,680
in my mind needs to be said and that is

00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:06,800
everyone everyone take care of

00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:10,640
yourselves and those close to you

00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,520
be safe and wear the damn masks i don't

00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,640
want to lose

00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:18,560
a single one of you so

00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,560
thank you everyone that's what i've got

00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:23,760
[Applause]

00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,839
thank you so much for that mail me some

00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,800
some very poignant

00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:30,160
excellent thoughts for for our our era

00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,000
um i have a couple of uh

00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,280
questions here in q a would you be

00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,480
willing to answer those

00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,880
uh sure i'll give it a shot all right so

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,079
um

00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,920
oliver asks um he said uh there are

00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,760
forces dividing you said that there are

00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,720
forces dividing or endangering the

00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,640
community can you

00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:50,560
provide more details on that please um

00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:51,680
i think we are entering an age where we

00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,720
are going to have

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:59,440
a um a rise

00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:01,599
in xenophobia and things like that

00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,079
and i think we have had horizons

00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,520
xenophobia i think that directly works

00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:09,599
against

00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:11,520
our efforts to build a global community

00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,119
if in fact you want to have someone from

00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,920
another country come and visit your

00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,160
conference

00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,440
when we get back to that point where we

00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,079
uh

00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,790
having having a government that is

00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,960
increasingly hostile to

00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:26,160
[Music]

00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:28,800
foreigners entering uh becomes a real

00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,319
a real drag on trying to bring people

00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,160
together

00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,680
so i think you know that's kind of an

00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:37,359
example

00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,000
i think that even the divisions of

00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,800
opinion that

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,720
people will have politically uh will be

00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,359
a force that will tend to drive people

00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,960
apart

00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:48,800
uh within communities uh not everyone

00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,040
in the python community is going to

00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,200
agree on on everything

00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,119
and we're entering an age now where i

00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,040
think um

00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,880
there's a lot more polarization a lot

00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:02,000
less willingness to compromise

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,839
and and get along um

00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,000
i would say there are certain things

00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:08,800
upon which you cannot compromise

00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,359
but the problem is when we enter such a

00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:13,599
a stage of polarization

00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:14,960
it becomes impossible to win everyone

00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,880
anyone over we

00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,240
we simply enter kind of a fight to the

00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,599
death stage

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:24,160
so that makes it hard to coalesce a

00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,160
community

00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,760
uh so on the on that same note i've got

00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,280
a another question

00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:34,160
here kind of uh kind of on this idea of

00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,800
you mentioned coalescing a community um

00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,040
uh

00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,720
trevin said while many organizations

00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,720
including euro python have been able to

00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,240
shift to virtual venues do you feel this

00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,560
will make it harder to form

00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,480
strong and diverse communities as those

00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,319
who do not have internet access will not

00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:50,160
be able to participate and how should we

00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:53,359
reach out to them

00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:56,720
um i think

00:41:53,359 --> 00:42:00,000
in some areas that that will be

00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:03,200
a bit of a problem i think

00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,319
that uh over the past few years we

00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:09,359
have done uh that access

00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:10,800
to to decent internet bandwidth that

00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,160
would allow you to take part in

00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:15,920
something like this

00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:18,000
has increased but it's by no means

00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,920
universal there are lots of places where

00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,520
this is a problem

00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,880
um i think that will be a challenge for

00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,839
us i don't have

00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,800
honestly some great answers i know that

00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,640
um

00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,520
bandwidth has been for a lot of

00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:38,240
communities a a perennial problem

00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,240
and it may be that um

00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,319
some things like this will have to to be

00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,760
rethought

00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:46,720
um i don't know if there's um if anybody

00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:50,160
has tried having an

00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:52,319
audio only channel or not um

00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,560
one of my one of my developers is in

00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:56,480
lagos nigeria and i know we sometimes

00:42:54,560 --> 00:43:00,240
have to kill videos so that we have

00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:03,200
we can actually talk uh and

00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,800
yeah i'm with with the interaction you

00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:07,680
need to build a community that is going

00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,680
to be a challenge

00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,079
and then kind of along those same lines

00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:14,079
thomas is from a limited experience with

00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,040
the linux user group a mixed event some

00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,839
people on site

00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:19,920
some online uh does not work that great

00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:20,319
for example audio is a problem people on

00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,240
site

00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:24,079
don't share with the online people do

00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,319
you have a specific idea on how we can

00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:29,440
do that better um

00:43:26,319 --> 00:43:32,560
specific ideas no i think that

00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,640
the general thing is that we need to be

00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:38,160
aware of those issues and actually

00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:39,680
try to fix them and i say that having

00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,480
had

00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,599
mixed remote teams as well uh that just

00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,160
in in

00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,760
that i've managed it's really a

00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,599
challenge when you have

00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,520
half of your people in the office and

00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,400
half of the people scattered out remote

00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,400
because

00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,240
there's always this temptation to turn

00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,760
around and say to the person behind you

00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,760
oh did you do this thing

00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,200
and the remote people have no idea what

00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:04,079
that that's happened

00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:05,520
so for conferences we have the same

00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:07,839
challenge

00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,680
i think people have made progress in

00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:10,800
just trying to delineate what the best

00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,800
practices are

00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:14,400
and how to get around that so that it

00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,720
can be improved

00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,200
uh i also don't know that that

00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:22,480
differential will ever go away

00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:24,560
uh but there again that's something that

00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,640
as we move into this era and actually

00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:29,359
try to solve the problem we may come up

00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,880
with better solutions than we've got now

00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:34,240
but i think awareness and actually

00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:36,400
addressing it is the first step

00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,480
awesome yeah and uh i know we only have

00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,040
a few a few seconds left but i feel like

00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,040
this

00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,880
last one's important uh nicholas said

00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,800
how can we integrate the psf more with

00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:45,440
python communities that are not in the

00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,960
europe or

00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:51,040
us um

00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,119
i think one of the things that that

00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:55,440
needs to be done is what i alluded to at

00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:58,720
the top of my speech which is that

00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:01,280
uh we need to find ways to get uh

00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,319
people from those communities uh

00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:06,000
involved

00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:09,520
uh at a leadership level of the psf

00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,160
and i am no longer on the board so this

00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,480
both gives

00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,280
this kind of gives me the luxury of of

00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,960
shrugging and

00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:18,160
and sort of ducking the whole thing in

00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,839
that i cannot speak for the board uh i

00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,200
know that they are passionate about

00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:24,000
addressing this

00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:25,440
uh and i also know from my experience

00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,240
because i've been around and i've met

00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,720
them all

00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:30,560
that there are so many qualified people

00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:34,160
in all of these other countries

00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:36,800
uh other continents uh beyond um

00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,000
you know right now the board is is kind

00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:41,359
of strong on

00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,599
on us northern europe

00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:45,280
australia there are lots of places where

00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:46,000
we have plenty of gifted people who

00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,359
would be great

00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,200
to to have leadership um but as i say i

00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:53,119
i'm reluctant to speak for the board as

00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:56,319
to what that might be

00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:57,839
i would expect it will go beyond it will

00:45:56,319 --> 00:46:00,960
go beyond

00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:01,280
just selecting people to be on the board

00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,200
of

00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,119
of the python software foundation i

00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,440
think other things will be tried that

00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:08,079
will

00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,920
also help bring people into leadership

00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:13,040
of the psf from around the world

00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:14,000
that is my hope all right well thank you

00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,640
very much naomi

00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,000
once again for that fantastic talk we

00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:21,440
appreciate you having me

00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:24,960
it was a pleasure and uh if anyone else

00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:28,480
has any questions for naomi um please uh

00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:30,160
uh feel free to chat with her on discord

00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,480
so there's a whole room for this

00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:34,079
if you uh search for talk conferences

00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,079
during covet 19

00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:37,520
uh actually was it was that the one no

00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,119
actually i wonder if we even have a

00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,040
breakout room for you

00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:42,480
yeah i think it's their staying for the

00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,200
community i think is what you would

00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,640
search for

00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,000
oh yeah there it is talk standing for

00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,560
the community yeah see there's a similar

00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,119
talk too

00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:50,960
something got lost okay so it's a talk

00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,640
staying for the community and microsoft

00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,319
breakouts and if you have any other

00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,359
questions or want to discuss this with

00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:58,480
