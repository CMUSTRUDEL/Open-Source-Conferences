By Nicholas Tollervey

One of the best aspects of any conference, and EuroPython in particular, is the corridor track. It's when you walk around the physical conference venue and bump into an old buddy, find yourself striking up a conversation with a friendly co-attendee in the coffee queue, or join a huddle of welcoming folks discussing something interesting. The corridor track is where the community comes alive.

How do we remotely recreate the opportunity for chance encounters, unexpected conversation and exploration of a venue and new city with friends?

We already have a template for a solution: MUDs (multi-user dungeons/dimensions), back in the day, were hugely popular virtual worlds of text. I asked myself, ""what would a MUD written in 2020 look like?"". Then, rather foolishly, ""how hard can this be?"". Happily, I'd written a MUD in Python as a recent entry to PyWeek.

This talk describes how I initially created, extended and then refined my very own MUD, written in Python using asyncio, structlog, sly, redis and other fun technology. What's more, this MUD is special because it's a programmable MUD: it's really a multi-user development platform for on-the-fly coding of interactive virtual worlds.

What could possibly go wrong..? Let's find out..!

	00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,599
all right so

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:17,520
um please uh

00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:20,560
join me um giving a big clap to nicholas

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,199
go for it thank you so thanks for the

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,840
invite

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,080
um my name's nicholas and i'm a

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:29,679
freelance python developer

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,160
from the uk the focus of this talk might

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,079
not

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,680
be immediately apparent from the title

00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,200
so let me explain

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:39,600
a little uh in this talk uh what we're

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,200
going to do is explore

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,079
just a big subject how humans

00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:46,480
communicate via computers uh

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,960
how software influences the nature of

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,480
that communication

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,239
um we're also going to do a little bit

00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,440
of digital archaeology of

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:58,079
old technical solutions for this problem

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,239
and i'm going to sort of wrap up with a

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,879
show and tell of a fun brain break

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,760
experiment

00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,400
in recreating uh these solutions with

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,080
modern

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,040
technology uh but i want to set the

00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,320
scene

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,320
let me just move

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,479
i want to set the scene with this photo

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,759
from euro python 2011

00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,840
in florence and uh what it does is that

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,200
it captures the wonderful nature of the

00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,360
corridor track

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,640
as you can see well i'm actually stood

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,600
in the middle in the red

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,240
uh t-shirt and uh there's a collection

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,640
of folks

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,600
uh we all appear to be holding penny

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,600
whistles

00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,040
uh which seems appropriate for a

00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,920
conference that could have been held in

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,000
in dublin

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,600
uh and there's a guy with a guitar uh

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,880
strumming away with us it's it's

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,119
it's informal it's friendly it's diverse

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,079
and it's it's fun and this is why i love

00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,280
europaitan

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,560
it's a nice place to hang out and i get

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,880
to see my friends

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,119
and i get to make new ones most

00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:02,560
importantly

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,560
um so let me just rearrange

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:09,840
my windows so that i can see things

00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,400
um yet 2020 is the year we all learned

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,360
to try to stay close whilst remaining

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,040
at least in the uk two meters apart um

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,959
and this has been a difficult time as we

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,440
learn to change and adapt

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:23,040
to the new circumstances uh due to

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,680
coronavirus

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,959
um but i'm extremely grateful i want to

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,520
put this on public record

00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,480
uh for the volunteers who put on euro

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,080
python

00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,920
their efforts are often taken for

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,879
granted and you wouldn't believe the

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,239
amount of stress

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,720
and the number of problems they will

00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,640
have had to put up with so

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,000
this is especially so now that you're a

00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,160
python is remote

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,200
um and the current situation has also

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,319
brought into focus an important question

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,400
how could folks remotely recreate the

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,720
opportunity for chance encounters

00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,800
unexpected conversations and exploration

00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,360
of a venue and a new city with friends

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,000
which is

00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,560
the sort of thing that happens at europa

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,120
uh

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,879
how is such bonomi warmth and friendship

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,920
expressed most effectively through

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,720
a digital medium a remote digital medium

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,920
but perhaps more importantly how do we

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,920
foster tolerance

00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,040
and compassion or corrections of

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,040
misunderstanding

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,680
and all that other good stuff needed so

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,599
devour so a diverse community full of

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,680
differences and unique perspectives is

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:26,319
able to live with itself without

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,239
becoming

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,239
a fractured and toxic place

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,040
so you're a python has decided to use

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,519
discord

00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,319
um in this sense a chat service written

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,480
for gamers

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,680
now i don't know about you but i like

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,440
discord a lot

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,480
and i'm actually really pleased that

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,519
euro python organizers chose it

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,440
over other solutions

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,720
others being things like slack or

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,959
microsoft teams or google hangouts

00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,799
but discord is typical of the current

00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,680
state of the art in that they all look

00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,959
and function

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,400
similarly yet i don't actually feel that

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,439
comfortable at times

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:10,080
with the current state of the art so

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,959
let's start by exploring my problems and

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,680
discomfort

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,920
with with these platforms let's also try

00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:20,400
to imagine perhaps a more expressive

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:23,120
simpler or perhaps humane alternative to

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,479
um so i'm going to start by taking

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,160
discord to pieces

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,280
if you see what i mean to see what's

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,560
going on

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:35,680
actually uh there's a lot going on

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,479
in this application for those of us

00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,400
used to computers this is often easy to

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,040
miss this is rather a complicated user

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,720
interface that we can see in front of us

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:50,240
we are literally bombarded with data

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:53,759
metadata icons timestamps

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,160
reactions labels and silos are the norm

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,320
for remote written interactions such as

00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,600
those that we might have

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,600
through discord

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,360
and i'd also like to point out that

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,080
discord is also ultimately

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,600
a very transactional sort of way to

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,039
interact and i'll come to

00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:16,479
what i mean by that in a second um

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:19,840
but discord isn't uh

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,240
this isn't the case um for just discord

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,720
uh

00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,000
this is the case for other social media

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,039
sorts of platforms

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,280
so let's unpack that a little bit so

00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,800
this is twitter um there are familiar

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,880
patterns in twitter and

00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,160
this isn't so much a conversation as

00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,120
shouting into the void

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,400
through the inconvenience of a 280

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,680
character limits

00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,520
and look at where all the adverts are

00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,280
and here's facebook the redesigned

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,320
facebook

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,520
facebook feels to me the most mediated

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,400
platform

00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,800
this is most blatantly an exercise in

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,520
retaining my attention at all costs

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,600
rather than fostering a place for

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,080
conversation or making friends or being

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,199
friendly with people

00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,000
most problematic for me is the nature of

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,280
our interactions

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,280
with such platforms

00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,680
our interactions have become digital

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:20,880
transactions

00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:23,440
transactions have metadata for analysis

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,080
transactions are dislocated there's no

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,720
sense of

00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:30,960
place or occasion to such transactions

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,880
transactions are impersonal such as with

00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,199
twitter shouting into the void as it

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,240
were

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:38,880
it's hard to have a conversation

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,280
transactions are evaluated so we get to

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,520
see

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,800
likes and retweets and reactions it's

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:48,000
turned into a sort of popularity game

00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,720
and transactions sadly are curated by

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,280
platforms to capture our attention click

00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,160
here

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,840
react reply share or only show those

00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,120
things that are most relevant to you

00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:00,960
well who decides what that is sadly

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,039
our socializing is reduced to

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,680
interactions that standardize

00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,759
process and normalize our lives into a

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,560
digital production line of uniform

00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,199
social outputs like something post a

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,120
picture

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,039
reply with a comment set your mood that

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,520
sort of thing

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,199
the messy complicated and raw aspects of

00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,840
life which i would argue with the most

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,639
valuable

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,400
fun and interesting are lost or have no

00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,160
way to manifest themselves through these

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,240
sorts of platforms

00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,880
we've commoditized ourselves into a

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:35,039
dribble of systematized digital assets

00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:38,000
photos posts likes that sort of thing

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,520
and also ah is it just me but why do i

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,199
always get the impression that the

00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,000
design of social media

00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,560
has been designed by peppa pig soft

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,879
colors

00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,520
cute neutral and just a little bit

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,960
infantile in tone

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,840
or perhaps i'm just getting old

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,000
uh i'm the digital version of damn kids

00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,560
get off my lawn

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
or perhaps current technical solutions

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,720
to remote collaboration

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,479
community and friendship feel like i'm

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,120
being analyzed

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,919
my attention is being manipulated and i

00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,160
either have

00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,039
to pay or see adverts to get anything

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,599
done

00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,400
none of which is conclude conducive to

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,199
me

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,840
to making a place where i can have

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:26,240
humane

00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:29,840
conversations and make friends

00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:33,120
so given the lockdown situation

00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,640
that we face i ask myself could there be

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,680
a more

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,959
natural way creative way

00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:45,120
simple way expressive way

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:48,640
respectful way authentic way

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:51,120
to meet make friends and interact

00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,120
online

00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,440
how do we remotely recreate the

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,839
opportunity for chance encounters

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,480
unexpected conversation and exploration

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,680
of a venue and a new city with friends

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:08,640
but online rather than in dublin how

00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,880
could we recreate the online equivalent

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,800
of our beloved corridor track where

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,440
all these friendships and lovely

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,560
conversations happen

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,560
and then as if by magic

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,760
i remembered a distant memory from my

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,720
childhood

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,080
text-based worlds with epic stories

00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,120
curious locations

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:37,839
and imaginative adventures and this got

00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:40,480
me thinking

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,160
so there's a bug in firefox that means i

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,680
just have to reload this iframe so here

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:47,040
we go so bear with me

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,320
as i go on an adventure into computer

00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,519
history

00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,519
for for the youngans uh this is what a

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,480
text-based adventure game looks like

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,399
and feels like this actually is douglas

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,000
adams own recreation of his novel the

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,360
hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,480
as a text-based yet interactive virtual

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,680
world

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,240
so let me explain the mechanics of this

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,079
um text is displayed on the screen the

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,440
screen is up here for me um

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,200
so if i'm looking away you know i'm

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,040
looking at my slides here

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,720
and i type commands in and then

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,040
reactions happen so

00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,240
uh you wake up the room is spinning very

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,160
gently around your head

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,839
or at least it would be if you could see

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,399
it which you can't

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,760
it is pitch black i don't know let's

00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,079
have a look around

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,920
ah nope it's pitch black so i don't know

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:37,440
like let's try to switch

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:38,720
on the light good start pity it's going

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,399
to be the worst day of your life

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,399
the light is now on and then we get a

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,640
description and we get to see what sort

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,200
of

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,000
objects are currently in the room so i

00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,600
don't know if i

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,959
get all the objects because you know i'm

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,160
probably going to need them later on in

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,480
my adventure

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,440
um i can't do that because i'm still in

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,560
bed

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,480
right okay so why don't i stand up

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,079
this is very difficult but i manage it i

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,440
seem to have a hangover by the looks of

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,480
the descriptions in the text that's

00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,680
coming back

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:07,040
okay let me get all the things and

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,800
what have i got a telephone a

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,519
screwdriver toothbrush and a gown

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,880
okay so why don't i put on the gown

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,040
because that's what arthur dent

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,680
is famous for wearing a gown i wear a

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,360
gown and if i examine

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,959
the gown this might tell me something a

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,040
bit more about what it is so

00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,680
the dressing gown is faded and battered

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,440
clearly garment has seen better decades

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,680
it has a pocket which is closed and a

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,760
small loop at the back of the collar

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,519
okay that pocket looks interesting so

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:37,760
let's open the

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:39,440
pocket okay something my aunt gave me

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,760
buffered analgesic that'll be good for a

00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,640
headache and pocket fluff so i don't

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,320
know let's take

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,839
the tablet i swallowed the tablet

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,920
after a few seconds the room begins to

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,160
calm down okay my headache has

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,680
gone okay so let me have a look around

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,399
again where are the exits

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,959
small bedroom wash basin near the exit

00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:02,000
heading south okay so i type s

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,279
to show that i'm going south i'm now in

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,040
the front porch

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,959
this is an enclosed report blah blah

00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,920
blah blah blah and on the doormat is a

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,760
part of junk mail

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,519
i've learned by playing adventure games

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,320
it's best to just take everything so i'm

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,600
gonna get

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,839
all because you never know when you

00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,160
might need it okay

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,920
i gather up the pile of mail and let's

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,160
step outside

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:24,000
okay so this is where the actual book

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,519
picks up isn't it it's where mr process

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,480
from the local council has a bunch of

00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,839
bulldozers

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,470
and he wants to knock down your house so

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,889
i don't know what can i do

00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:34,889
[Music]

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:41,279
lay down in the mud

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,680
so i don't know lie down

00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,519
that's better i can't speak english okay

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:49,040
so you get the idea

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:52,800
i type something and things happen okay

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:56,000
um and and it's quite good fun as well

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,000
um so

00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,240
that was a single-player text-based

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,320
virtual world

00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,120
um but soon after the appearance of such

00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:08,079
games some university students in the uk

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,079
invented mud

00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,440
a mod is a multi-user dungeon and it's a

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,600
multiplayer

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,040
text based adventure game a little bit

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,399
similar to the one that we've just seen

00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,040
and the video that i'm playing at the

00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,680
moment

00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,880
is of an interaction on the original mud

00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,800
that i recorded

00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:28,240
a few days ago um in it you'll have seen

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,720
that i've just finished chatting with a

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,519
wizard called pie wackett

00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,360
and at some point through the video i

00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,399
come a cropper with some rats you can

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,279
enjoy that as i

00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,079
keep talking but the thing about these

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,800
sorts of

00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,680
adventure games or muds is that they are

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,240
low-tech

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,680
um so i've actually connected via telnet

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,199
believe it or not although proper

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,839
clients are available

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,880
it's quirky there's humor imagination

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,519
playfulness

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,480
but sometimes it is serious it's

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,880
literary

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,600
so there's a narrative there um there's

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,519
a sense of place and time and genre

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,120
and in this case we're in a fantasy

00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,959
world although we were in a sci-fi world

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:11,519
with hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy

00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:15,040
and actually it's a lot of fun

00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:17,360
there's also many varieties of mud

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,399
in the mid 1990s when i was at

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,600
university

00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,360
i would play on something called moo

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,120
moo is an acronym for a multi-user

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,199
dungeon that's object oriented

00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,399
and in a moo what's interesting is the

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,199
textual world

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,320
is a collection of user-generated

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,720
objects

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,399
users program the behavior of the world

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,000
as well as inhabiting it as well

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,560
it becomes an interactive development

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,560
environment

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:46,399
and that's in contrast to the mud that

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,680
we've just seen which has been

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,959
programmed by someone that

00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,959
everybody collectively plays

00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,880
um so muds and news became very popular

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,360
before

00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,480
all the toxic aspects of current social

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,800
media platforms

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,680
such behaviors were sadly manifested in

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,920
these virtual

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,000
textual worlds a most famously

00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,279
documented by julian dibbles

00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,680
a rape in cyberspace which i

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,720
highly recommend it's a very thoughtful

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,800
piece

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,240
yet at the same time these were

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,399
progressive places

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,160
and i made many friends all over the

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,880
world at a time when such things were

00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,199
still viewed with incredulity

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,360
social scientists psychologists literary

00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,079
critics artists and educators all got

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,040
interested

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:33,120
in these platforms mit professor sherry

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,920
turkle famously analyzed such online

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,079
role playing

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,519
as a way for folks to explore different

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:39,920
aspects of their identity

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:41,519
in a relatively safe manner the

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,440
challenges that may arise in such

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,560
platforms would allow folks to reflect

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,720
upon their behavior

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,399
and get to know more about themselves a

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,839
sort of narrative development of their

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,880
lives

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,000
now being british i spent most of my

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,759
time asking my fellow

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,079
players what the weather was like where

00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:00,160
they were be that san francisco paris

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,560
tel aviv or singapore

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,839
this for me was strangely satisfying and

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,759
it made me feel

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,759
like a true citizen of the global

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,160
village delivered via the information

00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:13,199
super highway that was my 56k

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:16,399
modem in the 1990s

00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,320
i also built a textual interactive

00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,759
representation of a remote scottish

00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,480
island that my girlfriend

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,480
now my wife and i visited over the

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,560
summer of 1995.

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,560
i still have a backup and it's an

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,759
interactive digital memento

00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:34,320
of my 21 year old self it was

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,199
and it continues to be fun to write

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,199
explore

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,199
and interact within such worlds

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:44,000
this all feels very low-tech but i like

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,839
that

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,680
i don't miss the transactional and

00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,399
manipulative nature of the current state

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,360
of the art

00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,720
and the focus is definitely on being in

00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,040
a specific place

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,639
in a certain moment with particular

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,959
sorts of people

00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,920
the things i love about words are that

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,800
they are

00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,319
well tell rather than show the user's

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,160
imagination is paramount

00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,000
and this is reflected in the simple and

00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,400
uncluttered user interfaces

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,360
where the text is most important they

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,600
could be playful

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,760
or serious but always tell a story

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,679
within a recognizable literary genre

00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,319
that sets the scene for interactions

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,760
between

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:23,439
users whereas graphical games focus on

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:26,000
hand-eye coordination

00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,120
and showing us things text-based worlds

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,200
put narrative

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,640
meaning and intent at the center of

00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,559
their process

00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,840
and while the reader may have more to do

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,919
with their imagination

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,880
i believe the reward is far greater for

00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,799
what you imagine

00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,960
will always have the best special

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,640
effects

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,720
literary worlds are also more

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,640
egalitarian and accessible

00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,320
they're within the realm of a single

00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,880
developer so there's

00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,480
very low overhead in technical terms

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,039
this to me reminds me of the difference

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,280
between

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,200
making a movie which requires thousands

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,280
of people or writing a novel

00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,200
which whilst still an onerous task is

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,640
something that a single person is able

00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,760
to do

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,720
so i ask myself what

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,200
would a mud or a moo written in 2020

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,440
look like

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,280
well as it happened i'd already answered

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,520
this question

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,600
pi week is a game jam for python

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,720
developers and it's organized by

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:25,039
the amazing and hugely talented dan pope

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,240
uh it's a wonderful hidden gem of the

00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,160
python community

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,160
and i would hardly recommend that you

00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,440
should try it it's a very friendly place

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,559
and it doesn't matter if you've never

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,559
written a game before

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,000
you'll have a blast i've had a wonderful

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:39,919
time um

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,520
and in 2019 with my buddy andrew smith

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,760
um i entered uh as a team

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,039
andrew is an author and a journalist so

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,360
we wanted to do something

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:51,600
text based and the theme that was given

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,520
for vespi week was six worlds

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,640
and we decided to create a simple

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,880
moonlight game

00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,679
where folks could build things add

00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,000
behavior

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,280
via a lisp-like scripting language and

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,679
interact with each other

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,720
in the style of six different literary

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,520
genres

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,200
jane austen poetic passions where

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,760
everything had to rhyme

00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,120
hard-boiled detective novels something

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:17,120
we called jrr

00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:19,679
fantasy sci-fi and future worlds

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,120
and of course something that we called

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,440
parry hotter

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:27,280
so that we wouldn't infringe somebody's

00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,280
copyrights but you get the idea

00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:34,320
um however

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,320
techsmith was born

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,760
but it was written in a week of furious

00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,000
coding

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,880
note the minimal book-like user

00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,200
interface

00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,160
and the focus is definitely on

00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,480
creativity

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,280
exploration a sense of place and a

00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,840
genuine

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:53,840
and genuine textual interactions with

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,840
others

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,120
this was incomplete but folks could make

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,039
objects

00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,039
and we had the start of a lispy

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:06,960
scripting language to make the world

00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:09,520
come alive and programmable the video

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,960
is a short exploration through the world

00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,400
it's browser-based with

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,559
websockets handling everything in the

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,280
background and while familiar in modus

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,120
operandi

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,799
the user is moving between places and

00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,640
meeting other users we've added a

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,799
multimedia spin to things

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,559
too as you can see there are pictures

00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,440
and you can see i'm just about to start

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,960
some audio which

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,640
obviously i've not captured in this

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,679
particular video

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,000
it adds to the atmosphere um

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,200
i'm almost tempted to think of this as a

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,280
multi-user

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,280
social jupiter notebook

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,039
and of course as we interact with the

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,280
game and say things and so on

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,039
it looks as if it's a printed word this

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:50,480
is important for us too

00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,480
we're focusing on the text

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:58,080
happily we came forth in the team

00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:00,400
category which is our best result ever

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,600
and folks appeared to like it the idea

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:03,760
for this is unique

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,520
this has great potential really cool

00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,200
entry really would have liked to see

00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,880
that scheme-like scripting language

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,080
mentioned in the help text i think it

00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,320
would have pushed this over into

00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,480
extremely cool no matter what territory

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:17,840
and also would have inclined me to play

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,840
with it way more

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,679
so i set myself a mission to finish

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,679
techsmith

00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,440
i've had so much fun that i couldn't

00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,039
stop reading about mods

00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,440
or coding on text me my desire to write

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,559
create imagine play and explore fueled

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,880
my enthusiasm

00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,600
as did my growing dissatisfaction and

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,520
unease

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,440
with the current state of the art for

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,480
chat or text-based interactions

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,320
on the internet since the uk like

00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:49,360
everywhere else was in lockdown

00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:52,960
i decided to entertain myself after work

00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:55,919
by rewriting techsmith properly

00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,799
i had to turn a week of hacks into

00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,200
something

00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,080
that i would like you know i could share

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,799
with people

00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,080
it has full test coverage docs scalable

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,159
architecture and so on

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:10,240
in other words code i'd want to show the

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,240
world like here at europe

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:15,760
and i did my research which uh was

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:19,600
remarkably good fun

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:21,120
um starting at the top designing virtual

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,200
worlds uh was written

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,240
by richard bartle who created the

00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,840
world's very first

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,600
mud and it's a sort of a bible really

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,520
for those people who are interested

00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,000
in this sort of thing and it's also a

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,559
cracking good read i highly recommend it

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,440
a theory of fun by rave costa is also

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,919
very good and it's

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,760
actually cartoons and writing so it's a

00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,960
playful sort of a book and rafe was

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:47,120
uh has been involved in uh an awful lot

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,080
of massively multiplayer online games

00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,600
in his time my tiny life by the

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,000
aforementioned julian devil

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,480
is a good historical context about what

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,520
was going on back in the 1990s in these

00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,840
text-based worlds and contains not just

00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,080
the

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,120
the infamous or famous rape and

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,080
cyberspace

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,960
um paper but but many many more that

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,720
deals with

00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,480
different aspects of how people

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,039
communicate and interact

00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,280
and build and make things in a digital

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:17,280
world

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,400
if you remember i mentioned moo as being

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,880
a type of mud

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,400
well the original moon called landamu

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,600
was created by a chap

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,960
from xerox park called pavel curtis and

00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,120
so i managed to find

00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,880
a version of this online still online

00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,640
the lambda moo programmers manual

00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,520
and this was a great technical

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,880
inspiration for me

00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,880
and then finally there's uh get lamp

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,640
which is actually a documentary a

00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,360
creative commons license documentary

00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:45,279
about

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,640
adventure games and this sort of genre

00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,320
it also um

00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,279
looks at interactive fiction and things

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,360
like that um and if you're interested in

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:55,440
finding out more about these resources

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,559
and i i if you're interested i hope you

00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,760
you do uh the the slides for this talk

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,080
are linked from

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,120
the page for this talk uh on the aura

00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,120
python website

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,400
so you'll be able to come through and

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,799
and follow the links

00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,799
yourself

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,279
this was all remarkably good fun

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:21,760
so how does the revised techsmith

00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:25,039
add up what parts become the sum total

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,039
of text smith

00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:32,240
so let's look at our little

00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,200
uh diagram here at the top is basically

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,760
the front end

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,360
at the bottom is is redis which is the

00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,640
data back end and in the middle is

00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,720
obviously the middleware

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,679
let me take you through each of these

00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,520
aspects of

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:48,640
the uh of the platform in turn

00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:52,000
so starting top left quart

00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,960
is an async i o web framework alar flask

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,480
in fact the api is exactly the same um

00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,840
and this is the thing that provides

00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,240
websocket support and the website for

00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,400
techsmith

00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,799
now phil jones who's the maintainer and

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,960
creator of court does an amazing job

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,559
and i have to say put it on record that

00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,360
this has been an absolute joy

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:13,039
to use so if you are familiar with flask

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,600
and you want to do some async io

00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:17,360
sort of development um quartz is

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,400
definitely the way to go

00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,960
of course output to the user is framed

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,320
within

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,880
ginger templates um that's nothing out

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,039
of the

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,240
way about that um and then we get to

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,559
babel uh

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,760
for internationalization um and this

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:35,039
slots really neatly

00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:38,559
uh due to a flask plug-in into quartz

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:40,480
so techsmith is fully translatable

00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:43,039
text-based virtual worlds are not just

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:45,200
english virtual worlds

00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:47,039
and i want my coach to respect and

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,760
acknowledge the diversity of folks

00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,159
who may use it in whatever language they

00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:53,840
might

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:57,200
want to use it in the middleware

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:58,559
of the app is all python async io

00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,000
and i use some really wonderful

00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:05,279
libraries to help make this easy to code

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,120
if you look on the right uh struct log

00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,960
i'd like to point out it's a really

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,159
helpful way of letting me

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:15,760
see what the application is doing um

00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:19,279
it's uh it emits structured logging um

00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:22,640
uh either using the 12 factor app um

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:24,400
uh scheme for for for web apps um

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,480
and it's just slotted in and it worked

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,799
perfectly so thanks heineck

00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,559
um and the other async i o related

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,279
libraries for things like connecting to

00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:34,000
redis

00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,720
processing forms uh working with email

00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,080
and things like that

00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:40,240
they just worked for me uh and i uh

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,000
i was a bit cautious about using async

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,320
io because i know it's perhaps

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,679
the ecosystem with async io is perhaps

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,640
not as

00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,919
mature as uh as other places in the

00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,080
python ecosystem but

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,120
everything just worked for me which is

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,400
real great

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,640
uh great joy in terms of coding

00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,240
um on the right hand side you'll see a

00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,600
gentleman that might look familiar due

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,799
to keynotes at previous

00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,840
euro pythons a very sly looking dave

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,080
beasley

00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,720
sly stands it's four it's a one of these

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:14,000
three letter recursive acronyms sly

00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,880
is a lex yak thing um so sly

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,760
lex yak and this is a module that dave

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,760
has written

00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,919
that i use to process the nascent

00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,760
lisp-like scripting language used by

00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:26,799
players to create the behavior

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,960
of the textual world dave's work has

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,799
been a fun way for me to learn about the

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,720
language design

00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,240
and learn about language design and

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,679
implementation and all that other good

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,080
stuff which is part of computer science

00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,440
that

00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,960
i'm not that familiar with i'm actually

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,240
a classically trained musician so i

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,440
don't have a computer science degree so

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,440
this was great fun

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,559
um but there's still lots of work to do

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,880
on that front

00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:49,200
and finally redis is used as an object

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,159
store but where python dictionaries

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,399
become json objects stored against a key

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,399
redis is a fantastic key value data

00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,360
store with a host of simple yet powerful

00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:59,360
features

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,080
i've been very impressed with it so far

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,600
it also comes with a message queue

00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,919
that's used by techsmith for

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,960
inter-object communication

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:11,600
for example if a user an object

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,520
says something in a room another object

00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,360
then a message from the user describing

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,600
what's been said is sent to the room

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,960
via the message queue then the room

00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,200
itself will send

00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,559
messages to objects representing other

00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,760
users in the room

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:27,840
telling them someone has said something

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,679
it is these messages that the users

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,559
receive saying you know fred has said

00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,960
hello

00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,720
that are sent to the user's browser via

00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,640
the websockets

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,080
techsmith is also designed to be

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,159
scalable as well

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,360
so you can have as many python instances

00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,679
of the application as you want

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:45,360
because they scale horizontally and all

00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,480
the interactions between these these

00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,760
nodes as it were

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,240
uh are through the the redis message

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,480
queue

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,600
and of course at the back is uh is a

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,840
redis cluster

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,760
behind all this uh however you could

00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,520
just always run this as a single app

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,960
with redis running on the same

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:06,799
box so how does it work

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:09,679
in terms of working with the user

00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:12,880
how is user input handled well we have

00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:15,679
the following workflow

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:18,159
we escape any html if the user input

00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:20,159
that's very important first

00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,240
then we handle special shortcuts that

00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:24,799
allow people to say things

00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,600
shout things emote things or say

00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:29,679
something directly to a person

00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,440
if the input doesn't match that we check

00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,000
if the first word in the sentence is a

00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,679
built-in verb like get drop build what

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,360
have you and then we pass

00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:39,039
on the handling of the rest of that

00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:42,320
message to the built-in

00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,880
function within text if that doesn't

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,720
match

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,320
we break the sentence down into

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,480
grammatical parts

00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,360
the verb the direct object the

00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,200
preposition

00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,200
the indirect object i'll come to what

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,520
those mean in a second

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:56,720
then what we do is we match the verb to

00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,039
an attribute name

00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,720
of objects in the room and we do that

00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,279
with a sort of order of precedence so we

00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,240
check

00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,200
if the verb is an attribute of the user

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,120
if it's not

00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,120
we check if the verb is an attribute of

00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:12,480
the room and then the direct object an

00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,480
indirect object if they exist

00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,640
and then we place that attribute value

00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,600
in the necessary message queues

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,240
now if the value of that attribute is a

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,240
string

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:27,279
starting with hashbang we evaluate that

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:30,559
as a script so

00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:33,679
for instance if the whistle object has

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:35,120
a blow attribute with the value the

00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,840
whistle toots

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,720
then the command blow whistle will

00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,039
result in

00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,760
the whistle toots being displayed to

00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:45,200
everyone

00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:47,200
in the room the verb

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,880
blow was matched against the whistle

00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,399
object

00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:55,679
and therefore the value of the attribute

00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,679
blow was displayed

00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:01,200
so let's just have a quick revision of

00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:04,480
of grammar from primary school

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:07,840
so uh if we have the command stack

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:10,000
treasure on table the verb is stack

00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,279
the direct object is treasure the

00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,640
preposition is

00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:16,159
on and the indirect object is table now

00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,000
of course this changes depending on the

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,399
locale or the natural language that the

00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,320
user is using to interact with

00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:25,360
techsmith and this is something that we

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,760
need to handle ourselves

00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,200
um so i mentioned script and the

00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,240
scripting language it's a very simple

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,960
lisp-like thing

00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,960
how does that work well it's definitely

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,200
a work in progress i can tell you

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,279
but scripts are evaluated in a

00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,559
particular context that contains the

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:43,760
following things

00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:45,360
the user who gave the command the room

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,519
in which the user finds themselves

00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,480
the exits from the room the other users

00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:51,760
in the room

00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,519
things of the object in the room this

00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,600
which is the object that matched the

00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,919
verb the direct object

00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,039
and the preposition an indirect object

00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:03,200
if they exist

00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:04,799
and of course the raw user input

00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,559
scripts must complete within a certain

00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,559
period of time so we don't hold up the

00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,760
game or report that they've run out of

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:12,480
time

00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,919
scripts may also only update objects

00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,000
within the context that they find

00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:18,480
themselves in

00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,200
scripts execute with the privileges of

00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,600
the user

00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,200
who cause them to root to run so if a

00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,159
script tries to change the description

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,559
of an object

00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,360
that i don't have permission to change

00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:30,399
then the script

00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,799
will fail and script

00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:34,000
may only emit messages to object in its

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:37,279
current context

00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
as well and of course if the script

00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:40,240
fails

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,919
users get a meaningful error message or

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,600
a stack trace

00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:45,039
and that's just the user who try to run

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,320
the script of course the last thing we

00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:50,640
want is to fill a room

00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:54,159
full of stack traces so

00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:57,840
that's essentially how the script works

00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,840
what's the current status of techsmith

00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:04,799
well techsmith i is i estimate

00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:06,720
80 finish i'm having fun and speculating

00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,919
about how people could creatively

00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,080
connect with each other

00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,760
through code that promotes a space for

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:15,120
playful or serious

00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:18,159
interactions but as they say

00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:19,919
i've only got the other 80 to go um now

00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:23,200
that's doubly so in this case

00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:25,440
because um that other 80

00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,559
is going to be the worlds that are built

00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,279
within

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,279
text smith

00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:37,440
so we're coming to the end now

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,640
um and we'll have a bit of time for

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,080
questions in a moment

00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,640
um but all of this makes me think of

00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,519
nested

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,039
textual systems um and those of you

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,320
who've read go to leicester bar

00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,640
see where this is going very very

00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,640
quickly um there are in essence

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,640
textual systems within textual systems

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:57,519
within textual systems going on here

00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,760
okay so for instance python is a

00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:02,080
text-based programming language

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,640
techsmith is a multi-user platform for

00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:07,919
building interactive textual worlds

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:11,200
and the textual world inhabited by

00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:14,720
um and meaningful to the users

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:17,839
is built on techsmith which is built on

00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,720
python okay so it's a bit like what we

00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:22,480
can see on this

00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:24,960
slide here we see a picture

00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,399
but we also see a hand holding a ball in

00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,480
a picture

00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,760
and we see the artist reflected in a

00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,040
ball held

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,560
by a hand in the picture so

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,560
it's kind of not turtles all the way

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:41,200
down it's abstractions

00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:43,839
all the way down so in conclusion

00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:45,679
technology cannot alas of itself stop

00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:49,760
folks from being rude

00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:51,679
thoughtless ignorant or intolerant

00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,359
but that shouldn't stop us from trying

00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:56,159
to imagine and create technology

00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,680
that emphasizes our humanity autonomy

00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,920
and promotes mutual respect

00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,320
tolerance and compassion in a diverse

00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:05,920
and cosmopolitan society

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,560
techsmith is a goofy game techsmith is

00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,960
also

00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,240
a kind of a thought experiment in code

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,079
but most of all

00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,280
it's a multi-user collaborative

00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,359
development platform

00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,320
for creating and inhabiting interactive

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:21,599
textual and multimedia literary worlds

00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,960
all this without transactions analysis

00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:24,880
of your social graph

00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,960
manipulation of your attention or

00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:28,560
clickbait adverts tailored to your user

00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,359
profile

00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:34,240
you can find the code and the docs in

00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:36,240
the links that are in the current slide

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,280
and for those of you who are interested

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:39,440
in finding more

00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,960
finding out more about mods and moves

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,520
and all that other good stuff

00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,480
um i highly recommend the titans of text

00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,040
podcast

00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,400
it's us-based and that's great fun they

00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,079
get all sorts of people talking about

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,400
interesting modern mood related things

00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,880
there

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,040
and it's also at times quite thoughtful

00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,400
um there's also the mud coders guild i'm

00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,200
not the only one doing this sort of

00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,520
silly thing

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,119
um there's actually a remarkable amount

00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,800
of people doing this sort of thing and i

00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,640
was really pleased to find this place

00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,240
uh they have a slack channel and there's

00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,119
some really stimulating conversation

00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,359
going on there

00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,160
and there's also a multi-user dungeon

00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,680
server

00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,280
on discord as well which of course

00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,680
you'll need to find uh you'll need to

00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,520
get

00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,720
a in an invite for but you could

00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:20,000
probably get that through

00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:23,599
people in the mud coders guild

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,200
so um i'm pretty much on time i guess

00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,400
for a few minutes of questions

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:31,920
so are there any questions

00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:34,480
thank you very much thank you nicholas

00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,240
you are you are on time indeed um so

00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,720
just a reminder if you want to drop a

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,640
question

00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:43,119
use the qa q a function on zoom so

00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,800
we have a question from thomas um you

00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,960
said it is translatable to other

00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,839
languages does that also apply to the

00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,480
grammar used

00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:52,400
to analyze sentences i knew i'd get a

00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:55,200
question about that

00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,240
not yet but the mechanism is in place so

00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,000
i'm writing this

00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:00,240
obviously i'm an english speaker and i'm

00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,079
writing this with english in mind

00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,680
but there are certainly going to be

00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,599
stubs well you can see

00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,119
even now there are stubs in the code

00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,560
where it is

00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,160
doing the equivalent of a case statement

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,680
i guess a switch case statement

00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,200
that's working out what the user's

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:16,800
preferred locale is

00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,640
um and it will uh it will

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,800
analyze the grammar in the appropriate

00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,240
sort of way um error messages and things

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,040
like that are also translatable you'll

00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,160
see that

00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,079
all the strings in in text with a babel

00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:30,880
translated

00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:33,200
awesome um rhys is asking what's your

00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,839
take on vr being applied to mods or

00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:38,240
moves

00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:41,280
um so i'm assuming uh sort of

00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,640
you mean uh graphical um presence in a

00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,160
virtual space

00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:49,520
um i think it's it's it's great fun

00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:52,640
um uh my son has an oculus

00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:54,800
thing whatever it is he wears and uh he

00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,920
he likes using that and playing games

00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,040
and things like that and he tells me

00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,359
that firefox have

00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,079
um some sort of firefox laps type thing

00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:02,560
that uh

00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,800
that allow that will allow him to to be

00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:07,839
present with his friends who also own

00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,000
um the same uh model of

00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,680
uh of device they've not figured out a

00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,960
standard yet that's yet to come

00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,960
i mean that's interesting it's like

00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,240
lawnmower man um another

00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:21,599
reference to the 1990s there um

00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:24,720
but uh i like text uh

00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:25,440
call me old-fashioned um uh i like the

00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,480
fact that

00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,320
i can let my imagination fly and text is

00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,400
perhaps the best way of letting that

00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,000
happen and the thing about muds is that

00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,480
because it's not just

00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:37,599
transactions of conversation going on

00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,440
there's a place

00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,520
there's a sense of traveling around

00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,359
there are objects

00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,200
there are ways to sort of interact with

00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:48,480
players as well uh in a

00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,280
non-obvious way um i missed out a whole

00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,240
section on

00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,599
um some of the stuff that julian dibble

00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,160
mentioned some of the innovations that

00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:56,560
we still

00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,280
don't see in uh in current text based

00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,960
systems

00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,520
uh that were sort of invented and used

00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,680
in muds and moves in previous decades

00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,800
so in a sense they're also at the very

00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,440
forefront of technology

00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,640
and waiting for folks to catch up so i

00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,680
don't know

00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,560
vr is cool you know i like space rockets

00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,560
and flying cars

00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,560
in that sort of way but i also like

00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:19,920
reading books and text-based things too

00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,920
i hope that answers your question cool

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,480
uh ben is asking are there new

00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:28,560
challenges to creating mods in 2020 that

00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,660
were not present in the 90s

00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,400
um

00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:35,040
[Laughter]

00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,040
i'm tempted to say yes our development

00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,560
environment and the cloud and kubernetes

00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:41,119
and amazon and

00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:43,359
all of that sort of stuff because in the

00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:45,440
1990s this was a single server

00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:47,520
uh you know a server running on a single

00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,160
box that usually had a host name that

00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,680
somebody

00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,440
you know it was that some it was their

00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:56,400
pet rather than cattle

00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:59,599
to use the terrible analogy that cloud

00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,240
users um and that in itself is kind of

00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,720
cute

00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,079
whereas as you've seen the the way i've

00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:07,760
tried to organize

00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:11,359
techsmith is as a

00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:14,640
modern web dynamic web application

00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:16,800
as well so um i would say we've learned

00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,480
a lot more about how to do this perhaps

00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,599
and the tools are more available i've

00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,440
got async io

00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,880
i've got quartz i've got redis and

00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,119
things like that so

00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,800
in a lot of senses i don't have to

00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,720
reinvent the wheel whereas folks in the

00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:32,000
1990s would have to do that

00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,680
um but uh yeah it's still a challenge

00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,560
because i have to imagine things and

00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:39,040
that hasn't changed

00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,839
all right thank you uh stanislav has a

00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,280
question as well

00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:43,680
have you tried using machine learning

00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:45,200
for generating content inside a game

00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,680
i remember seeing something like this in

00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,290
the world yeah okay so that was

00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,520
yes

00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:54,240
[Laughter]

00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,960
um so you're you're looking at maybe an

00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,160
open ai

00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:00,240
type um text generation here um

00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,839
so there was lots of discussion about

00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,760
this on some of the mud forums that i've

00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:05,760
been inhabiting over the last few months

00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,599
um the text generation for adventure

00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,240
games for single-player adventure games

00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,599
like the

00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,440
hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy thing

00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:14,640
that i showed as part of my talk

00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,640
that's happened um the corpus that was

00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,280
being used for that sort of stuff

00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,000
however uh was taken from social media

00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,200
and things

00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,119
and the quality whilst initially

00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,040
it looks cool and good and things the

00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,760
quality of it after a very short period

00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,160
of time

00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,760
um you get bored of it apparently this

00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,960
is what i was told by somebody who's

00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,640
been experimenting

00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:39,920
in the field with that sort of stuff um

00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:42,960
i've actually been uh

00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:45,040
i used a markov chain to generate um

00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,160
some room descriptions based on

00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:48,720
stuff that i've been scraping from from

00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:52,000
other

00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:53,920
mud's descriptions um so that uh

00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
all the fantasy ones we had lots of orcs

00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,359
and the elves of treflelion with their

00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,200
goblets of fire and

00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:01,200
all of this sort of stuff and that was

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:04,079
quite hilarious if a bit meaningless

00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,040
but i i really like that point and i

00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:08,560
think that there's

00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:11,920
uh room for lots of innovation in mud

00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:14,319
um and moo related uh

00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,640
engines for that sort of a thing and i'd

00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:18,720
like just like to point out that um

00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,760
because this is text-based making

00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:21,440
changes

00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:23,040
and playing around with these sorts of

00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:26,960
things is uh

00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:28,560
is it is a relatively low hanging fruit

00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,720
if i were doing this in a graphical game

00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,800
or a vr game or something like that

00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,800
um i would have a huge code base with

00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,920
lots of assets and making a change is is

00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,560
quite difficult to do

00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,440
this is just literally text comes in i

00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,680
do some stuff

00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:43,119
i put text on message queues text goes

00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:46,400
out that's essentially

00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:48,240
um the the the modus apparently of

00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,440
of this sort of thing i hope that

00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,400
answers your question that was a really

00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:55,119
great question enjoyed answering that

00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,599
thank you um i have i have one question

00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,560
um

00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:59,200
i i really like the idea of recording

00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,880
moments

00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,960
that that you said that you recorded

00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:06,400
that moment uh with your wife

00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:08,319
in scotland yeah like do you do

00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:10,839
how would you go about doing that like

00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:13,920
do you have do you have an example

00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:17,920
but uh so

00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,960
uh what i have is a virtual world that i

00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:24,000
created when i was

00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:27,200
21 and as somebody in his mid-40s now

00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,280
i can return to that and

00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,480
i don't know about you but uh i can't

00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,119
remember anything about the code i'd

00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:36,240
written six months ago let alone

00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,280
back in the mid 90s so it was fun to

00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,319
inhabit

00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:42,640
what was in my head in a textual sense

00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:43,839
from 20 odd years ago if you see what i

00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,040
mean um

00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:48,960
so i've got it it's a bit like it felt

00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,160
to me a little bit like reading my diary

00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,680
from

00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,839
way back when but this was an

00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,280
interactive diary and there were objects

00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:57,200
in the world and i could

00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,119
you know there was a picture photograph

00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,560
object on the mantelpiece object

00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,319
so i could look at the photograph and i

00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,280
could see the description and it was a

00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:05,359
photograph of

00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:07,119
of my wife's dog who was now passed away

00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:08,560
i'd forgotten about genie i was like oh

00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,920
gosh i remember jeannie

00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:12,319
you know and it brought back a flood of

00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,560
memories so um

00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:15,359
so that's how it felt like that's how it

00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:18,400
felt like

00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:19,839
um does that is that helpful yeah

00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,560
yeah it sounds like it's just like it's

00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:26,000
the structured um journal

00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:27,920
right right yeah sounds good

00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,680
yeah awesome um there's no more

00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,520
questions uh thanks nicholas for the

00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,359
for the great talk thank you you're

00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,720
welcome i'll stop sharing and and get

00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:38,079
out of here thanks a lot

00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:41,920
and always okay bye-bye

00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:44,960
all right so we are in a break now um
