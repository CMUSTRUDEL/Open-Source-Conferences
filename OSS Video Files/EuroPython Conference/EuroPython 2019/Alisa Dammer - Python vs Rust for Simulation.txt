	"Python vs Rust for Simulation
[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-10 - PyCharm]
[Basel, CH]

By Alisa Dammer

Both Python and Rust are getting more and more popularity. Although it is unfair to compare them directly, this talk aims to provide a clear comparison with a pre-defined criteria applied to a specific use-case. 
Writing a simulation engine is very similar to writing a game engine and requires certain features from a language or framework.
Possible comparison criteria: 
1. Performance
2. Simplicity
3. Amount of code necessary for a MVP
4. Utilities: docs, tests, profile
5. Compatibility
