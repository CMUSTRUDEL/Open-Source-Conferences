	00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:08,080
hi my name is Mark and this is my friend

00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,629
Chuck we are going to be introducing the

00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,429
lightning talks this is the best part of

00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:14,019
Europe - except for obviously the last

00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:18,550
talk because the speakers probably still

00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:20,530
here so in a moment I'm going to hand it

00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,370
over to check to explain the rules for

00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,660
the lightning talks for all the

00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:27,640
newcomers this like their hand up this

00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:30,190
morning so in fact that's very important

00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:34,330
to know the rules because we will tell

00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:37,210
you off if you violate the rules so for

00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:39,190
any talks that is promoting the other

00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:41,920
conferences you only have two minutes

00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,750
instead of five minutes so other talks

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,490
that's talking about something not

00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:52,810
remotely a conference you have five

00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:55,360
minutes also please remember don't we

00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:58,270
are friendly communities of please only

00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,950
positive noises don't boo people you'll

00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:06,759
be tore off if you do that so also when

00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:07,450
as usual if the speakers almost run out

00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:13,359
of time

00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:15,539
we'll do this can we practice yes and so

00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,740
that we make these annoying

00:01:15,539 --> 00:01:19,149
passive-aggressive noises to annoy the

00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,189
speaker so they know that they have to

00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:26,399
finish and when they're finish of course

00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:33,729
big clap you can share if you want to so

00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:39,310
thank you so also also our honey back to

00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:41,289
Marky she stole my bit so we're gonna

00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:43,060
practice that again there are three

00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:44,679
positive noises you will make at the end

00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,869
of every lightning talk this evening

00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:48,609
so the first noise is the clapping

00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:50,819
noises can we have a big loud clap

00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,819
please

00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:57,820
and the second noise is the whupping can

00:01:54,250 --> 00:02:00,310
we have lots of whooping please whoo and

00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,660
is the third noise which is the foot

00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:03,190
stamping can we have lots of foot

00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,790
stamping please on it's lovely wooden

00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,760
floor

00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:10,899
I now radomir if you'd like to take your

00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,980
place so we have inserted an extra slot

00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:13,240
in front of the lightning talks this

00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:15,640
evening we were going to do this every

00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,980
night this week

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,780
we're radomir who is the inventor of the

00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:26,070
pew pew system which we've all been

00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:28,420
given as part of our ticket

00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:30,160
so first Radomir is going to give a

00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:35,080
quick talk I believe about how the pew

00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:37,480
pew device came to be about that on

00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,550
Friday so I'm just going to explain how

00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,840
to use it

00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:42,640
and then we're going to have some quick

00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:44,530
demos of software that people have

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,870
written in the last few days on their

00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:48,310
few devices in the workshops and so we

00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,900
would encourage people in the next

00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,130
couple of days if you would like to come

00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,570
up to the stage at the lightning talks

00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:55,420
and give a quick demo of something

00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:57,130
you've built on your pew pew then talk

00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:59,500
to radomir and he'll be around the

00:02:57,130 --> 00:03:00,580
conference and we'll get you will get

00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,290
you up here to show everybody what

00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,430
you've done so that that's an extra a

00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,980
kind of lightning talk within a

00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,600
lightning talk it's gonna be great so

00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:17,739
can you make those three fantastic

00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:20,290
noises for radomir please okay so I only

00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:22,600
have a few minutes so I'll try to be

00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:25,870
very quick you probably have already

00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,340
received those things and if not then

00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:31,420
you can get them at the reception

00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:36,100
downstairs and wondering what they are

00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:39,220
so they're there I think that was

00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:42,790
designed to make a circuit python well

00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:45,030
to make Python games on a workshop

00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:47,470
the problem with workshops is that

00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:50,200
everybody brings their own laptop and

00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:52,570
everybody has something else in store on

00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,810
it everything except for the thing that

00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:58,660
you need for the workshop and you

00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,609
usually lose half of the workshop time

00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:01,400
just installing things and getting them

00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:05,659
to work

00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:08,599
and so on so once micro Python was

00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:10,730
created and after that circle Python

00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:14,689
which is a more beginner friendly

00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:18,109
version of micro Python I figured that

00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:20,900
why not create a device that lets you do

00:04:18,109 --> 00:04:23,810
that has everything installed on it

00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:26,240
already and then you just connect it to

00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:30,139
the computer and use any text editor you

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,330
have in there to do it that's easy to do

00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:37,520
because on silk with Python when you

00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:44,389
when you connect your device to the

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:49,789
computer like this and switch it off it

00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:53,120
will come up as a USB Drive called silk

00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:56,270
wheat pie and you can see files on the

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,340
USB Drive and those files are basically

00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,830
Python code that is running on the

00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,740
device there is also a readme file in

00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:05,750
here where you have a link to the full

00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:09,320
documentation that link is also printed

00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:13,300
on the back of the device and where you

00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:19,330
have a basic summary of the of the API

00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:24,430
for the device if we visit that link

00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:24,430
just copy it

00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:37,080
we will get the documentation on the

00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:39,300
read the docs of course there is the

00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,719
same library reference you have in the

00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:45,449
in the readme but also information about

00:05:42,719 --> 00:05:48,749
the device itself which is this version

00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:50,520
10.2 that this device is actually 10.3

00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:54,900
but electrically there are no

00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:56,460
differences so everything is online

00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,069
there are links in there in the

00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,770
community section to the mailing list

00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:04,080
the disco channel for circuit Python and

00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:06,569
to the github repository where you can

00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,050
find all the code in all the designs

00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:11,400
that's not important right now the

00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:14,219
important thing is that there is a

00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:17,089
bouncing ball tutorial in there which

00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:21,779
you can follow to program your device

00:06:17,089 --> 00:06:24,810
yourself as simple demo of a pixel going

00:06:21,779 --> 00:06:28,589
around the screen it's really step by

00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:32,129
step thing so hopefully it will be

00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:34,379
possible to follow it in like 20 minutes

00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:37,909
or something like that and then you will

00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:45,000
be ready to write your own things and

00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:47,699
the things you you make you know people

00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,449
have we already had the workshops the

00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:53,370
past two two days on Monday and Tuesday

00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:56,939
helping people to go through this

00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:59,159
tutorial and also to develop some new

00:06:56,939 --> 00:07:00,960
things for this device because it

00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:04,949
doesn't have to be gains right you can

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,560
display some some awesome animation and

00:07:04,949 --> 00:07:10,710
wear it through the conference to show

00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,889
off your programming skills and or have

00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:18,499
like a slogan scrolling there to show

00:07:13,889 --> 00:07:21,800
your political stance or whatever and

00:07:18,499 --> 00:07:23,919
yeah well be nice

00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:27,130
[Music]

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:47,530
things like that so we are going to show

00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:51,759
some of the camera here so that you can

00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:57,690
see it on the big screen hopefully I

00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,690
will just hold it and we can use

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:20,290
[Applause]

00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:53,680
microphone

00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:58,839
oh ok can someone guess what movie this

00:08:53,680 --> 00:09:00,550
is yes well this one is actually non

00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:04,870
interactive so if I press the buttons

00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:06,399
nothing happens or does it well you can

00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:11,550
try yourself because I will publish the

00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,550
code it's very short and yeah that's

00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:19,910
let's let's see if we can shadow this

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,640
okay now you can see this now we got

00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:24,950
with the pew pew a lot of nice games to

00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,470
play with so I thought we should need

00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:29,480
some serious software as well and that's

00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:33,529
why I wrote a text editor for the pew

00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:36,170
pew at the top corner you can see the

00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:37,790
cursor blinking at the bottom corner on

00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,649
the right you can see another cursor

00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,240
blinking showing you that you would need

00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:45,589
to scroll down to see the rest of the

00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:47,810
text so this of course as everybody it

00:09:45,589 --> 00:09:50,390
will understand is Morse code because

00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:52,790
Morse code usually has like five to six

00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:54,890
characters so it sits perfectly on the

00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:58,550
pew pew and the Morse code for the

00:09:54,890 --> 00:10:01,130
letter E is like dit so if I now play

00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:03,790
back the message you can read that it

00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,790
actually works

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:18,610
[Applause]

00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:20,620
now okay so I will give over Twitter a

00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,600
link where you can download this because

00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:27,090
this means like on parties you can then

00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:27,090
on-the-fly set the text of your pew pew

00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:38,380
hey it's me again so this is my device

00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:40,570
or how it weird its inception okay um so

00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:45,460
it's a heart blinking and then it could

00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:48,070
go very slow or very fast I'm excited

00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:51,520
and then it could be small it could be

00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:53,140
big and then um I could stop it I like

00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,910
my stop my heart stopped beating

00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,950
it could still go small but it's not

00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:06,759
beatings that's it

00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:06,759
[Applause]

00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:17,670
actually fiction because he made a 3d

00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:22,069
engine for it he deserts lighting the

00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:22,069
computer so thank you very much and

00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:32,510
and we will probably repeat that for

00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:35,390
every lightning talk so if you have

00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:38,270
anything if you have made anything with

00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:41,540
pew-pew and that you would like to show

00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:44,780
here please please come to the next

00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:47,630
lightning talks q in there and and we

00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:50,740
will let you let you throw it okay thank

00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:53,030
you thank you running man

00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:56,420
so if makes people would like to come

00:11:53,030 --> 00:12:00,110
and set up you're actually plugging in

00:11:56,420 --> 00:12:01,550
an app top excellent so you probably

00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:02,990
watched that and thought to yourself yes

00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:04,160
oh I need to get up on that stage how do

00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:05,840
I get up on that stage to give a

00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,410
lightning talk so I'm going to tell you

00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:10,670
how so our system I haven't encountered

00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,410
another conference with the system but

00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,630
with our system we've been using for

00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:17,620
about 12 years now there is a big sheet

00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:19,970
of paper downstairs on a column by the

00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:22,460
reception desk where you've got your

00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:24,800
badges and if you go along in the

00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:27,290
morning as early as possible you may

00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,120
find some space on that and you can use

00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:31,760
that space to write the title of your

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,160
talk your name as clearly as possible

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,480
and ideally your Twitter handle so we

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,070
can get in touch with you or your

00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:41,900
telegram handle if you're in the

00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:45,160
European group are you ready to go there

00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,160
is nothing on the screen though

00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:57,460
technical difficulties so this is when I

00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:57,460
tell a joke about a tractor

00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:06,649
so the farmer who lives near me though

00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:15,889
I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it they

00:13:06,649 --> 00:13:17,569
they love tractor jokes so there's a

00:13:15,889 --> 00:13:21,259
farmer who lives near me and he has this

00:13:17,569 --> 00:13:27,019
vehicle and he uses it to plow perfect

00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:29,470
circles I think it's a protractor I've

00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:32,669
come on it was a terrible joke

00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:32,669
[Applause]

00:13:33,129 --> 00:13:40,519
I'm not telling that tractor joke

00:13:35,629 --> 00:13:44,569
that's not my joke how we doing any

00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:49,819
closer so we're getting any feed into

00:13:44,569 --> 00:13:54,250
the okay I scream sprint announcement

00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:54,250
who went to the ice-cream springe today

00:13:54,550 --> 00:14:00,019
at lunchtime so I think that I've got to

00:13:58,550 --> 00:14:01,579
do it tomorrow because I found an

00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:04,610
ice-cream place which is laying around

00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:06,740
10 minutes walk from here near the river

00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:09,500
and near the bridge and the ice cream I

00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,899
would say is the best in this city even

00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:14,000
though I'm only here like my fight my

00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:16,189
fifth day is here but I think it's the

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:20,029
best ice cream in the world and yeah

00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:22,310
welcome to join me tomorrow lunchtime I

00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:24,769
would post I would call I would say in

00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:26,720
the telegram so you're welcome to have

00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:28,880
ice cream with me but cash only please

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:38,990
prepare cash and yeah I won't pay for

00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:41,120
you so yeah so more seriously in terms

00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:42,410
of the Lightning talks there don't seem

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,720
to be very many people here who haven't

00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:46,399
given a talk but if you haven't given a

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,990
talk and you would like to the lightning

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,670
talks are a great opportunity to do that

00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:51,500
there's loads of energy in the room you

00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:52,970
can talk for five minutes or less it's

00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,470
really important you can stand up and

00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,509
say something that's important to you in

00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:58,250
one minute if you want to and you will

00:14:56,509 --> 00:15:01,329
still get a huge round of applause from

00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,329
all the wonderful people in this room

00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:14,240
and that is my lightning job see

00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,220
normally I use these sorts to encourage

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,059
people to give talks but it turns out

00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,500
that everybody in the room is already

00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:21,829
given a talk and we've just had a

00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:23,870
keynote talk on giving I think Alex

00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:25,970
asked before who hasn't give a talk

00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:29,389
before when I give a talk

00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:32,059
ever ever ever before oh where the hands

00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:34,459
like it was some handsome yeah I see so

00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:36,620
yes the lightning talk is the perfect

00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:38,660
place to start your first talk because I

00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:41,839
could talk about my experience in Pike

00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:45,259
or Namibia so um yeah so I went to

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:47,809
Namibia I think somebody's gonna present

00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:49,910
about our hike on Africa later but my

00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:53,209
experience about going to Namibia is

00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:55,429
amazing so the first day of the

00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:57,139
conference and then people was like oh

00:15:55,429 --> 00:15:59,089
what's a lightning talk you know like

00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:01,790
that some of them like really is that

00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:03,559
the first Python conference there so so

00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:06,319
some of some of us we will travel all

00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:08,149
the way to Namibia so some of us like I

00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:09,920
already speak here so okay we

00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:12,050
demonstrate was a lightning talk and

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,939
like we kind of give it give a lightning

00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:16,100
talk about anything you know and then

00:16:13,939 --> 00:16:18,980
the next day there was a car you know

00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:21,050
like okay first of all people nemedians

00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,459
are lovely they laid the queue up for

00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,199
lightning talk the second day you know

00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:27,259
there's like some students you know like

00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:29,240
anybody and then one guy he just went up

00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:31,670
to the stage and he has no slides

00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:35,269
nothing rap tamai and then he was like

00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:37,730
oh actually today my brother's help me

00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:39,529
to come to this conference I came to

00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:44,079
this conference but have no idea what is

00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:49,149
a PI then he talked about his first

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:49,149
PyCon ever oh I'll tell the story later

00:16:49,240 --> 00:17:00,009
I just need to get my video playing all

00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:09,010
right

00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:12,640
oh okay hi I'm Christian and I wanted to

00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:15,429
show you something no I listen because I

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,439
need to answer I would show you

00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:19,649
something I did on my pew pew but it's

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,000
not something I did yesterday because

00:17:19,649 --> 00:17:23,709
I've actually worked with the pew pew

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:29,080
before so I wasn't in the group that

00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:30,789
showed that stuff before and I even did

00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,590
that before I even knew that I would be

00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:35,020
pupils at this conference oh that was a

00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:36,610
nice surprise for me to see that every

00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:39,070
one of you will now get one of these

00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:43,870
devices too and we'll be able to do the

00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:46,480
thing I did as well so I've been playing

00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:48,820
with micro pison for a while and in

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,620
particular I love these pew pew devices

00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:55,059
that autumn you invented and as you can

00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:57,940
see I own a couple of them so one day I

00:17:55,059 --> 00:18:02,140
asked myself whether I could make a 3d

00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:04,690
game on this device and so I sat down

00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:08,620
one weekend and if you try and to my own

00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:11,140
surprise it worked quite well you can

00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:14,110
try it for yourself here's the download

00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:19,570
link it will work on your country pew

00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:21,730
pew although slowly you can make it run

00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:23,919
a bit faster if you install the latest

00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:26,500
beta version of the circuit Python

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,510
firmware as instructions for that in the

00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:32,980
documentation in the link that you can

00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:34,779
find on the back of the device I want to

00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,200
give you a quick glimpse into how this

00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:37,419
was made

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,460
how do you do such a thing on such a

00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:42,130
small device with not much computing

00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:44,470
power and in a language like Python that

00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:48,460
is not optimized for runtime speed but

00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:50,470
for development speeds the usual

00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,380
approach of doing such games in the days

00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:57,610
before there was a 3d graphics hardware

00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:59,799
was a 2d array caster 2d because the map

00:18:57,610 --> 00:19:01,779
is actually two-dimensional all you can

00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:02,269
do in the third dimension is walls of a

00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:05,570
constant

00:19:02,269 --> 00:19:07,489
height you can texture the balls it's

00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:09,309
bit hard to see here because my camera

00:19:07,489 --> 00:19:11,869
has trouble with the bright display

00:19:09,309 --> 00:19:15,559
you cannot texture the floor in sealing

00:19:11,869 --> 00:19:17,779
these are just their flat colors ray

00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:19,669
caster I'm not going to go into much

00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:22,190
detail on what that is but it's pretty

00:19:19,669 --> 00:19:24,409
simple and involves some geometrical

00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:27,769
computations like finding intersections

00:19:24,409 --> 00:19:29,749
of line segments but there's two

00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:33,190
problems with this approach on such a

00:19:29,749 --> 00:19:35,239
small device first these geometrical

00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:37,909
computations are most easily done using

00:19:35,239 --> 00:19:39,739
floating-point numbers and the

00:19:37,909 --> 00:19:41,599
microcontroller in here does not have a

00:19:39,739 --> 00:19:43,969
floating-point unit so floating point

00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:47,749
math is low on here we only want to do

00:19:43,969 --> 00:19:50,389
integer math on this device and second

00:19:47,749 --> 00:19:52,279
to do this efficiently you need to put

00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:55,070
your geometry into some kind of data

00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:57,169
structure that will make it easy to look

00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:59,899
up efficiently what is we're in space

00:19:57,169 --> 00:20:01,549
and such data structures take memory and

00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:02,889
we don't have a lot of memory on here

00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:07,369
either

00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:10,190
so the approach I came up with is let's

00:20:07,369 --> 00:20:14,179
pick slate the world pixels are

00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:16,789
naturally integer based and my map now

00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:19,149
is basically a pixel image instead of a

00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:21,919
vector image as it was before

00:20:19,149 --> 00:20:24,169
now pixel images take some memory as

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,999
well but maybe I can make the pixels

00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:27,859
coarse enough that it still fits into

00:20:25,999 --> 00:20:30,019
memory after all you can't see much

00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:34,129
detail anyway on this small low

00:20:30,019 --> 00:20:36,440
resolution display and instead of doing

00:20:34,129 --> 00:20:39,859
exact math with these lines I now do

00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:42,259
pixelated lines to draw pixelated lines

00:20:39,859 --> 00:20:45,859
there is an efficient algorithm called

00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:49,639
bresenhem's algorithm that only uses

00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:51,769
integer math and even only additions not

00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:56,509
even multiplications so that's why it's

00:20:51,769 --> 00:20:58,849
very fast and that's it basically what

00:20:56,509 --> 00:21:01,789
principle implementing all this took

00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:04,759
little more than 100 lines of Python

00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:06,529
code and if you want to know more about

00:21:04,759 --> 00:21:09,709
they talk to me I'm here at the

00:21:06,529 --> 00:21:14,179
conference or contact me on Twitter or

00:21:09,709 --> 00:21:15,870
email me or anything else if you're a

00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:18,690
better game designer than I

00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:20,610
and are able to make a nice interesting

00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:23,400
game on top of this that would be

00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:24,990
awesome because myself I still haven't

00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,770
quite figured out what works and what

00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:34,890
doesn't on this low resolution display

00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:41,429
thank you and have fun that's amazing

00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:43,860
that's like that thing is like whoa very

quickly so that guy he's like he's

00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,789
really his first Python conference or

00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:54,210
maybe his first Python experience and

00:21:50,789 --> 00:22:01,919
then oh yeah we have very smooth so I'll

00:21:54,210 --> 00:22:06,390

back in the university and an outsize

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,879
lovely I've seen there's a ping-pong

00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:47,729
table there if you bring your you know

so yeah oh by the way I'm horrible with

00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:53,639
ping pong right so um even though like

00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:55,619
people think that like I'm you know I

00:23:53,639 --> 00:23:57,959
grew up in Hong Kong I'm Asian I've

00:23:55,619 --> 00:23:59,999
asked Nick only Chinese I suck at ping

00:23:57,959 --> 00:24:01,589
pong ball like icon pay ping pong ball

00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:04,919
I'll be like chasing the ball around

00:24:01,589 --> 00:24:07,049
because he bounced and then so there was

00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:09,539
a story look right so in my previous job

00:24:07,049 --> 00:24:11,879
so um we have like half the show show

00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:13,679
even with my colleagues and then we went

00:24:11,879 --> 00:24:15,779
to a place it's lifer famous in London

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,479
it's compounds so they have all these

00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:20,309
ping-pong table in the club so people

00:24:18,479 --> 00:24:22,320
will drink there and then also play some

00:24:20,309 --> 00:24:24,570
ping pong which is fun you know there's

00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,450
like all these like neon lights and

00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:29,309
stuff and then people assume that I am

00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:31,139
very good at ping pong but at the end

00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:33,239
they just all laugh at me because I was

00:24:31,139 --> 00:24:36,119
drunk and I was playing ping pong

00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:37,829
so basically this boy hitting my head it

00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:39,539
was like flying behind me and I was like

00:24:37,829 --> 00:24:41,519
looking around I was like you know

00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:43,679
finding the balls and stuff is hilarious

00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:45,899
so please don't get me drunk on Thursday

00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,369
and pay pink like and asked me to play

00:24:45,899 --> 00:24:50,429
ping pong ball because it would be a

00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:52,379
disaster so yeah enjoy Thursday it would

00:24:50,429 --> 00:24:55,829
be great I hope it's not raining so um

00:24:52,379 --> 00:24:57,119
yeah we'll be having grilled sausage

00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:59,639
I guess this morning if I pay attention

00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:01,379
yeah that would be great I love I love

00:24:59,639 --> 00:25:04,049
the German sausage like they are very

00:25:01,379 --> 00:25:06,299
tasty oh it's better than the British

00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:10,799
one I don't know why but like yes I like

00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:13,859
I like well well yeah it was seriously

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:17,219
I'm talking about the food yeah um so um

00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:20,249
yeah last year I went to Germany three

00:25:17,219 --> 00:25:22,049
times right so on the first and oh I

00:25:20,249 --> 00:25:26,060
went the first time I went it's like I

00:25:22,049 --> 00:25:40,010
went to Hamburg and yeah

00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:42,800
oh wait okay my name is Moses I'm from

00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:44,990
Brazil this lightning talk I actually

00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:48,560
prepared it for Euro Python last year

00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:50,270
but I couldn't make it in time like

00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:53,870
there are too many lightly talks and

00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:57,290
this is something called Fox dot so

00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:59,300
basically it plays some sounds and I'll

00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:01,850
skip this one so 0 was basically the

00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:05,900
same money we're listening so you can

00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:11,510
like change the note you can go through

00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:13,880
a list of notes or a chord if you know

00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:15,560
which one's the right wants to play but

00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,380
if you try to make some math it will

00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:21,860
break as you can see down there in the

00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:25,790
console but if you create a pattern you

00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:30,020
can then how I skip some oh I didn't

00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:31,880
yeah this one is if you play at Apple it

00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:36,440
will play all times at the same time and

00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:37,820
you can make some math with it where

00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,480
it's not just this boring one you can

00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:40,480
also have a bass

00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:58,399
or some drums yeah okay I'm racing here

00:26:55,259 --> 00:27:01,980
my heart as the previous talk was saying

00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:06,749
okay I set some scale and some stuff

00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:08,500
here I created some notes so this is a

00:27:06,749 --> 00:27:11,710
baseline

00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:14,700
it kind of might make some sense but

00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:17,440
also we don't have the right amount of

00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:20,370
silence because music is not just about

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:29,350
sounds but also the space of the silence

00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:35,080
so not yet I also have some chords which

00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:39,150
I will stop and I also have some bit and

00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:39,150
then now I can play everything together

00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:51,520
what is it supposed to play oh yeah I

00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:53,540
always do this mistake you might know

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,920
this one

00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,920
[Music]

00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:05,059
so you guys noticed right and this is my

00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:07,770
sock from Pike on Caesar 2017 I have

00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:14,690

the moment Mara is going to give the

00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:06,380
next talk he doesn't need any

00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:11,570
preparation and he set up but could we

00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:13,429
have the conference speakers who have

00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:15,620
their presentation on the Google Drive

00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:18,889
just up at the side of the stage please

00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:20,360
ready to talk next thank you take it

00:30:18,889 --> 00:30:30,080

00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:31,490
trap please hi my name is Marisa Givi

00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,889
and this is how my keyboard looks like

00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:35,870
two years ago exactly this place like

00:30:33,889 --> 00:30:36,799
600 kilometres to the south in Rimini I

00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:40,070
stood at this place

00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:41,330
and I tried to persuade it to tell you a

00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:43,429
little bit about the keyboard layout

00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:46,100
that I am using anybody else using the

00:30:43,429 --> 00:30:47,149
same keyboard layout no no because I

00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,559
have looked over your shoulders today

00:30:47,149 --> 00:30:50,570
and I've seen you have learned nothing

00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,130
so this is the US standard keyboard

00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:53,960
layout which is perfect if you want to

00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:56,330
program in Python or you want to write

00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:59,029

00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:07,940

00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:08,809
have a little a very cultured a bit not

00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:10,340
electric noctis's ever and we are only

00:33:08,809 --> 00:33:11,779
scratch the surface so imagine that

00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:14,299
everyday you type in a few European

00:33:11,779 --> 00:33:15,679
languages and look like how your

00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:17,360
keyboard and your brain has to look like

00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,130
because you have to switch between all

00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,370
these keyboard layouts you know it you

00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,370
remember

00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:28,679
with which problems with international

00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:30,830
keyboards they all will have we can

00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:33,960
switch with using a character maps and

00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:35,700
copy-paste some characters this doesn't

00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,270
work very well if you want to type

00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,280
fluently

00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:40,140
but fortunately in the 70s and 80s on

00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:42,809
the keyboards there was a compost ki a

00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:44,520
compost ki means that I just type

00:33:42,809 --> 00:33:46,980
compost and then to other characters and

00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:49,470
in a combination it will in return give

00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:51,000
return a new character that with all the

00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:53,250
special characters that need in other

00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,870
European languages and it works in

00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:57,120
German French all the languages that we

00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:59,220
have seen until now how it works it is

00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,500
actually already in your system in that

00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:02,910
file you have over 6000 Alliance with

00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,040
all the combinations that you can have a

00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:06,630
look at if it is not enough and you want

00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,760
to types in some obscure languages or

00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:12,179
emojis you can always define in the same

00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:13,560
way your ex compose file and your

00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:16,050
keyboard doesn't have this compose key

00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,580
so you need one you can define some key

00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:19,740
that you don't use every day so like the

00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:21,210
art right window or print screen or

00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:23,850
something like that everything you have

00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:25,409
to do set xkb map option compose and for

00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:27,149
example menu and then you can use it as

00:34:25,409 --> 00:34:28,320
a compost key there's not I'm still

00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:29,970
already standing here we are going to

00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:33,929
heck another key which one is it

00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:36,780
yes it's caps lock we can make a control

00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:39,000
of out of it because it's just left from

00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:40,889
the a and our pinkie key is very common

00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,990
because very convenient if you want to

00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:45,869
we type control which is usually very

00:34:42,990 --> 00:34:47,340
far away what we do is just say our caps

00:34:45,869 --> 00:34:48,960
lock is Contra modifier but it's not

00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:51,389
everything let's do something more with

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,770
it because our caps lock can take

00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:54,270
functions of two keys it can be

00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:56,220
controlled and it can be escaped because

00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:58,890
control you usually print press and

00:34:56,220 --> 00:35:00,630
compare combine it with other key escape

00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:02,880
you just hit it press it and release it

00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:05,400
immediately so we install xscape and

00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:09,150
then your caps lock will work as both

00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:10,980
keyboard layouts I mean the most keys at

00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:12,930
the same time then you put some nice

00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:15,080
stickers and you're done thank you very

00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:15,080
much

00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:21,580
how long do you project how long they're

00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:30,360
be careful talk

00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:33,100
a year so um yeah so anybody want to

00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:36,670
want me to continue the sausage story um

00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:40,150
so yeah sorry you're forced to listen to

00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:42,460
my on my sauce a story like no but yeah

00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:44,140
so last year when we went to Germany the

00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:46,990
first time when Germany was going to

00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:49,300
Hamburg and then I was like yes German

00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:51,220
sausages so basically what happened is

00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:54,730
like when I wake up I'll look for a

00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:57,040
place that I could have sausage and and

00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:59,290
then so the whole day would be like

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,960
finding places so I can have sausage and

00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:04,240
then at the end I would go to like

00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,770
because I had near my hotel there's like

00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,320
a little store that they sell sausages

00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:11,410
so I would have sausage from breakfast

00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:14,110
to - after like drunk food will be

00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:16,780
sausage so um yeah but like but yeah

00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:19,890
also I and now I try different things

00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:24,090
not just sausage like schnitzel and

00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:32,140
pistols and yeah so I like I like food

00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:34,150
yeah yeah so yes some other things what

00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:38,040
should I talk about not sausage maybe oh

00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:38,040
I don't have to talk about anything good

00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:53,059
I think it changed to resolution hello

00:36:50,749 --> 00:37:03,950
yeah what did the farmer say when he

00:36:53,059 --> 00:37:06,220
lost his tractor where's my tractor okay

00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:06,220
go ahead

00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:17,059
how do you think what will happen if you

00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:19,880
will end up in Berlin and you are a lady

00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:23,319
and you are software developer feyten

00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:25,220
developer the problem is here that

00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:27,619
probably you will start looking for

00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:30,289
friends if you are alone then you will

00:37:27,619 --> 00:37:32,029
probably go to the meetup page looking

00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:34,670
for some communities and they are

00:37:32,029 --> 00:37:37,130
welcoming they're open and nice and I

00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:40,069
found some communities which I was

00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:43,220
interested in but I end up being asked

00:37:40,069 --> 00:37:46,999
if I'm not a software developer for sure

00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:48,950
if I'm an HR because I'm a lady the

00:37:46,999 --> 00:37:52,549
problem is here that I was like confused

00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:55,400
I'm a developer and then some other girl

00:37:52,549 --> 00:37:57,559
because we were apparently just 2 in the

00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:59,749
whole community in the whole Meetup and

00:37:57,559 --> 00:38:01,640
that's why we were recognized as not

00:37:59,749 --> 00:38:05,839
software developers because we are known

00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:08,480
many people so the other girl she

00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:10,849
approached me and said wow hi nice to

00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:14,529
meet you I'm so happy we can talk about

00:38:10,849 --> 00:38:18,049
software now that was embarrassing

00:38:14,529 --> 00:38:20,269
yeah so then I found out about bye

00:38:18,049 --> 00:38:20,809
ladies and then it was very nice

00:38:20,269 --> 00:38:23,900
community

00:38:20,809 --> 00:38:26,900
everyone was so open and all the ideas

00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:29,329
were appreciated I could speak as I'm a

00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:32,739
girl and software developer I could be

00:38:29,329 --> 00:38:35,660
myself but I was like in some kind of

00:38:32,739 --> 00:38:39,589
exchange of ideas with different people

00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:41,779
and we have different thinking all of us

00:38:39,589 --> 00:38:43,970
it doesn't matter if you are a man or a

00:38:41,779 --> 00:38:47,869
woman we have different ideas and that's

00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:50,839
great and to be honest you have to

00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:52,940
follow those rules in reality you look

00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:55,130
like a girl you act like a lady you

00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:58,160
think like a man and then you work like

00:38:55,130 --> 00:39:00,589
a boss and here comes the truth

00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:03,259
I want to be myself I want to be a lady

00:39:00,589 --> 00:39:08,509
a girl a woman I don't want to be a man

00:39:03,259 --> 00:39:10,369
in any kind of stories so the idea was

00:39:08,509 --> 00:39:13,730
to find out the community with all the

00:39:10,369 --> 00:39:16,759
support being friendly open and being

00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:18,980
inclusive and open-minded and to be a

00:39:16,759 --> 00:39:22,009
safe environment for everyone so then

00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:23,869
ladies would be happy to come and share

00:39:22,009 --> 00:39:26,119
ideas and they are not going to be asked

00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:29,960
if they are non software developers but

00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:31,309
hrs and here is the answer here is the

00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:35,779
community and one of the organizers

00:39:31,309 --> 00:39:39,140
together with a few more people we are

00:39:35,779 --> 00:39:41,720
open-minded and we have at least 30% of

00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:44,500
ladies in our communities and they feel

00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,500
safe there

00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:56,420
we are based in Berlin and we know how

00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:59,740
to get on the top of the TV tower in

00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:03,440
Berlin with peyten

00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:05,590
so that's how we have we had all the

00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:09,710
events we're different we have different

00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:13,370
kind of formats

00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:16,690
it's like lighting talks as well and 30

00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:19,460
minutes talks and also panels where it's

00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:22,520
like open questions you can ask whatever

00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:25,250
you would like to know we started

00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:27,440
recently in February this year and every

00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:30,320
time we have new people is around like

00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,540
70 new people every meetup I was

00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:35,510
surprised how many developers are in

00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:37,340
Berlin especially in Python and usually

00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:40,330
we organize some events together with

00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:43,070
pilotis to be supportive and open and

00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:48,290
the next meetup is going to be on the

00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:51,230

we don't have too much time we've got

00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:18,339

thanks very much to them really pleased

00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:22,930
about that

00:43:20,589 --> 00:43:26,309
we need more sponsors because we need

00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:29,049
more funds especially for our financial

00:43:26,309 --> 00:43:31,029
assistance just to give you an idea

00:43:29,049 --> 00:43:34,059
about how people travel they'll be

00:43:31,029 --> 00:43:36,390
taking an 11 10 or 11-hour bus journey

00:43:34,059 --> 00:43:41,829
from Lagos to Accra and back again

00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:44,740
together from the Nigerian community can

00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:46,960
you help us with sponsorship we'd love

00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:48,190
some more money specifically for

00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:52,030
financial assistance

00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:54,820

00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:57,100
have a GoFundMe page so please take a

00:43:54,820 --> 00:44:00,190
photo of that if you can contribute a

00:43:57,100 --> 00:44:02,770
little bit of money to that it will help

00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:05,680
someone because some of the costs are

00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:07,300
relatively very low others such as

00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:10,270
travel are higher but every little bit

00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:12,970
will help we need an extra six thousand

00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:15,250
or so euros in order to cover all the

00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:19,240
financial assistance needs that we want

00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:21,730

00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:51,810
when it turns into a barn okay here we

00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:54,660
are so I think many of you have heard

00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:57,440
about Pike on D there has been eight

00:46:54,660 --> 00:47:01,530
Trikke on the east so far and I think

00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:04,260
you've probably also heard about PI data

00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:10,110
berlin and i think they started in 2014

00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:12,510
right and what happens if you bring like

00:47:10,110 --> 00:47:15,120
two good things together one even bigger

00:47:12,510 --> 00:47:18,210
great thing so actually we talked and we

00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:21,540
decided it's not only the time to make

00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:22,980
specializing in conferences so far to

00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:25,410
bring communities back together again

00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:28,170
like here the - and the data science

00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:30,750
communities so yeah we have the

00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:33,090
conference and up to a in October it

00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:35,460
cost most billion I want to give you

00:47:33,090 --> 00:47:39,930
some facts about our proceedings so far

00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:43,320
so we had a CFP already it's closed with

00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:45,780
sorry um we had like 450 submissions

00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:49,410
which is in a way like yeah oh my god

00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:51,750
and yeah so actually since this was like

00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:54,150
as many submissions we basically with

00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:57,780
the help of author like we were happy to

00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:59,610
get to a community voting yeah so we had

00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:00,990
like thirty three thousand votes on the

00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:03,600
community working with help us

00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:06,420
recreating the program of this

00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:09,240
conference major sponsorship is already

00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:11,700
sold out sorry but we have diversity

00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:14,160
sponsorships still available and silver

00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:17,910
sponsors we will offer free child care

00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:19,410
and also like two-thirds of the tickets

00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:21,690
are gone already

00:48:19,410 --> 00:48:22,950
so oh this is like it's really nice I

00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:26,010
think it's really nice to have these

00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:28,680
communities working together also we

00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:30,480
decided this also like to save some

00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:32,850
resources on the community side because

00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:37,830
running a big conference is a lot of

00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:39,510
work and so yeah see you on the leg not

00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:42,360
all of you because we don't have enough

00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:55,710
tickets for everyone who laughs sorry

00:48:42,360 --> 00:49:00,300
oh no there's not more more that's now

00:48:55,710 --> 00:49:02,310
the ruffle coming down it doesn't okay

00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:04,290
very good so I'm already basically set

00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:06,740
up though because we have some giveaways

00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:09,810
and it was really challenging to think

00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:11,610
how can we distribute giveaways in a

00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:15,270
really fair matter so we thought about

00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:17,220
let's have a little raffle game so we

00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:19,170
just made this up so how is this is

00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:21,810
going to hold how does it going to work

00:49:19,170 --> 00:49:24,510
we have PI Cassandra hi Cassandra will

00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:27,300
ask you a question if you can answer

00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:30,030
this question will the clear yes please

00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:33,360
stand up and then we will narrow it down

00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:37,920
and hopefully until there's one person

00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:39,870
left standing so okay yeah it Stewart

00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:43,470
this is really easy you get into it so

00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:45,690
okay let's ask hi Cassandra stand up if

00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:59,610
you ever contributed to an open-source

00:49:45,690 --> 00:50:05,750
project so the next question is keep

00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:11,430
standing if the day of your birth is odd

00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:13,110
odd the date of your birth is off okay

00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:17,820
should have left okay

00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:20,510
keep standing if you traveled less than

00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:24,860
approximately oh wow eleven hundred

00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:24,860
meters to come here okay

00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:31,500
keep standing if your first name

00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:39,780
contains upper or lower case it doesn't

00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:42,540
matter the letter see how many people

00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:45,840
are standing like okay okay keep

00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:48,210
standing if your birthday contains the

00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:53,700
number so the full birthday day month

00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:55,800
and year and we have zero padded days

00:50:53,700 --> 00:51:04,520
and months so just like

00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:11,090
so and okay let's go nine everyone okay

00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:13,320
okay okay so okay okay so actually so I

00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:14,760
know it's run again it's time for a

00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:16,920
recursion the recursion recursion

00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:26,960
Jupiter notebooks is really easy to just

00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:32,120
go up the slide again so keep okay okay

00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:32,120
okay skip we skip this one contradiction

00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:40,020
yeah water jetted oh okay

00:51:37,890 --> 00:51:43,830
and that's basically also in a way a

00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:51,750
country let's skip that okay now with

00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:54,090
the names as oh we have a winner - yeah

00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:56,360
but we have a free yeah but we're 40

00:51:54,090 --> 00:51:56,360
bucks

00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:13,550
[Music]

00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:17,000
so I'm blindly and yeah and we have a

00:52:13,550 --> 00:52:17,000
book on flask

00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:28,500
[Applause]

00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:37,939
[Applause]

00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:07,040
[Applause]

00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:15,940
[Music]

00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:29,870
[Music]

00:53:36,510 --> 00:53:39,649
[Music]

00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:54,659
[Applause]

00:53:54,990 --> 00:54:06,580
okay we have more books later so I've

00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:07,840
been walking around the conference and

00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:09,640
there's obviously lots of groups of

00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:11,290
people anybody who is here this morning

00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:13,359
for the introduction will know that

00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:15,700
there's a lot of new people new faces

00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:17,320
here to Europe - and this can be a

00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:19,630
slightly overwhelming environment

00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:20,710
there's 1,200 people here and if you

00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:22,300
come here and you don't know anybody

00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:24,609
that can be kind of intimidating and

00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:26,170
there's a really simple thing you can do

00:54:24,609 --> 00:54:27,520
everyone in this room can do to make

00:54:26,170 --> 00:54:29,470
life easier for the people who are

00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:32,050
trying to make new friends and it is not

00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:33,609
to stand in circles there's a thing

00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:35,230
called the pac-man rule which is

00:54:33,609 --> 00:54:37,060
recommended at quite few conferences now

00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:39,160
and the idea is if you're standing with

00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:41,560
a group of people you know leave a gap

00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:43,390
just a gap for one person and then if

00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:44,950
somebody comes in and joins you then you

00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:46,900
somebody steps apart again to make

00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:49,240
another gap and this way you make your

00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:51,940
conversations welcoming for other people

00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:57,580
to join you hey you do you not have

00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:59,290
slides oh sorry sorry I'm I'm gonna

00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:02,440
offer more advice in a moment but if you

00:54:59,290 --> 00:55:06,070
would like to start your talk hi

00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:08,560
everyone so the topic of my lightning

00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:11,470
talk is is that the pison t-shirt you

are wearing and if you love your job

00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:15,970

minutes checking the events in Basel

00:55:15,970 --> 00:55:19,390

00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:21,369

Concord in Germany a few months ago and

00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:33,970
when I was coming back I was talking to

00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:35,710
a few women you know like socialize and

00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:37,810

stressful it can be okay it can be

whatever but not fun why some people say

00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:57,760
that it's weird and this the other one

00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:59,740
confirmed and said yeah true it cannot

00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,720
be fun and everything inside me was

00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:03,430
screaming like that's wrong it's just so

00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:07,180
wrong and that's why I'm giving this

00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:09,190
talk because I had this feelings my job

00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:11,620
is fun and it always been fun and I do

00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:12,790
data analysis in pison and I really

00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:14,320
enjoy what I do and I'm really

00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:16,120
passionate about what I do and it's my

00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:18,100
hobby and honestly I would be doing it

00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:19,570
for free just don't tell my boss because

00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:23,080
you know it's not good if your boss

00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:24,580
knows that yeah yeah and it's just so

00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:26,590
crazy how many people are never

00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:28,180
questioning like if they enjoy what they

00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:30,730
do you know you don't have many lives

00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:32,590
like question yourself ask yourself like

00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:34,900
am i happy with my work am i happy with

00:56:32,590 --> 00:56:36,940
my life I think these questions are

00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:40,480
really important and because as I always

00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:44,320
say if tomorrow I'm 85 and I look at my

00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:46,540
life back and I ask myself like it's

00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:48,130
data analysis in Python something I mean

00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:50,140
I'm happy doing all my life like the

00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:51,580
answer is yes it is definitely yes and I

00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:53,200
don't need time thinking about it and

00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:54,580
that's I think questions which people

00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:58,240
should ask themself because if they

00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:59,710
don't you run you might run away from it

00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,450
you know ma'am you might avoid asking

00:56:59,710 --> 00:57:03,970
this question because you're afraid to

00:57:01,450 --> 00:57:05,860
confront yourself and like answer yes I

00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:07,600
am unhappy where I am I'm I'm unhappy

00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:09,520
with my job because as in informatics

00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:12,250
you have so many opportunities there are

00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:13,990
so many fields and so many bosses and

00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:15,790
companies like everywhere so you don't

00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:18,220
have to be stuck with something you you

00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:20,410
you hate and the purpose of my talk is

00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:22,060
the message yeah explore talk to people

00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:23,320
question if you like what you're doing

00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:25,240
because at the end is better for

00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:27,400
everyone it's better for you you feel

00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:29,110
great you feel happy and it's better for

00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:31,060
your boss because you do great job and

00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:32,410
it's better for the company and it's

00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:33,940
better for your friends because they

00:57:32,410 --> 00:57:34,780
don't have to listen to you complaining

00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:38,320
to them every day

00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:40,450
and I have people I know people who go

00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:42,370
to work complain about their wives and

00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:45,100
then go to their wives and complain

00:57:42,370 --> 00:57:47,230
about their job so don't be that don't

00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:49,180
become that like if it's too late just

00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:51,640
try to change something as much as you

00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:55,540
can any of you already if you like just

00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:58,090
don't be that kind of person so yeah

00:57:55,540 --> 00:58:00,730
when I when my colleagues are making fun

00:57:58,090 --> 00:58:02,350

you have Python bracelet you have bison

00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:10,210
stickers that's weird you're nerd I'm

00:58:08,020 --> 00:58:13,620
just thinking you're just jealous that

00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:13,620
you don't like what you're doing

00:58:14,070 --> 00:58:18,390
fantastic advice there

00:58:27,339 --> 00:58:36,919
let's see give you a quick whoa

00:58:31,819 --> 00:58:48,120
it's outside I hope so I have to go to

00:58:36,919 --> 00:58:51,889
Munich I've run out of tractor jokes

00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:51,889
[Music]

00:58:52,599 --> 00:59:05,059
maybe yeah I have a Windows 7 jerk wish

00:59:01,849 --> 00:59:06,619
oh yeah if you have met me last year you

00:59:05,059 --> 00:59:10,929
know that actually I think that was my

00:59:06,619 --> 00:59:10,929
first lightning talk of all windows 7 oh

00:59:18,009 --> 00:59:24,849
is it really ready oh no it doesn't work

00:59:21,199 --> 00:59:24,849
yeah all right

00:59:31,590 --> 00:59:36,660
I'm ready yes let's go

00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:44,080
life is either a daring adventure or

00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:46,840
nothing and unfortunately we have just

00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:49,180
one life we often spend it like this in

00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:51,430
our office but sometimes we go to 80

00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:53,470
conferences don't get me wrong I totally

00:59:51,430 --> 00:59:54,850
love conferences and I'm also organizing

00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:58,540
them but I just believe there is way

00:59:54,850 --> 01:00:00,400
more potential as Donald Walsh says love

00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:02,440
begins at the edge of your comfort zone

01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:05,530
so I decided to kick myself out of there

01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:07,600
and I went to buy this vni conference on

01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:09,490
a motorcycle I decided to avoid the

01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:11,170
highway to see the real scenery and it

01:00:09,490 --> 01:00:13,630
was a beautiful scenery indeed but it

01:00:11,170 --> 01:00:15,190
was still quite comfortable I had just

01:00:13,630 --> 01:00:18,190
to wait for a couple of hours until I

01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:21,070
met a thunderstorm yeah that's a real

01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:24,220
picture I got so wet my phone got wet it

01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:26,590
turned off I had no GPS I was running

01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:28,240
out of gas and I start to panic but then

01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:30,040
I thought isn't that exactly what you've

01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:31,740
been looking for out of the comfort zone

01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:34,540
it's an adventure

01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:36,430
next was ficon san sebastian i did the

01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:38,740
same except this time it was three and a

01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:40,660
half thousand kilometers wonderful

01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:43,030
scenery I met wonderful people that I

01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:46,060
also met Leslie Leslie is a hurricane

01:00:43,030 --> 01:00:48,460
that hit France and Spain exactly a day

01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:50,980
after the conference fortunately it was

01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:52,780
just on the coast mostly so I managed to

01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:55,000
escape and I got some skills and not

01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:57,310
getting wet thanks to the plastic bags

01:00:55,000 --> 01:01:00,010
and stuff like that and I got totally

01:00:57,310 --> 01:01:02,050
addicted to adventure matter so next was

01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:04,720
FICO Natalia and what could possibly go

01:01:02,050 --> 01:01:06,910
wrong such a wonderful weather mountains

01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:11,410
ha ha 5 days later you will not believe

01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:13,420
that snow wind what the hell I really

01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:15,070
had to take this picture with the

01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:16,720
conference batch because nobody believed

01:01:15,070 --> 01:01:19,630
in my skills of attracting the trouble

01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:22,650
and my skills of avoiding getting wet

01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:26,440
were even even better this time

01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:27,880
so next here we go Europe Eisen I made a

01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:30,160
poll on Twitter what's the most elegant

01:01:27,880 --> 01:01:32,200
way to get here and motorcycle was not

01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:34,570
winning train was winning and the

01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:36,520
bicycle was winning so why not I took a

01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:39,010
train to Paris and I decided to cycle to

01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:40,660
here and then to Munich and that get

01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:42,040
ruled by this picture I look happy

01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:43,840
because it's just the beginning

01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:46,330
it was not so

01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:48,160
easy it was not easy at all imagine in

01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:50,770
the middle of nowhere you remember the

01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:52,540
weather it was so hot without water

01:01:50,770 --> 01:01:54,580
without the signal on your phone you

01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:56,410
have to fix your wheel again and again

01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:58,330
and I have five patches just on the

01:01:56,410 --> 01:02:00,910
front wheel till I got to here now but

01:01:58,330 --> 01:02:03,130
the scenery the scenery was totally

01:02:00,910 --> 01:02:05,920
worth it I mean you cannot get that

01:02:03,130 --> 01:02:07,540
without going through that challenge it

01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:10,150
was right like running a marathon but

01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:12,070
every day and when I crossed this sign

01:02:10,150 --> 01:02:13,960
yesterday evening you can imagine my

01:02:12,070 --> 01:02:14,680
emotions how cool it was and how cool it

01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:16,540
is right now

01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:23,290
to be here and speak in front of you so

01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:25,510
thanks for having me the only one who is

01:02:23,290 --> 01:02:28,150
doing these things my friend Stephan

01:02:25,510 --> 01:02:29,650
Benilde whom you perhaps know was taking

01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:31,570
a wonderful training journey on last

01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:33,100
Europe Python I'm trying to convince him

01:02:31,570 --> 01:02:35,620
to give a lightning talk tomorrow so I

01:02:33,100 --> 01:02:38,050
hope it works he also has his ways and

01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:39,850
he lives cycling as well and last but

01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:42,040
not least while speaking about all this

01:02:39,850 --> 01:02:45,160
fun of travel we should not forget that

01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:47,460
not everyone can ride a motorcycle and

01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:49,660
not everyone can ride a bicycle and

01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:52,210
actually not everyone can even walk

01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:54,640
right we should not exclude these people

01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:56,500
and my last story really quick one will

01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:59,260
be about a friend of mine from Ukraine

01:02:56,500 --> 01:03:01,870
and his childhood friend Yuri Yuri has a

01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:05,110
cerebral palsy he cannot move at all yet

01:03:01,870 --> 01:03:08,230
his dream was singing mountains even

01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:10,150
from the train window time passed he

01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:12,370
began he grew up and he never forgot

01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:15,520
about his friend's dream so once he met

01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:17,200
a paragliding manufacturer he asked them

01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:19,540
if they could maybe make sense they do

01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:21,730
backpacks if they could make some sort

01:03:19,540 --> 01:03:24,610
of device that could help him carrying a

01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:27,060
very difficult very very heavy object

01:03:24,610 --> 01:03:29,800
which was his friends and they made it

01:03:27,060 --> 01:03:32,230
with a lot of practice with a lot of

01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:34,060
training time past he came back to his

01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:35,830
friend in Ukraine and he said well

01:03:34,060 --> 01:03:37,990
that's the day we should make a dream

01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:39,580
come true we are not just going to

01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:43,290
mountains we are climbing the highest

01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:46,600
mountain of Ukraine and here they go

01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:48,700
isn't that beautiful he made it through

01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:52,730
a lot of pain and suffering he made it

01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:56,660
and imagines the emotion that moment

01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:59,450
and why I'm showing this really my

01:03:56,660 --> 01:04:03,260
bicycle trip is nothing comparing to

01:03:59,450 --> 01:04:05,630
this honestly so I'm not special anyhow

01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:08,000
and there are so many people in this

01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:11,150
world who do this daring cool things and

01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:14,000
so can you so I just want to encourage

01:04:11,150 --> 01:04:16,400
you to give it a try to go crazy go

01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,079
daring and just remember we're all the

01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:21,190
community and we should help each other

01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:21,190
thank you very much

01:04:27,290 --> 01:04:33,170
okay so we've already run 13 minutes

01:04:31,220 --> 01:04:34,910
over time we have time for one last

01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:37,280
lightning talk this evening

01:04:34,910 --> 01:04:38,540
so we'll be clearing the slate tomorrow

01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,200
morning so if you were on the end of

01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:41,540
this list

01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:46,790
coming early tomorrow and get on the top

01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:47,570
of tomorrow's list and that was perfect

01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:51,440
timing

01:04:47,570 --> 01:04:54,400
take it away hi so I'm Alex I will be

01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:57,920

black there should be more hands so one

01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:07,190
day I was showcasing black to a friend

01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:09,860
of mine it is sort of like okay I will

01:05:07,190 --> 01:05:11,870
add some more parenthesis to the print

01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:14,900
statement and it will show how black

01:05:11,870 --> 01:05:18,560
removes them Yammer know I've got an

01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:20,570
error message so that got me thinking

01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:25,340
okay black has some internal safeguards

01:05:20,570 --> 01:05:27,410
like the formatting state should be an

01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:29,840
important like applying the formatting

01:05:27,410 --> 01:05:32,810
twice should give you the same results

01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:35,750
or the code after formatting should give

01:05:32,810 --> 01:05:39,230
the same abstract syntax tree so the

01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:42,890
idea was born generate some source code

01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:45,950
run black on it rinse and repeat until

01:05:42,890 --> 01:05:49,180
black finds a bug in itself so there is

01:05:45,950 --> 01:05:52,580
a testing package called hypothesis

01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:54,820
which can do almost all that for you but

01:05:52,580 --> 01:05:57,470
you need still need to write some

01:05:54,820 --> 01:06:00,140
hypotheses strategy to generate the

01:05:57,470 --> 01:06:04,420
source code I'm a lazy programmer so I

01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:10,580
thought about another tool called AFL

01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:15,350
that implements fuzzing and what fuzzing

01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:18,170
is is you give fuzzing tool an input

01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:21,140
file or a set of input files it runs

01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:23,600
them through you code with coverage

01:06:21,140 --> 01:06:25,820
enabled then change the beat in the

01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:30,170
input runs it again again and again

01:06:25,820 --> 01:06:32,590
until it finds a bug or until it expands

01:06:30,170 --> 01:06:37,580
its coverage so it can basically

01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:40,579
generate new ways new paths through your

01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:43,609
code but the problem with AFL is that

01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:46,400
it's generally made for binary file

01:06:43,609 --> 01:06:49,039
formats like compressed files image

01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:52,099
files executable files we're changing

01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:55,339
only a small bit or a byte will change

01:06:52,099 --> 01:06:58,579
the picture drastically Python source

01:06:55,339 --> 01:07:00,439
code changing one byte will give you

01:06:58,579 --> 01:07:02,479
just different variable name or

01:07:00,439 --> 01:07:06,170
different function call that's not fun

01:07:02,479 --> 01:07:08,089
so what I did I've went to the Python

01:07:06,170 --> 01:07:10,729
source code I got the person grammar

01:07:08,089 --> 01:07:13,339
I've got all the key words or the

01:07:10,729 --> 01:07:17,539
punctuation marks from it generated a

01:07:13,339 --> 01:07:22,009
set of strings buzzing engine could

01:07:17,539 --> 01:07:23,150
inject into my source code and gave it

01:07:22,009 --> 01:07:27,339
to sick father

01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:30,729
in the end after almost two weeks

01:07:27,339 --> 01:07:35,269
running buzzing on my laptop when I

01:07:30,729 --> 01:07:38,449
didn't forget to open the lead it gave

01:07:35,269 --> 01:07:40,549
me four bucks in black said I've

01:07:38,449 --> 01:07:43,910
reported and there's way more about

01:07:40,549 --> 01:07:47,989
fuzzing you can minimize your test cases

01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:51,650
you can get you your whole corpus of

01:07:47,989 --> 01:07:56,719
your test cases like all the files and

01:07:51,650 --> 01:08:00,499
select only those which gives you enough

01:07:56,719 --> 01:08:02,299
coverage like a subset of test cases

01:08:00,499 --> 01:08:05,749
that gives you the same coverage and

01:08:02,299 --> 01:08:07,999
there's a very cool book about fuzzing

01:08:05,749 --> 01:08:09,949
and Python as free online book at

01:08:07,999 --> 01:08:13,640
fuzzing book dot org if you are

01:08:09,949 --> 01:08:15,949
interested in fuzzing check it and I've

01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:18,409
put slides online and source code I've

01:08:15,949 --> 01:08:21,550
used online so you can try fuzzing

01:08:18,409 --> 01:08:27,409
yourself that's it

01:08:21,550 --> 01:08:29,089
[Applause]

01:08:27,409 --> 01:08:30,349
if you'd like to just stay seated for

01:08:29,089 --> 01:08:35,449
one more moment there's going to be an

01:08:30,349 --> 01:08:40,929
announcement for call for going to call

01:08:35,449 --> 01:08:45,099
to action so if you if any one wants a

01:08:40,929 --> 01:08:49,690
cool yellow t-shirt from your Python

01:08:45,099 --> 01:08:52,549
there's still well except the obvious

01:08:49,690 --> 01:08:54,730
you can sign up for a chair tomorrow if

01:08:52,549 --> 01:08:59,029
you want so like we have two more spots

01:08:54,730 --> 01:09:03,109
free well free for session chair

01:08:59,029 --> 01:09:07,159
tomorrow so basically we need people who

01:09:03,109 --> 01:09:09,349
will present the speakers and show them

01:09:07,159 --> 01:09:12,889
you have ten minutes more and things

01:09:09,349 --> 01:09:16,339
like that so come and talk to me if you

01:09:12,889 --> 01:09:17,989
want to volunteer Thanks do it that's a

01:09:16,339 --> 01:09:19,279
great way to meet new people this is all

01:09:17,989 --> 01:09:21,319
about becoming part of the community

01:09:19,279 --> 01:09:22,759
meeting new people can I have a big

01:09:21,319 --> 01:09:25,719
round of applause for all our Lightning

01:09:22,759 --> 01:09:25,719
talks because this evening

01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:28,859
