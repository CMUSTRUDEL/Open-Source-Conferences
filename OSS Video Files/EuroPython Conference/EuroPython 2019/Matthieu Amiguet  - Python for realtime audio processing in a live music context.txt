By Matthieu Amiguet 

At Les Chemins de Traverse we explore ways of ""augmenting"" acoustical musical instruments with new sonic possibilities offered by computers. For doing so, we need ultra-low latency real-time audio processing programs. Pretty much the typical situation where python should emnot/em be used, right? Wrong. As it happens, that's exactly what we've been doing for the past few years.

Building on Olivier Belanger's wonderful pyo module and (ab)using python's flexibility, we developed custom software to allow us to express our musical ideas.

If you want to hear how it sounds, you should go to Europython's social event that will feature a gig based on python-augmented (!) instruments. And if you want to know how we came to use python in this context and how we do it, you should come to this talk!
