By Christian Barra

Infarm is a FaaS, Farming as a Service, and whether you believe it or not, our business is in-house farming at scale.

We design and build our farms, grow vegetables and sell them, and the backbone of our infrastructure is based on Python.

You can check this video to see what we do - https://twitter.com/christianbarra/status/1096399602159439874

More than 10 million observations are recorded from our farms, feeding our farm management system that allows operators, plant scientists, and supervisors to monitor each farm in real-time.

During this talk I will briefly introduce the world's problems we are trying to resolve at Infarm and then talk about our IoT farms, infrastructure, how we use Python and how we plan to improve the capabilities of our farms by adding edge machine learning.

Agenda


What are the problems we are trying to solve at Infarm
Our 4 tech pillars
How we started with Python
Issues we are facing while scaling our Python infrastructure to support &gt; 400 farms
How we plan to evolve our software and infrastructure on 4 different levels: consolidate, architecture, cloud native and observability
How Python is going to support our automated farms and its role in making the farms smarter (edge computing with AI)
