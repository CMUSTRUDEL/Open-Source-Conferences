By Christian Barra

Infarm is a FaaS, Farming as a Service, and whether you believe it or not, our business is in-house farming at scale.

We design and build our farms, grow vegetables and sell them, and the backbone of our infrastructure is based on Python.

You can check this video to see what we do - https://twitter.com/christianbarra/status/1096399602159439874

More than 10 million observations are recorded from our farms, feeding our farm management system that allows operators, plant scientists, and supervisors to monitor each farm in real-time.

During this talk I will briefly introduce the world's problems we are trying to resolve at Infarm and then talk about our IoT farms, infrastructure, how we use Python and how we plan to improve the capabilities of our farms by adding edge machine learning.

Agenda


What are the problems we are trying to solve at Infarm
Our 4 tech pillars
How we started with Python
Issues we are facing while scaling our Python infrastructure to support &gt; 400 farms
How we plan to evolve our software and infrastructure on 4 different levels: consolidate, architecture, cloud native and observability
How Python is going to support our automated farms and its role in making the farms smarter (edge computing with AI)

	00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:11,170
so hello my name is Christian and I'm so

00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:12,219
happy to be here this like my fort or my

00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,809
50 year Python

00:00:12,219 --> 00:00:15,400
oh it's attending your Python for the

00:00:13,809 --> 00:00:18,030
first time raise your hand

00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:23,650
that's a lot well welcome to your vitam

00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:29,560
oh is also vegetarian or vegan here okay

00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:34,570
we can do better so do you do you know

00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:36,550
this guy that's really famous so this

00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:38,260
guy is Marc Andreessen is a venture

00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,450
capitalist in San Francisco is one of

00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:42,220
the most famous one it's also the

00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:44,640
co-author of mosaic the first browser

00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:47,260
and it's also the co-founder of Netscape

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,910
and a couple of years ago we brought a

00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:51,640
really interesting article on The Wall

00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:55,690
Street Journal with the title why

00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:57,220
software is eating the world this is the

00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:59,260
blog post is the article on The Wall

00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:02,410
Street Journal is really interesting and

00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:05,019
the article try to explains why software

00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:07,750
is reshaping the world and also changing

00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:09,790
our lives at the same time but today I

00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:13,690
would like to take this sentence and

00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:16,240
rephrase it a bit so can software feed

00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:18,880
the world but before answering this

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:22,090
question I have another one why should

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:29,310
we bother so does anyone know today's

00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:33,960
words population chance sorry seven okay

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:35,170
it's seven point seven billion and by

00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,060
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,060
sorry 2015 Oh

00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,180
not twenty I mean that will be really a

00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:45,520
lot it's nine point eight billion this

00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:49,420
it's like the forecast from the United

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,990
Nation and nine point eight billion it's

00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:55,570
it's a huge number I mean it will put a

00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:59,530
lot of pressure on our ecosystem as a

00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:03,010
world and to feed the world population

00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:05,290
by 2050 we need to increase crops

00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:07,270
production by at least twenty five or

00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:09,659
seventy percent which is almost

00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,659
impossible

00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:14,319
but I mean that's not the only big

00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:17,379
change what about people living in urban

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,739
areas what part of the population is

00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:24,280
living in urban areas right now well

00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:28,810
that number today is 53 percent and also

00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:30,760
by 2050 it will reach a 68 percent so

00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:34,170
the majority of the poor population who

00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:36,610
live and the agglomerate in big cities

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,430
with more than I don't know ten millions

00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:41,260
people so if you do the math you see

00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:43,569
that they will be more than four billion

00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:45,370
people living in urban areas and the

00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:48,519
question is can we keep moving food

00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:53,980
around can we cou can we keep producing

00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:55,690
food far from the consumers so if we

00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,879
collect all these things together and we

00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,410
stop a second and we start thinking

00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:01,989
about the bigger picture

00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:06,940
we can easily realize that we have some

00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:09,310
big problems so first of all the growth

00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,959
of the poor population and also the

00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,819
migration towards urban areas are

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,030
creating problems and putting also

00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:18,069
constraints at the same time the first

00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:20,799
thing is yes we want to feed these

00:03:18,069 --> 00:03:22,750
people and we want to avoid hunger but

00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:26,319
it's it's almost impossible to convert

00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:28,720
more land to food production actually

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,430
would be counterproductive because of

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,440
the climate change for example and

00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,540
another thing that we need to consider

00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,849
is that people from developing countries

00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,769
are getting wheelchair which means they

00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:41,500
will have a diet which is more similar

00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:43,989
to our animal so the food consumption

00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:49,060
will increase and also change will

00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:50,410
evolve so what should we do we have

00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:54,280
problems we are an engineer and

00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:57,760
developers how do we fix them so many

00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:01,470
solution has been proposed but we can

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:05,440
summarize them in three main categories

00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:07,569
so the first one is I would like to

00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:10,870
invite you to change your diet because

00:04:07,569 --> 00:04:13,150
moving from a heavy red meat based diet

00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:16,690
to a more sustainable one is the first

00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:18,820
change we need to make and this will

00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,349
reduce croplands due to feed animals

00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,850
which is one of the biggest problem

00:04:20,349 --> 00:04:24,180
right now

00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:26,100
the second thing is that we should also

00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,720
reduce waste I will talk more about this

00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,750
later but just to give you a number

00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:35,150
between 35 and 50 percent of food is

00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:37,560
waste before it gets to our tables and

00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,700
the last thing that we can do is

00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,780
something that we can use is to use

00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:44,460
technology and we can use to acknowledge

00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,990
it for many things but for example we

00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,780
can use technology to increase crop

00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:53,340
yields or to rethink about agriculture

00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:55,650
and that's what we do getting from so

00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,810
what you see here is it's not a fridge

00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:01,110
it's not a container it's a farm it's a

00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:05,040
vertical farm and we grow food and we go

00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:06,690
food inside here in farm is is a fuss

00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,360
it's not function as a service is

00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:11,430
farming as a service as a company which

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,800
was funded by lean a couple of years ago

00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:16,080
and what do you see here like I said

00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,560
before it's a vertical farm and it's

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:22,380
inside our retailer this is Erica is the

00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,020
main retailer and and Germany and just

00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:29,270
to give you a number we produce about

00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:32,010
110 k plans every month just for Attica

00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:34,650
so the farm that you see here it's it's

00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:37,560
a long was a long process like a long

00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:39,510
haul so it probably took like more than

00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,170
two years devil like this comes up a

00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:45,390
farm and we can grow 35 different type

00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:47,070
of crops inside the farm locally so

00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:49,080
we're just working this way so we have

00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:54,540
production center closed in cities in

00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:55,920
this gates Billy we use your pesticides

00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:58,800
because we can control the environment

00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:03,810
and we have no seasons so we can produce

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:06,960
360 days and currently we operate about

00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:13,050
400 farms with the goal of which in 1000

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:14,730
by the end of the year just to give you

00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:17,220
this is like a short videos like 30

00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:20,370
seconds and it's like inside a forum so

00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:22,890
you can see the LED lights people are

00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:25,370
operating the farms they are also

00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,370
harvesting

00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:35,180
we do the same so their grocery shops

00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:38,320
and then you can take your fresh shirt

00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:41,870
directly from the point of sales and

00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:45,170
what you see here as it's a mass

00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:47,120
production firm this one and it's the

00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:50,420
one that we use and so inside our

00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,730
production centers so just to give you

00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:55,700
more context from the sitting face to

00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:58,010
DRS it takes about four weeks so in one

00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:02,180
month more or less we can grow almost

00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:05,360
everything and a farm is a really really

00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:07,370
complex living system that we want to

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:11,870
operate we want to control and also we

00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:14,900
want to monitor so what can we control

00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:18,020
inside a farm so we have different

00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:21,110
things we can control water hair control

00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:24,860
lights control also pH control which is

00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:26,570
fundamental and fertilizers and like I

00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,150
said before we need to do this a scale

00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:31,820
because we are operating about 400 farms

00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:33,410
with the goal of reaching 1,000 in

00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:36,560
multiplication because we are active in

00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:39,919
Germany Switzerland Luxembourg UK and

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,169
we're going to expand to a USA soon and

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:46,880
because this is a fighter conference yes

00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:50,150
what we use Viton so as a software team

00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,860
we have about four areas of focus we

00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:55,160
have what we call operation which is

00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:57,770
managing people doing their kind of

00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:00,740
operation on farms then we have farm

00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:02,300
control monitoring and alerting and the

00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:06,110
new one the last pillar is called dance

00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:09,680
quality so operation are all the

00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:14,150
activities related to seeding planting

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:18,190
harvesting maintenance and it's the

00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:18,190
labor-intensive part of managing a farm

00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:23,390
fart control is like I said er IOT

00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:26,060
device so we have a configuration that

00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:27,410
we need to apply to each form because we

00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,540
want to control different parameters

00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:32,240
side we want to control the lights we

00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,919
want to control the water level and a

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,810
collection of these parameters what we

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,710
call recipe so a recipe is something

00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:41,550
that we apply to a farm is

00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:43,560
of configuration and we use a provider

00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:46,110
that it's called particle and we

00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:49,339
communicate with their API and we send

00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:49,339
the configuration to the forums

00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:54,930
monitoring alerting it's really

00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,920
interesting a farm under the hood is a

00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:59,040
really complex

00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,930
iut system also expensive and we custom

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:05,220
to receive events and data coming from

00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:07,740
the farms so for example if there is no

00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,450
water that's the same huge problem is

00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,510
the pH too high that solves a big

00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:14,339
problem so monitoring and alerting is a

00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:19,850
fundamental part of our company right

00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:22,830
now we have like a monitoring room and

00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:25,350
we have this new pillar vertical plants

00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:27,270
quality and the idea is to use data

00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:32,910
science and artificial intelligence to

00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:35,070
increase crops quality and yield so now

00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:39,360
I want to talk a bit more about the past

00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:41,399
of in farm so when we started we thought

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,800
about building a product for home

00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:46,380
consumers so as a consumer you can buy

00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,970
our small farm and you can bring the

00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:50,880
farm to your place and you can just grow

00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:52,650
things inside your apartment but in the

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,630
last like 12 months the scope of the

00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:59,190
company changed completely so we had to

00:09:54,630 --> 00:10:01,770
be wood and from business to consumer we

00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:04,770
change it to business to business so the

00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:08,700
software that we built has had to change

00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:10,560
it as well so initially we had a really

00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,410
small team the software team was sliced

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:17,070
the five people we started with a flask

00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:19,380
application with a be monolith all the

00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:21,300
business logic related to operation farm

00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:24,589
control and monitoring and alerting

00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:28,440
we're inside this flask application and

00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:33,660
for job scheduling we evilly rely on on

00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:37,140
salary and as soon our business model

00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:40,680
changes we started having issues we had

00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:43,410
scalability issues we had too many and

00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:44,880
maintain dependencies especially I mean

00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,170
if asked is really nice but as soon as

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:51,010
you try to transform it to

00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:55,029
more changuk application you start to

00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:57,700
rely on too many external dependencies

00:10:55,029 --> 00:11:00,610
another thing is because we are a

00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:02,889
start-up and we we are still trying to

00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:05,649
understand what is our real business

00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:07,870
model we had like an improper leaky

00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:10,240
abstraction on top of our business model

00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:12,100
and another thing which is really easy

00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,649
when you write Python application is

00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,149
that we were too much formalized to the

00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:20,380
business logic and everything else was

00:11:16,149 --> 00:11:22,180
defined inside of the modules and that's

00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:30,339
what I consider our technical depth

00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:32,589
right now so as we start to grow one of

00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:34,750
the thing that we we have seen was the

00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:36,339
application wasn't providing us the

00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,560
right flexibility especially because

00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:41,589
we're growing and we want to be more

00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,600
flexible like I said we were we are

00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:48,699
still depending on too many an attain

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:50,079
sauce plugins and we don't have a will

00:11:48,699 --> 00:11:54,269
speak and well-defined boundaries

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,269
between the main bonus and its previous

00:11:54,899 --> 00:12:01,269
and the application is currently running

00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:05,140
on a ruku which was really good at the

00:12:01,269 --> 00:12:06,970
beginning but we started to see that the

00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:09,910
lack of rhenium containers was a problem

00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:12,699
because we couldn't make like each build

00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:14,529
really reproducible a rope is really

00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:18,310
nice it's also really expensive and not

00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:19,630
really flexible so it's super ok if you

00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,820
just want to run your application from

00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:24,279
github but as soon as soon as we have

00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,690
more complex like use cases and you want

00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:29,380
to be more flexible that's that's

00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:30,850
painful and also I joined like the

00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:33,640
company at the beginning of the year and

00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:35,740
we had like no metrics no logs

00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:39,550
so every time that you wanted to debug

00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:41,350
something was really painful and like I

00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:44,949
said at the beginning the application

00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:48,040
was also providing monitoring alerting

00:12:44,949 --> 00:12:49,690
which means we were doing the ingestion

00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,329
in directly in the fire flask

00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:54,160
application like receiving thousand of

00:12:52,329 --> 00:12:56,470
events every second which was killing

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,160
our performances because we were using

00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:59,160
just one database

00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:07,970
and for a reason that I can hardly

00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:10,490
understand we decided to try all the

00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:12,920
cloud providers so if you name one we

00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,990
were using it so we were running on a

00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,540
Roku the front tab was running on

00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:22,300
digital ocean and then we decide to try

00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:26,570
AWS and why not also DCP so we had

00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:30,019
managed oh like our entire stock on four

00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:32,839
different cloud providers so we decided

00:13:30,019 --> 00:13:35,930
to evolve to grow and we decided to do

00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,870
that on four different levels so we

00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:40,670
decided to consolidate to work on the

00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:42,980
consolidation of our platform on the

00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:47,779
architecture on being more cloud native

00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:49,250
and on the concept of observability so

00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:51,380
consolidate the first thing was to

00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:53,260
deprecated all the cloud providers and

00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:57,110
move to GCP so we made this decision

00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:59,209
we're going to migrate from Morocco to

00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:01,940
GCP we're going to migrate from digital

00:13:59,209 --> 00:14:04,640
asana to also GCP and the same for AWS

00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:07,640
and then we decided to fake technical

00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:10,160
depth so as a software team we can

00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,709
allocate about 25% of our time to work

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,740
on these things and you try to reduce

00:14:12,709 --> 00:14:19,370
the technique of that have you ever

00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:22,100
heard about the 10x developer yes no

00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:25,279
it's a normal developed an X developer

00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:29,000
so it's it's just a developer we use

00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,949
linters so you should use liters as well

00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,699
in the Python community we have many

00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:37,970
different so please check FLAC 8i short

00:14:34,699 --> 00:14:39,529
black and white they are extremely

00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:41,000
useful especially if you are like a

00:14:39,529 --> 00:14:42,380
small team and you want to be fast and

00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,519
you want to integrate these things with

00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:49,519
your CI CD and the last point about

00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:52,100
consolidate is about bill versus buy and

00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,990
manager vs. manage so we made a clear

00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,209
decision on ok we are not to build

00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:58,250
anything that which is not crucial or

00:14:56,209 --> 00:15:00,920
fundamental for ours business and the

00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:03,589
same for using only managed services so

00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:05,660
everything we're on you can think about

00:15:03,589 --> 00:15:10,100
kubernetes accepting manage same for the

00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:11,589
databases the same readies the only

00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,060
thing that we run is

00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:16,639
it's nothing actually because we also

00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:19,839
use impacts of service Griffin as a

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,839
service so everything

00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,430
another thing especially about technical

00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:27,649
depth which is extremely important as we

00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:29,420
started to hear things like we cannot

00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:33,019
build that features because it's too

00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:34,850
hard or we'll take too much time and for

00:15:33,019 --> 00:15:37,029
a start-up which which is like you know

00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:39,740
grow in face that's actually me that's

00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:43,040
like killing the innovations at the

00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:47,120
company so we decided to really put more

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,550
time and effort into this and like I

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,829
said I mean I especially love linters

00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,750
they extremely useful you take like one

00:15:51,829 --> 00:15:57,139
or two hours to configure them and then

00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:59,180
they're ready to run and they're really

00:15:57,139 --> 00:16:01,579
easy to integrate with your CIO city

00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:03,079
pipeline and I mean then you define yeah

00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:05,690
then you don't have to worry about the

00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:07,670
formatting of your vital code if you

00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:15,649
want to put a comma if you like to have

00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:20,209
an 80 chars or something else and the

00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:22,160
next point is about architecture so we

00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:24,110
started with a monolid application and

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,399
we started to realize that it was

00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:29,480
extremely hard to work on this

00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:33,410
application it was to be to her you

00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:35,120
start the chaps SEOs one of the like the

00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,860
next step that we want to chill inside

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,660
information move from a service-oriented

00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,329
architectures sorry to move from a model

00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,889
8 application to a service-oriented

00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:46,880
architectures we would like to have a

00:16:42,889 --> 00:16:49,399
more service separation which means we

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,870
want to remove from what we call the

00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:52,819
compost application all the parts that

00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:54,860
are related to phone control because

00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:57,850
that's the service monitoring and

00:16:54,860 --> 00:17:00,019
alerting is just something separated and

00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:03,920
we want to keep moving into this

00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:05,750
direction and related to monitoring and

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,339
alerting something that we just recently

00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:13,990
complete was to move data ingestion from

00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:17,900
the flask application to cloud functions

00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:18,650
and specifically about monitoring

00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,390
alerting

00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:25,050
we are not just doing data ingestion

00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:27,910
using cloud function but we also build

00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:32,050
- board directly on the man depending on

00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:34,480
the farm so every time that we install a

00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:36,520
new farm or we change the recipe of a

00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:39,190
farm the parameter inside the farm they

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,710
did a change which means that we need to

00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:44,110
have new alerting

00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:46,960
like levels new messages and all these

00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:49,150
things and especially during the summer

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,220
or between the summer of the winter the

00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:55,570
recipe of a farm change change many

00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:57,520
times and using Cal function using a

00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:59,650
smart Club function we can make the

00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,720
dashboard reactive so we can provision

00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:08,290
new dashboard using graphing and we can

00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:11,470
set new levels of alerting and we are

00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:14,860
using Python 2.7 for everything this is

00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:17,110
a blog announcement from the Google

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:20,560
cloud that row

00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:23,110
this was about announcing the general

00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:26,890
general availability of cloud function

00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:29,050
with Python with 3.7 which is extremely

00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:31,710
nice and there is a mention about what

00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:31,710
we're doing there

00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:37,930
what about cloud not Eve have you heard

00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:40,720
about this concept before raise your

00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:43,720
hand no I'm the only one okay a couple

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,780
of people okay so the first thing was to

00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:50,680
migrate to containers so also inside

00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:53,020
Iruka we are running containers which is

00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:54,730
somehow nice because then you can also

00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:57,430
run containers on your machine and it's

00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:59,320
everything more reproducible but it's

00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:01,600
just painful to run containers in just

00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:04,120
the Roku in Roku because the platform

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:06,970
was also with a different use case in

00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:09,160
mind we decided to introduce also

00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:12,540
infrastructure as code as a part of our

00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:16,270
migration from Roku to kubernetes and

00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:19,420
now every build inside our CI City

00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:24,310
whether is a PR or something master is a

00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:26,680
docker image and I'm leading the

00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:29,710
emigration to kubernetes I gave like a

00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:32,350
workshop on Monday and we are using the

00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:34,680
key which is the manage platform by by

00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,680
Google

00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:44,300
so what about observability have you

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:49,620
heard about this concept before

00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:52,740
yesterday okay yes so we decided to

00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:54,150
adopt a struct log I think I neck is

00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:56,670
giving a talk about this in another room

00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:58,320
is the maintainer a core developer it's

00:19:56,670 --> 00:20:01,590
extremely cool

00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:05,310
also we start having metrics with which

00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:10,380
means finally we know how many 400x

00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:15,690
errors we receive and we can be more

00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:17,370
proactive and another thing is that when

00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:20,280
you use stock log you can add like

00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:22,470
context to your logs which means you can

00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,190
you can interest back your application

00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:25,620
in a proper way

00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:27,450
and you can no I mean you and you will

00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,870
be able to know what is happening also

00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:33,360
in production and it's something

00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:35,310
completely different in so the first

00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:39,690
step was to you hukman our logs using

00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:41,370
stock log the next step like I said

00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:45,900
before is to have meaningful metrics and

00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:51,300
currently something we're working on it

00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:52,950
will be related to like could be ready

00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:55,050
to answer like a simple question like

00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:57,240
the number of arrow that you get on your

00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:58,560
load balancer but also something more

00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,600
like related to the number of queries

00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:04,170
that you get or the speed of your

00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:05,610
queries and this is extremely important

00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:11,070
otherwise you will feel like blind about

00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:14,220
your application and because we are

00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:19,470
running this a GCP and we we don't plan

00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:21,450
to run like anything we will use stock

00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:24,210
driver which is the logging a metric

00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:26,820
platform offer by Google the integration

00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:28,680
with kubernetes is amazing actually you

00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:31,800
get everything for free I mean it's it's

00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:33,600
everything already set and it's willing

00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,390
to created with it if you use struck log

00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,950
or if you use manual metrics and all the

00:21:36,390 --> 00:21:40,320
information all the metrics and logs

00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:43,100
from your kubernetes cluster they will

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,100
get directly there

00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:50,690
so the future of our software will be

00:21:47,809 --> 00:21:52,520
more microservices we plan to complete

00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:55,760
the migration to kubernetes by the end

00:21:52,520 --> 00:22:03,169
of the year and we will have a bit

00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:06,049
better and bigger focus on data so what

00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:07,940
I mean by data I mean yes we can start

00:22:06,049 --> 00:22:12,110
talking about the hype about artificial

00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:14,450
intelligence but there are really two

00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:18,290
things we are working on a team farm

00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:20,559
wait one is fully automated farms which

00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:23,840
means removing all the human labor work

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:28,370
so if you remember the movie matrix with

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:33,260
all this machine yes working on humans

00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:35,360
will do the same but with plants and the

00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:38,150
last thing is currently using particle

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,220
is a small micro device which is not

00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:42,140
really powerful but what's convenient at

00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:44,330
the beginning and the plan is do you

00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:46,160
have in the future in the farms edge

00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:48,470
computing which means you need to run a

00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,059
computer inside the farm because we want

00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:52,340
to have run machine learning algorithms

00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:54,260
there and the goal is to have fully

00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:56,240
automated farm with fully autonomous

00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:59,780
farm and each farm will be able to

00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:02,179
decide which is the best recipe I want

00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,600
to have a more tasty bÃ©zier what should

00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:05,030
I do

00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:06,919
so we want to reduce the human control

00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:11,750
over the farms and to make their more

00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:13,070
more smart also because like I said at

00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:16,250
the beginning we are using zero

00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:18,970
pesticides which is really nice but it's

00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:21,860
painful because there are many diseases

00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:25,100
which are already like they are not a

00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:28,820
problem anymore but as soon as you start

00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:31,820
not using pesticides anymore you will

00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:34,030
get like this or like 50% of your

00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:37,850
parents Queenie's you can easily die

00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:40,370
especially because many of the diseases

00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:42,260
are just brought by humans so if we

00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:46,090
reduce also their quantity of human

00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:46,090
labors we will also reduce this problem

00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:58,529
and also we plan to move to towards a

00:23:56,129 --> 00:24:02,610
more soft oriented company which means

00:23:58,529 --> 00:24:04,740
we will try to switch from a business

00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:07,289
model where producing farm is also a

00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:09,960
part of our business do you have a more

00:24:07,289 --> 00:24:12,259
service-oriented company because this is

00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,789
not like producing food is also research

00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:21,000
improving food quality and many other

00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:23,580
things so another thing we are working

00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,980
on right now and it's our first step

00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:28,799
towards artificial intelligence is

00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:31,440
fighting pests especially during the

00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:33,570
summer because of because of weather is

00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,909
warmer one of the thing that we see is

00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:38,700
we have something called shrinkage so

00:24:35,909 --> 00:24:41,009
having you start with one and a plants

00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,259
and then by the end of the four weeks

00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:45,330
you just have fifty percent of them

00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:48,539
which is really killing our production

00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:50,639
and one way to solve these issues is

00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:53,360
again using artificial intelligence in

00:24:50,639 --> 00:24:53,360
being more smart

00:24:59,029 --> 00:25:04,169
cool so thanks that's everything I had

00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:14,000
if you leave in the link we are hiring

00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:16,470
and I'm happy to take questions okay

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:21,470
thank you very much for that my talk

00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:21,470
okay questions who's got a question I

00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:25,799
have a question by the energy

00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:27,750
consumption if you grow your vegetables

00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:29,190
outside you get a Sun for free here you

00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:31,769
have to put energy did you have some

00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:33,840
kind of balance to balance how much

00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:35,850
energy you use compared to taking a

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,130
tractor and go into the field yes sir

00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:40,860
yes that's a good question it's hard to

00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:45,289
say because on our side we can control

00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:47,580
everything but if you control like the

00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:49,919
if you take into consideration have a

00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:53,190
thing we are much more efficient because

00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:54,929
we can reuse the water for example like

00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:56,399
I mean energy is not really a problem

00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:59,370
because especially in Germany you can

00:25:56,399 --> 00:26:01,950
use wind energy solar energy so it's

00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:05,190
more or less for free from you know the

00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:07,110
climate change perspective but for

00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:09,630
example we don't have like fuel concern

00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:13,769
because we remove too much compared to

00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:15,179
traditional farming so yes I mean so far

00:26:13,769 --> 00:26:17,419
the output is really good from that

00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:17,419
perspective

00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:28,369
thank you good talk so you basically

00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:31,190
showed the history of organic growth of

00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:34,399
startup from technical perspective and

00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:37,580
the question is if you started it today

00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:39,409
what would be your main decision changes

00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:43,009
like would you start from Q Burnett's

00:26:39,409 --> 00:26:46,580
would you start from microservices etc

00:26:43,009 --> 00:26:49,009
and the second question is no pesticides

00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:52,519
is good but what about taste

00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:53,509
do you have taste matrix or something

00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:56,299
like that

00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:58,460
thank you okay so to answer the first

00:26:56,299 --> 00:27:00,499
question what would they change like

00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:02,779
from a technical perspective if I could

00:27:00,499 --> 00:27:05,269
go back I mean everything is easier if

00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:07,700
you consider this no we will make many

00:27:05,269 --> 00:27:09,619
different decisions probably we will

00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:12,469
probably use jungle directly and not

00:27:09,619 --> 00:27:14,479
using flask we will avoid like Jesus in

00:27:12,469 --> 00:27:17,359
Euro Co and we will use like a different

00:27:14,479 --> 00:27:19,519
platform we will be like containerized

00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:25,129
since the beginning yeah many things

00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:28,070
they would be different and what was the

00:27:25,129 --> 00:27:29,599
second question sorry taste okay I'm

00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:34,879
from Italy and I know something about

00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:37,999
food taste trust me I tried the best

00:27:34,879 --> 00:27:39,739
herbs ever there because the taste of

00:27:37,999 --> 00:27:42,830
the herbs is connected to the first mass

00:27:39,739 --> 00:27:44,749
and if you remember like the video they

00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:46,549
still have the rules so when you buy

00:27:44,749 --> 00:27:48,889
them from the grocery shop they are like

00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:51,919
fresh like what fresh fresh you're still

00:27:48,889 --> 00:27:53,269
alive so they are super tasty not just

00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:56,269
but it taste but those about the smell

00:27:53,269 --> 00:28:00,759
so it's the best quality that you can

00:27:56,269 --> 00:28:00,759
have probably next

00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:05,580
two small questions first one is you

00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:07,630
know whether you chose to go with

00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:10,930
hydroponics or some sort of soil

00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:13,030
artificial soil and the second one is

00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:15,280
whether you think you'll be able to

00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:18,730
match the nutrient density of using

00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:24,460
organic farming you know with artificial

00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:27,150
solutions okay so so whatever what you

00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:30,040
have seen here it's a hydroponic system

00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:32,290
we plan to migrate to our points which

00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,309
is different but there is no soil inside

00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:38,830
it's just water

00:28:33,309 --> 00:28:43,750
and we use we use the water so it's a

00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:45,460
crown so you've got the plants one

00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:47,200
interesting thing is that we are not by

00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:49,510
you because by definition we don't have

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,830
sold so we cannot define ourselves like

00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:52,840
a bio product although we don't use

00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:56,320
pesticides and all these things so we

00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:59,740
also need to build like a new marketing

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:02,590
model for our customers so to answer

00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:04,740
your question yes we plan to increase

00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:06,970
them to work more on quality and

00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:08,500
currently we're using an idol planning

00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:12,330
system but the future especially for the

00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:12,330
fully automated farm is to be aeroponic

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,590
you mean

00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,470
while we control them because we have

00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,260
the fertilizer so we use three different

00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:34,690
kind of fertilizers and we try to

00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:37,390
minimize the use of fertilizer given the

00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:44,440
same quality so I cannot really compare

00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:46,090
with the organic farms hi yeah it's so

00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,860
awesome to see people not just doing

00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:50,080
another app but something real

00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:51,370
thank you in the start of the talk you

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,980
promised to feed the world and you

00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:56,710
cannot do it with just basil right you

00:29:53,980 --> 00:30:00,790
want Tomatoes your potatoes sweet

00:29:56,710 --> 00:30:03,520
what about like real crops so it's it's

00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:05,890
really up to you as soon as you have a

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:09,460
system which works then it's really hard

00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:10,960
to your fantasy if you have the system

00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:15,640
you can grow pretty much whatever you

00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:17,380
want like we use herbs because they are

00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,570
more sustainable from an economics

00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:21,750
perspective there is it to be sold to

00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:24,400
coffee shops and they are more expensive

00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:25,870
so that this phase of our business is

00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,370
the best way but there are like

00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:29,410
companies for example in Paris they are

00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:35,550
growing strawberries inside containers

00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:35,550
so it's really up to you next question

00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:45,779
hi I was wondering about the price point

00:30:41,999 --> 00:30:49,190
is it more expensive than the Basel that

00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:53,070
you buy in a plastic bag or and how much

00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:56,279
so the price for one herb is 1 euro and

00:30:53,070 --> 00:31:00,090
29 cents I think and it's more or less

00:30:56,279 --> 00:31:06,230
comparable to what you find sideshows so

00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:06,230
it's not super expensive thanks yep next

00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:14,519
thank you

00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:17,190
if you wanna if we want to implement

00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:20,429
your farm in other country for instance

00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:23,419
in Yemen or just kind of country can you

00:31:20,429 --> 00:31:26,879
give us your technique or equipment

00:31:23,419 --> 00:31:29,100
sorry can you give us your equipment

00:31:26,879 --> 00:31:33,149
your technical recommend for implements

00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:35,009
which is kind of farm in not developed

00:31:33,149 --> 00:31:38,159
country what you mean technical

00:31:35,009 --> 00:31:41,519
requirement from respective if you wanna

00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,929
just this kind of farm it's it's

00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,489
completely separated from your

00:31:42,929 --> 00:31:46,859
environment so as long as you have water

00:31:44,489 --> 00:31:49,529
and electricity I mean you have the

00:31:46,859 --> 00:31:52,409
fertilizer and the pH controls that's

00:31:49,529 --> 00:31:56,489
it's it's then you can put it wherever

00:31:52,409 --> 00:31:58,350
you want like yes s station Antarctica

00:31:56,489 --> 00:31:59,429
or really as long I mean you also need

00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:01,739
to control the temperature and all these

00:31:59,429 --> 00:32:04,289
things but it's this really unrelated to

00:32:01,739 --> 00:32:06,899
the place so you can use the same and

00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:08,749
you can use and apply the same strategy

00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:12,149
to different places

00:32:08,749 --> 00:32:13,919
hi yeah thanks for to talk I was just

00:32:12,149 --> 00:32:16,019
wondering you started by talking about

00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,999
how you're trying to solve world hunger

00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:20,429
because there's more and more people and

00:32:17,999 --> 00:32:22,200
you ended by describing your company in

00:32:20,429 --> 00:32:24,119
the dystopian way comparing it to the

00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,720
metrics which seems kind of weird to me

00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:26,970
sorry

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,139
yeah comparing it to the metrics which

00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:32,639
is not necessarily a great example ok

00:32:30,139 --> 00:32:34,080
it's always just wondering when you're

00:32:32,639 --> 00:32:35,700
cutting like one of your goals right now

00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,549
is automating and cutting people off

00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:41,070
from the production when we are going to

00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:43,379
double in size of population is that

00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:44,789
really good goal or what do you think

00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:47,999
about it you mean because then we

00:32:44,789 --> 00:32:50,100
haven't unemployed people maybe yeah but

00:32:47,999 --> 00:32:51,040
I don't know to me that's like a false

00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:54,190
problem here

00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:56,290
we saw the same before so technical

00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:58,090
evolution Industrial Revolution they are

00:32:56,290 --> 00:33:01,060
also happening right now so you will

00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:03,870
just get new kind of jobs you also need

00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:05,680
to control the farms operate the farms

00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:10,510
maintainence the farm attaining the

00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:14,890
farms who sure but I don't think it's

00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:17,380
like a problem at the end I was

00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:20,640
wondering if you throw in a bunch of

00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:24,520
insects in your funds for pollination

00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:28,930
for pollination no but you fight

00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:36,070
diseases yes to fight diseases we use

00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:40,570
bugs hi hello thanks for a great talk

00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:43,810
I wonder if you're consider like

00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:47,470
autonomous installations or or your

00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:50,950
farms must rely on reliable internet

00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:54,240
connection to your cloud services to to

00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:56,500
monitor to run actually this farm or you

00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,290
consider this like autonomous

00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:01,930
installation so each farm is more or

00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:04,030
less autonomous as long as it has like a

00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:06,670
configuration inside it just keep

00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:09,340
running the configuration of course you

00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:11,140
need to have electricity in water but

00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:13,840
yes it can run for like a week or a

00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:16,360
couple of weeks without like internet

00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:17,860
connection I mean that's also a problem

00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:19,330
because then you cannot apply all the

00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:22,080
monitoring and alerting pipeline like

00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:24,940
okay water is is not there anymore so

00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:26,530
they are not really built with the idea

00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:31,110
of being completely disconnected from

00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:31,110
Internet next person

00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:39,510
hey are you planning to release any of

00:34:36,810 --> 00:34:42,690
the specifics that are used for the

00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:45,060
hardware in an open-source way or in a

00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:48,620
way that people can maybe rebuild or

00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:50,639
build on top of this or build with this

00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:53,190
your turkey is specifically about the

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:54,570
farms right yes yes that's one of the

00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:56,250
idea that we have also inside the

00:34:54,570 --> 00:35:02,940
company also because our business in the

00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:04,020
future will not be to build the farms hi

00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,820
very nice talk

00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:09,780
my question is regarding all the

00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:11,790
hardware involved for these farms and if

00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:14,190
your company bought some like use

00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:19,500
something out of the box or if you

00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:21,900
developed everything so our farming is

00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:24,210
expensive but if you open the bottom

00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,920
container it's really cheap inside like

00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:27,840
we have many components but it's

00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,730
something that you can buy and in the

00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:37,370
market it's not something super

00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:41,280
high-tech yeah yeah yeah yes you know

00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:44,460
you mentioned that you want to the world

00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,620
so so do you have metrics about the

00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:49,290
sustainability of such system like

00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:52,560
because you have to provide lights and

00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:54,480
that looks like a lot of energy to grow

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,300
your plants so do you have metrics about

00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,010
this I guess we have some metrics about

00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:01,380
this but when you talk about the

00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:02,910
sustainability you mean to produce the

00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:06,570
farm and then to run the firm or just

00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:08,100
run the farm so we have so we have

00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:10,170
mattress for both actually I'm not

00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:12,510
really updated about them but the thing

00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:14,310
is energy will not be really a problem

00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:17,400
so there are things that are much more

00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:20,430
important like water I mean we use like

00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:23,430
90% of the water compared to 90 percent

00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:26,190
less water compared to normal farms and

00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:29,070
that's an issue in many places like it's

00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:31,830
it's it's easy to have like low cost or

00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:33,330
free energy water is like limited good

00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:35,340
water is like limited that's a big issue

00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:39,440
and we're more much more concerned about

00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:41,430
using in a proper way water than energy

00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,930
another question going back to the

00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:46,280
beginning slides you said we need to

00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:48,920
increase production by 25 percent

00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:50,420
vases up to 50% so if you do the math if

00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,360
it just reduce bass would solve the

00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:57,590
problem it's the same with the diet it's

00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:58,970
just not that easy and then like we know

00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:02,060
the problems the solution are there

00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:03,350
apply them it's another thing sadly but

00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:05,780
yes just really I mean they're all so

00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:10,150
many start up working on reducing food

00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:12,230
waste but that's the sad reality yeah

00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:17,750
currently we are not doing our best and

00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:21,440
we have different solutions head up high

00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:23,510
you said that you use AI to control and

00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:26,300
optimize your external parameters like

00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:27,770
pH and water not yet

00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:29,780
that's the future okay that's the future

00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:32,330
and do you plan to do it also for

00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:35,450
choosing your seeds or do you do you

00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:38,540
plan to do any genes manipulations no no

00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:40,820
we don't work so we use our GM so we

00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:43,250
don't use like a jam so from that

00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:44,750
perspective is we don't plan to apply

00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:48,080
anything to you genius or things like

00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:50,240
this but inside a farm we run that we

00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:51,770
like we grow different type of crops so

00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:55,160
we probably want to use machine learning

00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:57,170
to find the best combination because

00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:03,080
that will also help to fight diseases so

00:37:57,170 --> 00:38:04,310
we also need a plane that way me I got a

00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:06,740
question Jeff

00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:08,750
the business looks like amazing for

00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:13,340
customer perspective but you say you

00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:17,900
change it to b2b yes why so if one of

00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:19,460
your farming my house so if you go on

00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,690
Kickstarter and you will look for you

00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:23,000
farm you will see the crowdfunding

00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:24,440
campaign by the funders they were going

00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,070
around building teaching people how to

00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:29,750
grow herbs or whatever tomatoes inside

00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:31,910
their apartments and they were going

00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:33,230
around with a caravan and they were

00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:37,160
teaching people so that that's like

00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:38,600
their soul but it didn't work and as

00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:40,580
soon as they tried to switch to

00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:43,100
business-to-business so they try to

00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:45,830
connect with grocery shop or shopping

00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:48,320
markets they had a different feedback

00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:51,350
it's just more sustainable so running a

00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,390
farm inside our grocery shop like Attica

00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:55,340
it's just marketing it's not sustainable

00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:57,950
from a business perspective you need to

00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:58,550
have multiple funds together to run down

00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:02,960
effect

00:38:58,550 --> 00:39:04,340
from I like money-wise so yes there are

00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,210
different companies working also in

00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:10,190
there but running a farm it's expensive

00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:13,070
like it's you have daily operation that

00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:14,690
you need to perform sir sorry for now I

00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:19,190
didn't have like a Francis all to solve

00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:21,410
you sorry can I just ask a question of

00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:25,490
your different solutions change our diet

00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:27,500
reduce waste and use technology how you

00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:30,800
know what percentage would you attribute

00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:35,240
to all of these to be able to solve this

00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:37,070
world food population problem I don't

00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:39,860
know I mean start to say I mean changing

00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:41,510
our diets like inexpensive right it's

00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:45,380
just changing what you put inside our

00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:47,840
fridge again many things are just

00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:51,620
changing our habits which it should be

00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:53,960
cheaper cheaper somehow but it's not if

00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:55,490
we don't want to change our like way of

00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:59,060
living music technology probably the

00:39:55,490 --> 00:40:01,520
best way so I like to define like a

00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:04,430
prince for a percentage okay so you say

00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:08,660
maybe human beings are quiet lazy and

00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:09,890
technology is the answer is yes also but

00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,360
you also need to consider that people

00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:13,070
from developing countries are growing

00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:16,670
and they want to behave like Western

00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:18,620
people and then you cannot say to them

00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:20,210
okay just try to reduce waste or change

00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:21,620
our diet they will say I don't care you

00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:24,460
spent like the last 50 years than you're

00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,460
saying now it's my time

00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:36,500
what about policy I mean you didn't like

00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:39,110
post it's pretty important but it's not

00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:41,510
in the list here so and policy can drive

00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:43,910
technology can change your diet can

00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:47,870
reduce waste and can help with all these

00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:53,120
things policy you mean a regulation

00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:54,470
coming from the nation's do we want to

00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:59,390
talk about the police equipment or

00:40:54,470 --> 00:41:01,310
something like this I think yeah it

00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:02,690
could be maybe you want to be before the

00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:04,970
end of the world I don't know I don't

00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:07,790
trust regulation so much I mean can be

00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:09,320
helpful but it takes a lot of time do

00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:12,250
you think that these solutions might

00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:14,080
increase population growth even further

00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:16,300
and make the problem worse because as

00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:22,000
humans is our nature so push things to

00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:25,540
the limit and yeah sure I mean sure sure

00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,150
sure sure so you're gonna stop I heard

00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:37,690
this like concern yes yes you can reduce

00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:40,090
like food production then we'll see okay

00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:48,250
we've got time for one more question and

00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:51,340
so hi I have a last question about what

00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:55,359
link back to the tooling for Python so

00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:59,170
you mentioned that you you moved to

00:41:55,359 --> 00:42:02,020
using more linters for instance and in

00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:05,790
that sense did you start from scratch or

00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:08,770
did you enhance what you had and if so

00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:10,330
what was basically your what would be

00:42:08,770 --> 00:42:12,400
your best practice and how to go for

00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:14,980
that and if you didn't fall into the

00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,780
fallacy of releasing the lintels too

00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:20,170
much because in the end you want to have

00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:20,650
like only I do like to have all green

00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:24,820
actually

00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:26,589
so it's also pleasing myself but see I

00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:31,780
wasn't at the company at the time but

00:42:26,589 --> 00:42:34,530
from from what I heard yes they they did

00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:38,380
all this but with the linters

00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:40,750
considering the old code base so someone

00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:44,760
spent like a week or maybe two and apply

00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:46,930
the linters until everything was Green

00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,930
if you have a very large code base

00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:51,700
probably not the best practice maybe you

00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:56,560
can just apply the interesting and new

00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:58,450
changes that's a way but I think that in

00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:03,339
our case the changes weren't so big and

00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:04,900
it was okay okay thank you very much can

00:43:03,339 --> 00:43:07,710
you please give a warm round of applause

00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:07,710
for you Christian

00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:11,450
