	"Are women underrepresented in the High Performance Computing (HPC) community?
[EuroPython 2019 - Keynote - 2019-07-11 - MongoDB]
[Basel, CH]

By Athina Frantzana 

This study is the first attempt to understand the current gender demographics of the HPC community, and identify potential reasons and ways to tackle the gender imbalance. By listening to the people who constitute the community, the study offers a guideline on what the HPC community should focus on in order to become more attractive, accessible and useful to everyone.

so so I'm asking friends Anna thank you

00:00:05,189 --> 00:00:11,040
for introducing me and thank you all for

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:14,700
being here um so that's the title of my

00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:18,930
talk but first a little bit about who I

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:22,050
am and why I'm here so I'm a former

00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:24,990
scientist and I have just completed my

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,609
PhD on women's representation and

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,269
experiences in the high-performance

00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:30,000
computing

00:00:27,269 --> 00:00:32,910
and here I am celebrating the passing of

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,010
my father so I'm a tireless advocate of

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,510
equality diversity and inclusion in STEM

00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,230
through my projects and the

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,970
organizations I'm active member of so

00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:45,060
here I am talking about my work on

00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:48,960
Wikipedia and Here I am pretending to be

00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:51,420
a robot for an outreach activity and so

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,960
last year I attended the women's event

00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,700
of your Python in Edinburgh where I had

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,680
some excellent discussions about women

00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:59,970
in computing and programming and I

00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,940
believe this is the reason I'm here

00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,860
today however I have to admit that when

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,520
I first got the invitation to be a

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:10,799
keynote speaker my first reaction was

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:14,579
I'm not a programmer so why do you want

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,619
me that when I started my research more

00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:20,249
than four years ago the topic of gender

00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:24,359
in stem in the generate balance in stem

00:01:20,249 --> 00:01:27,179
who was not as hot as it is now there

00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:30,329
has been a crazy sudden focus on that

00:01:27,179 --> 00:01:32,189
topic and so many initiatives projects

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:34,979
and individuals appear to care about it

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:36,539
and try to solve the issue most of the

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,240
times by trying to increase the number

00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:40,619
of women in the workplace panels or else

00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,649
thinking and hoping that this is the

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:45,810
solution of the problem so I believe I

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:46,920
was reasonably answer and suspicious

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,899
when I was called to be a keynote

00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:51,749
speaker at the program programming

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:54,960
conference with as far as I'm aware a

00:01:51,749 --> 00:01:58,469
low number of women and as far as I can

00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,090
see in here after a chat I had with the

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:02,399
chair of the program group I understood

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,619
that the European group actually care

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,170
and they want to discuss about gender

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:08,880
gender imbalance and raise awareness so

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,500
I'm particularly happy to be here and

00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,960
share my research findings with you

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,240
today

00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:17,550
so why gender imbalance is important and

00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,070
we need to talk about it apart from the

00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:21,830
obvious reasons of equal opportunities

00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:24,540
and a larger variety of options for all

00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:27,140
research has shown that gender balanced

00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,520
teams demonstrate better performance and

00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:33,420
better collaborations among team members

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:36,390
and higher productivity in comparison to

00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:38,520
male or female dominated teams it has

00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,140
also been noted that gender diversity

00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,020
could take research to different roots

00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:44,370
which might lead to new discoveries

00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,860
improve the quality of products and

00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,980
cover all needs for example there is a

00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,170
project which addresses the limitation

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,030
of understanding diseases diseases and

00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:55,830
developing the most effective treatments

00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,950
due to gender balance in medical

00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:01,290
research finally there has been a high

00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,970
demand in STEM jobs and it is expected

00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:05,220
to grow even more in the future and

00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,250
report so that it will be difficult to

00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:11,040
fill in these positions due to limited

00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:12,810
talent pool so what has been done to

00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,790
achieve gender balance the gender

00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,910
imbalance system as I said earlier might

00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:20,190
be a currently hot topic but it's not

00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:22,530
new very various policies and strategies

00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,360
have been developed to tackle that

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,340
identified barriers that girls and women

00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,340
meet while studying or pursuing a career

00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:31,440
in stem providing data that so the low

00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:33,840
numbers of women in STEM related subject

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,020
is key to raise awareness and motivate

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,270
action for improvement outreach programs

00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,670
which encourage girls and expose them to

00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:43,380
STEM careers and female role models have

00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:46,820
been proved to have a positive effect on

00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:49,350
girls and girls interest and engagement

00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:52,020
particularly role models seem to help

00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:54,230
girls change their stereotypical views

00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:57,180
on STEM careers and to help women

00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:59,100
mentoring also seem to have a positive

00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,350
impact on women's confidence and

00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,450
progression equal diversity and

00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:05,790
inclusion and unconscious bias training

00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:07,680
is one of the most popular strategies

00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:11,760
institution and companies use to raise

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,380
awareness and reduce biases however even

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,000
though some studies show the trainings

00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:20,100
these trainings have a positive effect a

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,380
lot of reports indicate that such

00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,720
trainings have no or little impact or

00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,700
sometimes even negative impact an

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,110
important conclusion of those reports is

00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,129
that for such trainings to have a

00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:32,050
significant in

00:04:30,129 --> 00:04:34,000
positive impact on gender balance they

00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:36,610
must be part of a wider program of

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,889
actions finally since maternity leave

00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:41,169
and caring responsibilities have been

00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:42,280
identified as obstacles for women to

00:04:41,169 --> 00:04:44,199
advance in their career

00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,780
the third parental leave policy has been

00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:49,439
introduced but its effect on gender

00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:52,000
equality has not been established yet

00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,669
however all those policies and

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,039
strategies do seem to have a positive

00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:59,889
impact but have they affected the number

00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:02,259
of women in STEM the latest statistics

00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:03,759
so that there is a small increase of

00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:05,860
female student enrollments instead

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,960
subject in comparison to last year or

00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,729
the year before but still the numbers of

00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,729
female students are too small in

00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:15,430
comparison to male ones for example

00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:18,219
according to the higher education

00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:21,150
statistics 2000 more female students

00:05:18,219 --> 00:05:25,960
enrolled in computer science in the year

00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:28,659
2017 2018 in comparison to 2015-2016 but

00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:31,349
similarly a lot more female students

00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:35,430
added to the already very high number

00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:38,500
this statistics is for the UK by the way

00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:40,509
so all the informations from mentioned

00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:42,879
and my personal experiences and the fact

00:05:40,509 --> 00:05:49,259
that there there was no previous study

00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:49,259
or report sorry I just lost my talk No

00:05:51,960 --> 00:06:00,490
thank you I'm also not an experienced

00:05:56,469 --> 00:06:01,690
speaker thank you so my personal

00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:03,400
experience and the fact that there was

00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,289
no previous study or report on the

00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,819
gender balance tattoos of the HPC

00:06:05,289 --> 00:06:09,219
community even though it's an

00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:11,469
interesting area that spans vary stem

00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:13,089
and non-stem subjects motivated the

00:06:11,469 --> 00:06:15,339
establishment of the women in HPC

00:06:13,089 --> 00:06:17,889
network and my research on this topic

00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:20,229
women in HPC is a network that brings

00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:22,509
women of the community together promote

00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:24,210
and support them and raise awareness on

00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:26,560
equality diversity inclusion matters

00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:28,900
since then he talked anecdotally and

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,729
traditionally the majority of HPC users

00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,949
and technical experts have a stem

00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:34,330
background I hypothesized that there is

00:06:32,949 --> 00:06:36,339
a high chance for women to be

00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,860
underrepresented in the HPC community

00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:41,760
however that's a further investigation

00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:44,130
so I wanted to find out if the

00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,380
same or similar reasons and obstacles as

00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:49,230
for women in stem keep women away from

00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:52,560
HPC or if there are specific problems

00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:55,440
within the community for this I firstly

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,510
attempted to demonstrate evidence that

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,730
women are underrepresented in HPC and

00:06:57,510 --> 00:07:02,670
then to identify reasons and ways of

00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:05,070
improvement to obtain a first picture of

00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:08,040
the women in the HPC community I decide

00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:09,840
to examine historical demographics of

00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,870
two different settings which are

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,760
potentially educators of the

00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:19,140
participation and contribution of women

00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:23,850
in the community I'd have some issues

00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:27,630
with I joined analyzed not the names of

00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:30,660
more than 27,000 participants at major

00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:32,850
HPC related conferences as well as more

00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:35,790
specialist conferences that concern HPC

00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:38,550
related topics I examined the numbers of

00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:41,130
women participated as keynote speakers

00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:43,890
paper and poster authors and presenters

00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:46,170
works workshop and tutorial organizers

00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:49,110
and presenters and committee members and

00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:50,850
attendees also since programming is

00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:53,400
considered traditionally as one of the

00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:55,800
basic skills that one needs to use the

00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,780
HPC facilities I calculated the

00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:00,050
participation of women and men to

00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,820
training courses for HPC users and/or

00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:05,150
developers provided by Archer UK's

00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:07,640
national supercomputing service I

00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:10,680
collected an adult analyzed data from

00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:13,500
five years and very various levels and

00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:16,230
courses for example level one includes

00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,870
introduction to HPC level two scientific

00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:23,790
programming with Python and level 3

00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:25,830
advanced MPI from the conference data

00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:27,390
analysis I found that women were fewer

00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:29,880
than men in all categories of

00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:31,710
participation on average I found that

00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,960
there were nine percent female paper

00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:36,630
authors zero to one female invited

00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:39,090
speakers for every four male 7 to 12

00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:41,700
female percent female poster authors and

00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:45,330
one female work supported other tutorial

00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,950
presenter for every 8 to 11 male an

00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:49,050
important finding that six further

00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,210
research is that in the cases where

00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:53,250
women in HP CEO diversity committees

00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:55,290
were active there was an increase of

00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,899
women for example at the

00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,699
for computing conference in USA female

00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:04,350
invited speakers increased from 30

00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:05,670
percent in 2013 to 46 percent in 2016 we

00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,839
believe that the appointment of a

00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,670
Diversity Committee by the

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:13,110
supercomputing conference is the reason

00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:15,720
for this improvement from a total of 667

00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:17,850
and analyzed courses I found that women

00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,130
were outnumbered three to one by men at

00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:22,740
all levels from the analysis of the same

00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:24,750
data I also found that women had much

00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,269
higher attendance frequency at level one

00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:29,519
courses women were identified more as

00:09:27,269 --> 00:09:32,069
users than developers from their choice

00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,810
of courses and their difficulty rating

00:09:32,069 --> 00:09:36,449
increased gradually with the course

00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:39,509
levels similarly with the conference's I

00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:42,420
noticed that course is organized by

00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:44,579
women in HPC attracted more women for

00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:46,889
example at eleven one course organized

00:09:44,579 --> 00:09:49,259
by women need to be seen in 2015 there

00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:52,829
were 24 female participants and only one

00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:54,569
male participant service can produce

00:09:52,829 --> 00:09:56,699
data for both quantitative and

00:09:54,569 --> 00:09:59,250
qualitative analysis I decided to run a

00:09:56,699 --> 00:10:02,130
survey for the HPC community to discuss

00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:04,380
our so far findings and hypotheses and

00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:06,510
gather evidence that added to our

00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,550
quantitative results as well as 25

00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:12,540
Arya's for further investigation and

00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:13,829
improvement in the community some of the

00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,170
most important findings from the

00:10:13,829 --> 00:10:17,790
analysis of the survey data are that

00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,319
most men and women come from stem

00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:21,420
background and they believe that there

00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:24,510
is a net present representation of women

00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:26,880
in HPC women are less likely than men to

00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:29,250
receive training programming training

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,350
and develop their own software and also

00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:33,510
women are more likely to be affected by

00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:37,110
parent who travel less to conferences

00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:39,060
feel discriminated in being interested

00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:43,170
in having a mentor and feel that they

00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:44,730
belong in minority group finally a very

00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:47,130
important finding is that there were

00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:49,589
clear differences in training and

00:10:47,130 --> 00:10:52,680
software development tendency between

00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:54,779
the stem and the non stem groups that

00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:58,259
means that people who have a stem

00:10:54,779 --> 00:11:00,779
background receive more training and

00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:03,000
they develop more their own software in

00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:05,459
comparison to people that come from non

00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,900
STEM subjects this is of great

00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:09,150
importance

00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:11,279
because it supports the hypothesis that

00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:12,900
people from non-stem background do not

00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,880
receive enough or at all programming

00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:18,090
training which might be one of the

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,010
obstacles that keep these people from

00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:22,200
using HPC facilities for the research

00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:24,270
and this can have an impact on the

00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,490
gender balance of the community since

00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:30,360
non STEM subjects tend to have better

00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:31,890
gender balance finally for gaining an

00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,600
in-depth understanding of the

00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:35,970
experiences of the people of the HPC

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,190
community I conducted interviews and

00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:40,529
focus group discussions hearing from a

00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:44,970
total of 48 people about their

00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:46,680
background and the relation to HPC HPC

00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,600
community personal stories and views

00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,700
help me support and interpret my

00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,900
previous findings and stimulate new

00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,950
ideas or hypotheses for future work

00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:58,200
similarly here the majority of

00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,279
interviewees come from a stem subject

00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:02,040
believe that there is an under

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,050
presentation of women and the reasons

00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,240
are similar to the reasons for women to

00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:08,250
be underrepresented in STEM subjects

00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,010
with stereotypes and discrimination

00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,970
being top in the list

00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:13,830
additionally some really important

00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:16,620
findings came of this research method

00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:19,560
the lack of formal training and earlier

00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:22,830
exposure to HPC are major barriers for

00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:25,440
entering the HPC community especially to

00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:27,660
people for especially for people coming

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,460
from non-computational background here

00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:32,580
you can see some of the codes from the

00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:34,110
interviewees indeed most of the

00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,330
participants reported that they're

00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:38,040
self-taught in programming and that the

00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:40,530
training provided is not adequate

00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,570
however women as soon as they start

00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:44,730
programming and using SPC they prefer

00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:47,070
computational research rather than

00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:48,839
theory or lab based a lot of women

00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:50,940
complained about the lack of support and

00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:52,890
the unfriendly male-dominated technician

00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:54,870
environment as well as the language

00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:56,370
being used being too technical for

00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:58,920
people not coming from compute

00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:02,730
computational background but probably

00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:04,709
the most serious HPC specific problem is

00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:07,110
that the HPC community and its

00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:09,120
development seem to be focused more on

00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,950
the power and the size of the machines

00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,940
rather than the science they are used

00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:16,950
for and the users needs this image makes

00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:20,250
the community fairly unattractive to

00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:23,040
some and mostly to women also it was

00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:25,170
it was called as a closed club by many

00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:27,120
interviewees that is only open to

00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:29,640
specific people and projects from

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,260
specific backgrounds other important

00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,390
findings from the qualitative method

00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:35,790
including interviewees positive view on

00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:37,950
mentoring and role models their negative

00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:39,960
view on current equality diversity and

00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,820
inclusion training and their suggestions

00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:44,370
for improving the communities gender

00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:46,470
balance with main ones being programming

00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:48,840
to schools and all disciplines outreach

00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:51,210
promotion of female role models chains

00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:54,060
of perception of stem and HPC as

00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:58,260
something hard and something that is not

00:13:54,060 --> 00:14:00,300
related to real life so what are the

00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:02,430
main conclusions of this study and how

00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:06,240
can we use these findings are women in

00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:08,730
HPC actually underrepresented yes they

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,710
aren't represented in the HPC community

00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:13,230
the quantitative approach to my study

00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:15,300
revealed a clear under presentation of

00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:17,700
women at conferences and courses of the

00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:19,530
HPC community intentionally from the

00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:22,020
other methods it was clear that the

00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:23,910
majority of the HPC community belongs to

00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,470
the stem group which supported our

00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:27,480
hypothesis that women must be

00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,730
underrepresented in the HPC community

00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,740
since statistics show that they are

00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:34,080
underrepresented in most of the in the

00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,920
most of the STEM subjects consequently

00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,900
the reasons of these

00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,760
under-representation are mostly similar

00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:41,100
to those that caused the low numbers of

00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:44,520
women in stem however as we said earlier

00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:49,140
HPC has its own obstacles for women with

00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:54,810
main ones the the inadequate formal

00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:56,430
training and the image of HPC so what do

00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:58,620
we need to focus on to attract and

00:14:56,430 --> 00:15:00,480
retain more women in the HPC community

00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:03,450
programming and commuting in generally

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:05,340
we know we know what the problems are we

00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:07,530
need to act in the right ways to solve

00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:10,050
the problem and hopefully improve the

00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:12,210
situation we need to understand and make

00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:13,980
clear why gender balance and equality

00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:16,320
and diversity inclusion are important

00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:18,000
and how to achieve them and not just

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,060
rely on changing the numbers

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,920
artificially and force it to happen we

00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,200
need to break the stereotypes of stem

00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:27,450
programming and computing by offering

00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,910
exposure to these subjects and to female

00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:32,040
role models as soon as possible as early

00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,180
as possible and create equal

00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,740
opportunities

00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:36,240
as we mentioned earlier a lot of

00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,340
initiatives policies and strategies

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,560
exist but if they don't act

00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:42,840
collaboratively and if we don't measure

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:46,110
the impact and evaluate them they cannot

00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:48,630
have the desirable effects finally there

00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:51,240
will always be obstacles men who don't

00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:53,520
think that there is an issue women who

00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,710
like to be seen as special people who

00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,750
take advantage of this imbalance we

00:15:55,710 --> 00:15:59,820
should not let them stop the progress we

00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,980
should fight them with evidence produce

00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,810
reports and published data promote

00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,510
equality diversity and inclusion and

00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:12,500
evaluate your actions engage men and

00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:12,500
senior staff change the future thank you

00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:20,419
[Applause]

00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,890
thank you very much I'd like to thank

00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:29,550
the University of Edinburgh for funding

00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:31,290
my research and women in HPC Network for

00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:34,260
initiating it and also would like to

00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:36,570
thank the committee for inviting me here

00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:38,940
today and all of you who were interested

00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:40,960
enough to attend my talk so early in the

00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:46,660
morning thank you

00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:54,100
[Applause]

00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:56,470
I don't know what's happening so guys if

00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:59,310
you have questions for Athena this is

00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:59,310
the time to shine

00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:19,659
people thanks for the talk in the

00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:24,579
metrics that you show for indicators for

00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:26,319
for gender imbalance or I missed one

00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:30,000
that I have seen in some conferences

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:33,850
which is the ratio of people

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,770
participating in in Q&A oh yeah yeah

00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:38,679
which i think is very interesting also

00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:44,140
for highlighting the difference between

00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:47,320
the artificially gender balance and the

00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:49,870
real gender balance so many times in in

00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:53,440
conference that are aware of the problem

00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:59,320
they they balance the the speakers but

00:17:53,440 --> 00:18:02,260
at the end the Q&A are like yeah so I so

00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:04,570
I try to see that as well but I didn't

00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:07,000
have enough date of that because to

00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:08,950
actually gather data for this I had to

00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,380
attend all the conferences and you know

00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:13,240
like writing down the numbers so I did

00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:15,669
but it wasn't enough to prove something

00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,669
but the ones the ones I did actually

00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:21,309
there wasn't a significant difference

00:18:18,669 --> 00:18:24,159
from the questions women asked and men

00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:27,100
asked but it's not enough to draw a

00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:29,380
conclusion I'm afraid so just point this

00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:32,070
maybe this would this would be a nice

00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:35,020
improvement in the inter PyCon

00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:37,299
conferences just to have someone in the

00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:41,820
organization taking note of the gender

00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:44,530
and make sure yes that's what I meant by

00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:47,110
publishing data and you know gather

00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:48,159
evidence yeah that's I totally agree

00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:53,260
with you thank you

00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:56,770
we have actually we are doing this

00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:59,559
especially for speakers so what we also

00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:00,370
for data protection we not necessarily

00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:03,159
ask for a jam

00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:06,100
and in the submission so we usually do

00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:08,740
sistex on guessing on the first names

00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:12,909
and doing some research so we do care a

00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:16,000
lot good thank you yeah that's how I did

00:19:12,909 --> 00:19:17,970
it I guessed it from the first name as

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,770
you said because of data protection

00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:26,169
which makes my job harder so of course

00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:30,659
that has a little threat of validity

00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:33,460
there because yes I used an API to a

00:19:30,659 --> 00:19:35,679
platform with first names but of course

00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:38,559
there is always up ok so making a

00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:42,549
mistake ok we have one more question

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:44,320
again yes I am you mentioned by then

00:19:42,549 --> 00:19:47,500
that there are those who would take

00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,539
advantage of the gender imbalance can

00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,520
you clarify a little bit because it

00:19:49,539 --> 00:19:56,309
doesn't seem to be any advantage at all

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:58,750
in this I'm happy to clarify that so

00:19:56,309 --> 00:20:01,600
from my experience because I mean this

00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:03,279
area of trying to solve the problem of

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,470
the code everest inclusion so i had i

00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:08,919
have been involved with many projects

00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:10,960
and what i have noticed is that even

00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:14,230
though there are a lot of there's a lot

00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:17,529
of funding right now that is been given

00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:20,529
to two projects that try to solve this

00:20:17,529 --> 00:20:24,820
problem the problem seemed not to be

00:20:20,529 --> 00:20:26,440
solved so it's not very nice to say that

00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:30,279
but i'm afraid that there are people

00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:33,370
that just want to these two to be

00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:37,210
perpetuated just because two they

00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:39,730
receive funding it's very hard to say

00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:41,919
that and not very nice but it happens

00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:43,919
unfortunately so some people take

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:47,140
advantage of that and also some people

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:50,529
try to promote themselves by pretending

00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:53,470
that they are advocates of equal

00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:57,070
diversity inclusion and actually just do

00:20:53,470 --> 00:21:01,630
it to put it in their CV it happens I'm

00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:03,039
afraid I hope that covered we have one

00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:04,659
more question and by the way if you have

00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:07,779
questions please come forward to the

00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:08,890
microphones sorry I can't see you yeah

00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:13,299
there's one question here in the front

00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:13,740
ok hello I was just wondering if you

00:21:13,299 --> 00:21:16,260
have like

00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:19,080
concrete tip the euro patent could

00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:21,870
implement next year to help to the first

00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:25,950
II yeah so from apart from what we said

00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:27,990
already that gather data gender data and

00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:29,130
it would be good to have I don't know if

00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:31,410
these years

00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:34,470
if these gear you have a women in that

00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:37,230
event here like the one I attended last

00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:38,700
year in and Umbra I think you don't so

00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:41,670
that was really nice so that would be

00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:43,830
nice to to have an event where all women

00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:47,340
can gather but also I wrote an article

00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:49,590
about that last year and I asked men as

00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:51,510
well to attend it because it's really

00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:55,500
important to have men as well at this

00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:58,290
event so they can see you know mingle

00:21:55,500 --> 00:22:01,530
with women of the community and in the

00:21:58,290 --> 00:22:05,929
nice way and see what the problems are

00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:05,929
and what what they can do to help them

00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:16,230
hi hi so first of all thank you very

00:22:11,309 --> 00:22:19,110
much and yes we just we don't have this

00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:21,809
year this this event we also attended

00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:24,570
last year but I'm glad that we decided

00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:28,350
to have a plenary talk so that everyone

00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:30,360
could actually attend and I mean listen

00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:32,970
to this topic but my question is you

00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:35,400
mentioned that training for unconscious

00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:38,190
bias and I was wondering if you have any

00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:42,720
tips on how to actually handle this

00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:46,820
because this is often I find also in my

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:49,760
field in in physics one of the most

00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:52,890
atrocious problems

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:56,220
yeah so you have attended an enclosed

00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:58,290
advice training no I well I mean I have

00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:01,200
listened yes ii talked i've studied on

00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:04,260
my own but i would like to understand if

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:07,920
there's if you have tips on how to give

00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:10,500
training on the unconscious bias and so

00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:12,270
from my experience the majority of the

00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,490
people I talked with from the HPC

00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:16,880
community they as I mentioned in my talk

00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:19,140
they had a negative opinion on those

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,950
trainings equality diversity inclusion

00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:24,450
and unconstant for example the

00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:27,630
University of Edinburgh

00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:30,660
offers an online training which is like

00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:31,110
literally taking the box of yeah we did

00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,600
that

00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:35,550
okay you don't learn anything you don't

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,710
understand the problems you don't

00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:41,190
understand what to do to solve the

00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:45,710
problem so I think definitely no to

00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:48,510
online training so the best is to have

00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:51,660
like proper tree training in a class

00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:53,460
with people that they are experts in

00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:55,050
equality versus inclusion and consider

00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,750
bias and the other thing that I found

00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:59,790
from talking with people from HP's

00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:05,010
community it's that they would like to

00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:07,679
have like tailored trainings that

00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:10,050
concern the community's problems and not

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,390
generic equal diversity inclusion and

00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:14,790
conscious bias training that you know

00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:17,370
they have to include the problems of the

00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:21,360
community like the ones I mentioned and

00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:25,040
how to deal with those and not just

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:28,230
general yes we are all equal that's all

00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:31,860
okay I hope that helped we have one more

00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:34,020
question at the end over there I thank

00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:37,860
you for your excellent talking and

00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:44,040
rising the question it's kind of funny

00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:47,370
that see that our social concerns start

00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:50,340
clashing with each other like you need

00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:53,220
data about gender to your research but

00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:55,320
some people consider that disclosing

00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:59,880
gender is maybe some kind of

00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:05,460
discrimination and people also finds the

00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:08,340
against binary gender die define moment

00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:13,500
are accepted five genders or just you

00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:15,750
not disposal well just I think it's good

00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,090
that our concerns are are becoming so

00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,540
much that start clashing with with each

00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:21,929
other

00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:24,710
however my question it's true that is a

00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:27,270
gender imbalance across the society

00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:31,320
particularly in technical jobs

00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:33,960
particularly in IT there is some very

00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:36,150
nice initiatives like young girls by

00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:39,660
ladies that try to find that

00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:44,160
do you think that gender imbalance in

00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:47,520
HPC it's worse than in IT in general do

00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:51,120
you think that fixing contributing to

00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:54,480
gender balance in IT will automatically

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:57,090
fix a gender imbalance in HPC or it will

00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:00,180
become some sort of different field

00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:06,060
thank you and yes so as I said earlier

00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:08,490
so HPC is a niche in computing so of

00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:11,700
course he has the same problems that any

00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:14,430
other computing area but through my

00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:17,840
research I found that has two specific

00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:22,410
problems as well that it's a very closed

00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:26,490
Club as my interviewees said it and it

00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:30,170
only accepts people that they have

00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:31,920
already a background or a computational

00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:34,920
background and people that actually

00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:36,960
would like to do computational research

00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:39,720
but don't have the background for them

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:43,740
is really difficult to get in the HPC

00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:48,350
community so the training is really

00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:51,330
important to offer more training for

00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:53,520
programming training in general and how

00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:58,230
to use HPC facility specifically and

00:26:53,520 --> 00:27:01,020
then also change this image of HPC

00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:04,740
that's something really out of the world

00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:09,210
and just try to promote the uses the

00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:11,580
applications of HPC so I think HPC has

00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:15,150
to deal with those two as well as well

00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:21,240
as everything else I hope that your

00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:23,820
question yeah yeah so that's why we have

00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:26,820
women in HBC Network that's what they

00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:32,250
try to do okay we have one more question

00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:37,520
over here thank you it was amazing I'm

00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:40,290
not an HPC I'm just a developer but I've

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:45,030
also noticed that there are many women

00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:46,560
in this field and of course I personally

00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,850
would like to help with that and I've

00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,510
noticed several

00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:54,419
movements in training young women and

00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:56,970
there are also a lot of conferences and

00:27:54,419 --> 00:28:00,980
talks for us but I was wondering whether

00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:03,750
you think that these gatherings help

00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:06,210
bringing more women into the field or is

00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:08,039
just something that for us to pat

00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:11,160
ourselves on the back saying yeah good

00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:16,710
for us yeah I understand your question

00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:19,650
yeah so yeah as I said every action and

00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:21,330
every policing strategy cannot solve the

00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:27,210
problem by itself it needs to be a

00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:30,510
collaborative work we have to do all

00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:33,659
together constantly to have an actual

00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:36,510
impact so the women in vents are really

00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:39,210
good as you said for women to gather and

00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:41,640
talk with each other and help each other

00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:43,559
but as I said earlier I would like to

00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,700
see more men as well as women events

00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:46,770
because at the moment there are some

00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:49,919
women conferences and there are no men's

00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:52,409
men at all there and that really doesn't

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:56,850
help the situation because sorry to say

00:28:52,409 --> 00:29:04,250
that but mainly men are the problem in

00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:07,770
this case sorry I'm being too honest

00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:11,549
so yes so I think they're good we need

00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:13,289
to keep those but we need a lot more to

00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:17,549
happen at the same time so we can see a

00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:20,659
natural change improvement thank you and

00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:23,880
we have one more question over there

00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:26,909
thank you for your talk I caught the

00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:31,260
tail end of it really just say that one

00:29:26,909 --> 00:29:33,210
point I'm involved in teaching of the

00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:35,669
younger people and I find that there is

00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:39,000
very little difference or no difference

00:29:35,669 --> 00:29:41,610
between girls and boys in the level of

00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:45,690
interest and enthusiasm and competence

00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:47,909
in these matters a young age so I'm

00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:51,539
wondering at what age do these

00:29:47,909 --> 00:29:53,730
differences begin to manifest and also

00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:56,580
have there been studies which have been

00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:59,640
undertaken at in different regions of

00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:01,440
the world and you know is there any

00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:04,440
region of the world which is

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:10,440
more ahead than others with respect to

00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:12,600
these matters yep thank you so as I said

00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:15,509
earlier from my research I found that

00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:17,789
women that had no programming background

00:30:15,509 --> 00:30:20,399
when they actually started using

00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:23,159
programming they preferred programming

00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:26,789
they preferred computational research

00:30:23,159 --> 00:30:29,340
than lab or theory based one so that

00:30:26,789 --> 00:30:31,259
showed to me that women actually liked

00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:33,419
computing and programming so the

00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:38,009
stereotype that women are not interested

00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:40,919
in computing I don't think it exists so

00:30:38,009 --> 00:30:43,440
about the age now don't know if I'm the

00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:47,960
right person to answer that so I have

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:51,840
done some research on that but I think I

00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:54,110
think it really depends on the teachers

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:58,379
and the parents and the stereotypes that

00:30:54,110 --> 00:31:02,639
children receive from society so that

00:30:58,379 --> 00:31:05,159
applies as well to the area that you

00:31:02,639 --> 00:31:07,799
mentioned so it depends on how you grow

00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:11,039
up and what you receive from from the

00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:13,230
society you grow up so it's a little bit

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,720
of a hard question I don't think that it

00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:18,570
has been this question has been answered

00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:26,340
yet from research sorry I didn't help

00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:29,519
very much we have one question here I

00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:33,690
think many people are not aware enough

00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:37,440
of this issue and my question would be

00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:42,330
is there any advice that you would give

00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:46,740
to male developers or stem community in

00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:52,970
order to improve situation I'm so apart

00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:55,950
from being nice being nice to women and

00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:57,840
particularly women and people in general

00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:59,850
because again from my research I found

00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,190
that it's not only women that have the

00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:03,360
issue I mentioned earlier about the

00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:05,639
people that come from non-stem

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,549
backgrounds and that includes men as

00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:12,120
well that don't have computational

00:32:08,549 --> 00:32:15,070
background so if we make the computing

00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:20,340
world a little bit friendlier

00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:22,779
people that are not computing nerds oh

00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:28,600
and we changed a little bit of language

00:32:22,779 --> 00:32:31,870
we use and help them to be part of this

00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:34,480
world because I think computing is now

00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:38,409
everywhere and it's good for everyone to

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:40,539
to know how to use it how to program but

00:32:38,409 --> 00:32:43,899
apart from that again as I said earlier

00:32:40,539 --> 00:32:46,779
it's good to listen to women to attend

00:32:43,899 --> 00:32:50,980
women's event and try to understand the

00:32:46,779 --> 00:32:53,919
problem and mostly understand why do we

00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:56,220
need gender balance and how would that

00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:58,419
help them as well how would that help

00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:02,350
productivity and the project to become

00:32:58,419 --> 00:33:05,970
better and world to become better so

00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:09,580
yeah I think trying to understand and

00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:11,740
not be like okay not this again I don't

00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:13,419
want to talk about this again and it's

00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:15,419
fine and women are not interested

00:33:13,419 --> 00:33:21,029
because that's not the case

00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:21,029
thank you we have one more question

00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:27,510
thank you very much for the keynote is a

00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:29,820
really good talk it also one thing that

00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:32,730
you mentioned really um make me think

00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:35,880
like you said that we should invite men

00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:38,460
to attend women events because I'm also

00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:42,720
like me to organizers back in London and

00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:45,420
then also I organize events for like

00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:48,390
specifically is for gentlemen Ortiz in

00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:52,500
Texas ite like many women who attend

00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:54,360
there's always debate among like other

00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:57,300
organizers whether we should allow men

00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:59,580
into these events because um I have

00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:02,460
heard different feedbacks about these

00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:03,660
like for example male participant they

00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:07,560
were like oh we don't feel that

00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:10,169
comfortable like I think it's like

00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:13,350
opening a door to a different situation

00:34:10,169 --> 00:34:16,110
because we are used to like events being

00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:19,740
mainly dominated by men and then it kind

00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:21,570
of made me think that what the line we

00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:24,300
should draw in this kind of way because

00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:26,669
um because sometimes I also know that

00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:28,200
women prefer a event to be purely just

00:34:26,669 --> 00:34:30,659
like women to attend so they feel safe

00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:33,390
they feel that they won't have some kind

00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:36,330
of they say like male toxic nurse in the

00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:37,890
room or something so um yes I really

00:34:36,330 --> 00:34:40,290
make me think like where we should draw

00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:42,750
this line to to make an event that's

00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:45,870
like it's nice for everybody and but

00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:47,850
also and how empowering women to feel

00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:51,390
that they are not like a minority and

00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:53,700
weaker gender in the tech society what

00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:57,120
do you think yeah so that's that's

00:34:53,700 --> 00:35:00,210
that's really a good question and I had

00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:02,340
this exact discussion last year when I

00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:04,350
wrote that article and I said that the

00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:08,160
work actually there were a couple of men

00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:11,040
there and you were there were a couple

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:13,410
of men at being a women's event and I

00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,270
had very good discussions I I was mostly

00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:17,430
talking to mine so it was really nice

00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:20,400
because I understood what they think

00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:22,410
about it and obviously for them to be

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,770
there they seem to be interested in the

00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:28,170
topic so I found it good but then I had

00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:29,880
people sent commenting on my article and

00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:33,930
saying like oh we don't want to come to

00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:35,510
this women's events because we want

00:35:33,930 --> 00:35:37,730
women to feel comfortable

00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:39,170
as you said like oh yeah so they can

00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:41,690
talk about their stuff but their stuff

00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:43,190
is your stuff as well I mean it's it's

00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:46,310
for everyone

00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:50,570
so I my opinion is that all events

00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:53,900
should be open to everyone and now watch

00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:55,970
the language okay so I mean if you're

00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,730
nice so you don't have to go there as a

00:35:55,970 --> 00:36:00,800
crazy feminist and say yeah you toxic

00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:02,900
man we don't want you here because we

00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:06,260
want them we want them here we want them

00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:08,109
to to come and listen and we find the

00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:14,720
solution altogether

00:36:08,109 --> 00:36:16,880
thank you sorry I don't have a question

00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,350
but I wanted to give suggested reading

00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,660
for anybody who is interested in the

00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:23,270
topic so there's the this website called

00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:26,420
the heterodox Academy org and they have

00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:29,420
amazing literature review that will you

00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:32,780
are all the topics they relate to are

00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:34,970
gender differences and increased male

00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:36,380
variability hypothesis and all these

00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:38,180
elements that tend to be ignored in

00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:41,060
these discussions so very good reading

00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:45,020
okay can you say it again heterodox

00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:45,230
Academy dot org okay thank thanks thank

00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:50,950
you

00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:55,550
and one question over here no I just

00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:58,640
that regarding like the events I think

00:36:55,550 --> 00:37:01,160
it's very nice to have it open to

00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:04,580
everyone has you were saying and if you

00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:06,650
as a man feel uncomfortable in being an

00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:10,520
environment where there are many women

00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:13,490
well welcome because that's actually the

00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:16,640
first step to understand also exactly

00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:18,830
how women feel in most situations in

00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,390
which they are at most any conference

00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:25,340
because it's actually proven there's

00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:29,800
data as say someone was asking at least

00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:29,800
for the you for for Europe

00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:39,290
again say how this is distributed

00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:43,040
according to topics according to how the

00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:45,020
level of the hierarchy increases yes so

00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,060
it's actually quite balanced already at

00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:48,920
the level of PhD usually in all

00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:51,350
disciplines and then it gets worse and

00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:55,430
worse with leadership that's also the

00:37:51,350 --> 00:38:00,350
under-representation that again gets

00:37:55,430 --> 00:38:03,230
worse winny responsibilities so I think

00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:06,290
it's really good and as again another

00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:10,400
tip that was mentioned which I found I

00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:15,200
think in many situations it's not nice

00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:18,020
for say women to intervene all the time

00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:22,100
when something happens which is not

00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:25,090
correct so if your men as the tip and

00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:30,050
you assist to a situation which is

00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:34,520
unfair or which again you notice that

00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:36,350
shouldn't happen I think or I mean read

00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:40,960
and I would like to hear your opinion on

00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:43,850
that that what you could do as a man is

00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:47,180
to intervene but to intervene not to

00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:49,190
defend or protect the woman but to

00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:52,220
address the person who is behaving

00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:54,800
incorrectly and demonstrate and show and

00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:57,260
explain to that person why that is

00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:00,530
incorrect so it's not about defending

00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:03,890
the woman but it's to intervene in place

00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:06,650
also of the women on the data on what's

00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:09,860
happening and on why that situation

00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:12,170
should not just take place yeah that's I

00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:13,880
totally agree and that's what we need to

00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:16,900
learn at those equality diversity

00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:19,550
inclusion trainings this is this kind of

00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:23,390
situations like examples and case

00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:25,220
studies of how we can act and react when

00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:33,350
something like this happened thank you

00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:35,480
for this and I've heard of many programs

00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:38,140
where they were specifically looking for

00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:41,950
women to mentor

00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:44,750
girls or young women do you know

00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:47,990
anything of the impact of mentoring

00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:50,960
programs depending on the mantas being

00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:54,410
male or female is it better to have a

00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:58,609
female mentor for girls or young women

00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:58,880
or is it good to have a male mentor as

00:39:58,609 --> 00:40:02,589
well

00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:05,480
mm-hmm yes that's a good question so

00:40:02,589 --> 00:40:08,450
from my experience and through my

00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,760
research I found that women prefer to

00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:12,650
have women mentors because obviously

00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:15,980
they can understand better their

00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:16,910
problems now if they can help them with

00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:21,200
the problems

00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:24,560
I don't know but usually that's the case

00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:26,720
so my opinion is it would be good to

00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:32,210
have men mentor male mentors as well

00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:37,579
especially senior senior staff male

00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:41,480
members because it is good to bring them

00:40:37,579 --> 00:40:44,569
together with young female to to show

00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:47,150
them to guide them better I think so how

00:40:44,569 --> 00:40:50,300
to get to a leadership position because

00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:54,109
usually men are have more leadership

00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:56,240
positions but I'm not sure if I don't

00:40:54,109 --> 00:40:58,640
think there is any study yet that shows

00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:01,490
that that's better or worse I'm not sure

00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:04,310
about that and so I have I had a women

00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:09,589
mentor and she helped me a lot so my

00:41:04,310 --> 00:41:13,280
experience it's not helpful so yeah but

00:41:09,589 --> 00:41:16,010
also about mentoring is really important

00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,740
to understand the the difference between

00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:21,740
formal and informal mentoring because

00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:23,300
sometimes we confuse formal mentoring as

00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:27,500
you said you mentioned that there is a

00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:30,849
specific program that run from the

00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:33,500
company or the institution you work and

00:41:30,849 --> 00:41:34,760
usually people do that again as they do

00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,770
they call them diversity inclusion

00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,079
trainings like taking the box and not

00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:41,030
really caring so I I from my experience

00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:43,160
again I think that informal training

00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:46,970
that finding someone that you think that

00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:49,820
that someone can help you it doesn't

00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:52,430
matter if it's men or men or women

00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:55,460
that problem is more helpful than the

00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:55,870
formal program mentoring programs thank

00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:58,370
you

00:41:55,870 --> 00:42:04,100
do we have more questions for our

00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:07,160
speaker today well if we don't have any

00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:09,080
further questions let's have a very very

00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:14,020
warm applause for Athena

00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:14,020
