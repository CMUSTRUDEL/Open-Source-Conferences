By Adriana Dorneles

How recommendation engines are taking part in our daily routine and how companies as Netflix and Amazon implement it?
This talk aims to show the elements that compound a recommendation engine to people who have never been in touch with the matter or want to know a bit more. At the end of this session, you might be able to reproduce your own recommendation system and also know where to find more about it.

Talk structure: 
1. What is and why use a recommendation engine? 
2. Recommendation engine importance 
3. Steps of a recommendation 
4. Recommendation algorithms 
5. Basic Statistics for distance and correlation 
6. Example

00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:18,720
you talk to this amount of people so I'm

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,849
kind of nervous and anxious thank you

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,529

00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:28,310
amazing experience thank you very much

00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:31,859
so today I'm going to talk about

00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:37,650
recommendation engines and how to build

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:40,320
one simple recommendation algorithm but

00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:43,860
first if you don't mind I would like to

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:49,080
give you some context about me and also

00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:52,200
break the ice so I came from I come from

00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:55,230
Brazil with the ass actually I know that

00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:59,430
you know frizzy with the Z but we write

00:00:55,230 --> 00:01:03,330
it with the S we have more than 8,000

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:06,710
square kilometers of extension and it

00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:13,140
borders like ten countries this is a

00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:20,130
huge but I come from the very south of

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:22,140
Brazil I will show you this is the Hugh

00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:25,319
Grant you do so so a little bit about

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,579
Brazil where language is the Portuguese

00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:31,979
I don't know if I have another

00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:35,310
Brazilians here oh nice nice to see you

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:39,679
Portuguese have London landed a bit more

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:43,740
than five hundred five hundred years ago

00:01:39,679 --> 00:01:46,229
we have thirty years of a week much

00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:50,130
democracy and I don't know if you heard

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:53,179
but we kind of are having coupe des

00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:58,859
tartes and coupe des tartes all the time

00:01:53,179 --> 00:02:00,209
we have unlimited not so well and how

00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:05,520
how are you

00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:08,069
is boy to the way well so from the very

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,009
south of Brazil its abridge the zoo we

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:16,110
like Suhas go into my home we don't have

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:20,590
much of Samba neither the warm weather

00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:24,910
we bored Argentina and Uruguay we are

00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:27,629
full of playing fields so we use it very

00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:32,200
much for agriculture and cattle breeding

00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:37,360
our daily temperature can vary from 28

00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:39,370
to 10 degrees in the same day and the

00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:44,200
most traditional thing we haven't even

00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:48,459
aged DUSU is ever my TT it's called

00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:53,519
Shima ho so this thing in the ladies

00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:58,290
hand is the Shema hoe you can see a very

00:02:53,519 --> 00:03:03,480
huge piece of meat that is being cooked

00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:06,190
by the fire that is under the ground so

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,579
I don't know I don't know if you have

00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:12,760
heard about my home but I don't know why

00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:16,630
maybe it's because it has caffeine some

00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:23,410
footballers have been drinking it like

00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:25,799
the England's footballers and Messi he's

00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:29,500
Argentinean right you know that Brazil

00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:31,870
Argentinians have some struggles and

00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:34,690
this is her now Jing you know you should

00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:37,510
also drinking tomorrow he's from Porto

00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:41,560
Alegre as well and the curious thing is

00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:45,430
it's a hot beverage and we drink it on

00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:49,359
the beach in the hot weather it doesn't

00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:53,350
matter it doesn't matter you like it so

00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:57,690
this is me I'm a developer I'm economist

00:03:53,350 --> 00:04:00,700
I'm doing a master degree in statistics

00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:05,470
so I'm a dating Tuesday as I'm a cat

00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:08,739
person and I am addicted to travel this

00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:10,840
was me my first travel talking about how

00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:15,000
to do deal with the first age

00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:18,459
frustration at not of not having your

00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,160
hypothesis proven as a data scientist I

00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:24,880
don't know if I have data science here

00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:27,290
but sometimes we spend like days trying

00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,740
to prove a hypothesis

00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:34,100
and it doesn't happen like we went but

00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:37,100
the thing is that even if it's not a

00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:41,870
good I parties I mean it's not accepted

00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:44,240
we can gather information of this so

00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:48,610
yeah this is was in the human in data

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:53,930
science okay let's go what about

00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:57,170
recommendation system so the key word

00:04:53,930 --> 00:05:01,160
for recommendation systems are revenue

00:04:57,170 --> 00:05:07,640
and customer engagement what happen is

00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:10,430
that we as customers are overloaded with

00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:15,380
information so we have a lot of items

00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:18,350
out there a lot of movies to watch a lot

00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:20,510
of I don't know videos and we don't know

00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:22,580
what to watch sometimes or we don't know

00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:27,220
what to buy sometimes what is the best

00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:29,890
for us so we have a lot of information

00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:33,160
this is a very new personnel

00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:37,780
personalized way of selling buying

00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:42,890
watching and getting to know things and

00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:47,330
well McNee said that this it helps

00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:52,840
groups of user or users to select items

00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:59,930
from a crowded item or information space

00:05:52,840 --> 00:06:03,230
well Amazon YouTube Netflix I mean there

00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:08,930
is a lot of others like udemy Google oh

00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:13,250
my god almost every website where every

00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:18,530
ecommerce uses it but just to bring some

00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:23,600
examples for Amazon in a quarter they

00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:27,410
had almost almost 13 billion dollars of

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:30,140
revenue and this was the first first

00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:33,410
quarter they implemented the

00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:37,460
recommendation engine and they had 30

00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:40,820
billion and it was 30 percent more than

00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:46,250
the same quarter of the last

00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:50,360
year so for YouTube users and for

00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:53,930
YouTube more than 70% of the user

00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,640
consumption come from recommendations so

00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:59,960
when you were watching a video and

00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:02,960
there's another video coming or you go

00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:07,220
through the feet and there's some videos

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:10,070
recommended for you almost 10% of the

00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:16,340
consumption of YouTube is about this and

00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:19,850
for Netflix 75% of the consumption comes

00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:27,970
from recommendation so we can see it's a

00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:31,100
very big matter recommendations so when

00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:34,930
we need to recommend something we might

00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:38,660
be looking for answer to problems

00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:42,800
prediction and rating there is an

00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:45,920
approach for recommendation that use it

00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:49,310
that is being used that it has not

00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:53,210
artificial intelligence that is like oh

00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:56,300
the most sold the most click 'add items

00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:59,210
that it appears and it can be easily

00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:04,160
made with a query in the database and

00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:11,140
showing the user what items has having

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:15,050
more so than everything but what we want

00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:18,740
to have is things that the customers are

00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:23,300
likely to loved are likely to buy are

00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:26,330
likely to watch so we just we don't need

00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:31,150
just to predicted rating for an item but

00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:35,840
either if they might like it or not okay

00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:41,840
little bug there but we how do you get

00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:46,850
this data right so data is the key and

00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:49,160
we have two kinds of data I'm saying two

00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:52,190
kinds because I'm separated that way I

00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:54,710
don't know maybe we have more even more

00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:57,279
than we haven't talked about but

00:08:54,710 --> 00:09:01,400
we can put everything in this two

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:04,460
categories so implicit data it's about

00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:08,240
tracing it's about the data that the

00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:14,980
customer didn't give to us like their

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:18,320
name or address but where did they click

00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:20,570
what kind of movie they like and

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:25,339
something like this we can collect this

00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:29,210
data right big data and we have the

00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:31,490
explicit data this is the more difficult

00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:34,510
to get because it depends on an action

00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:38,180
of the user so answering a survey or

00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:40,790
rating items I don't know I think I have

00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:45,380
never rated an item I don't know about

00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:47,960
you but it's it's it's not common I mean

00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:52,130
think for the people who rates because

00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:57,350
I'm always going to the rating then yeah

00:09:52,130 --> 00:10:02,900
I have never so this is the basic models

00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:04,430
of record recommendation systems with a

00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:08,120
a a I okay

00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:10,490
so we have the content based the color

00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:15,040
the collaborative and the hybrid

00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:19,310
solutions I mean this companies like

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:23,420
Amazon Netflix YouTube they are using

00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:26,450
more hybrid solutions that is very based

00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:30,230
on the content but it's very based on

00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:34,190
the collaborative and has some secrets

00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:37,880
of the recipe that we don't know so

00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:40,490
content based the recommendations are

00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:45,140
based on the description of the item or

00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:50,390
in the synopsis or in the jury or even

00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:53,589
in the author there is um there is a an

00:10:50,390 --> 00:11:00,250
article in the internet showing that an

00:10:53,589 --> 00:11:04,520
author had launched the book like in

00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:08,360
2010 and the book was not very good sold

00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:12,459
that's okay in 2015 and

00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:16,250
not the author launched another book but

00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:19,850
the content was very similar to this one

00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:25,940
that was has been launched in 2010 and

00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:29,209
what happened was that the book that was

00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:32,529
launched in 2010 it started to have a

00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:36,890
lot of people buying and buying it and

00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:40,790
dowser was like oh what's happening then

00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:42,680
tracing it back they have seen that

00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:48,260
because of this book that was very

00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:56,649
similar to the 2010 book it starts to

00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:59,390
sell you more so it happened so

00:11:56,649 --> 00:12:02,120
content-based recommender systems are

00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:05,329
born for date from the idea of using the

00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:09,070
content of each item for recommending

00:12:05,329 --> 00:12:11,779
purpose it avoids the cold start

00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:15,170
recommendation problem wait for it I'm

00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:19,880
going to talk about it and content

00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:23,060
representations I open up two options to

00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:25,940
be used with different approaches like

00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:29,920
Janelle or Texas text processing

00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:37,040
techniques semantic information it has a

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:43,220
whole world - of tools - to analyze this

00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:47,600
data so another one is the collaborative

00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:51,199
and it's memory based recommendations so

00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:54,610
in this case are based on user social

00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:58,430
interaction and rankings provider

00:12:54,610 --> 00:13:02,260
provided by other users this

00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:06,310
collaborative model is called

00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:13,339
collaborative filtering and it's divided

00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:18,770
by user based and item based so let's

00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:19,670
see this problem it's Saturday night I

00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:23,060
am

00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:26,750
Tom I opened my favorite streaming app

00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:29,360
and I don't know what watch I don't know

00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:33,070
but I know my friend Marta

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:37,250
she likes thriller and drama so do I

00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:41,600
maybe it's a good idea to ask her for a

00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:44,630
movie recommendation and this is the

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,930
truth okay Marta is my friend I didn't

00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:49,520
know what watch and I was oh my god I'm

00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:50,300
always like this I don't know if I

00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,370
believe it

00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:56,090
we live in this kind of thing but I'm

00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:58,430
Germany and I can make decisions so yeah

00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:02,210
I was like oh my god what I'm going to

00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:07,000
watch so I'm showing you the user based

00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:11,540
filtering this on top is my friend Harry

00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,910
he likes orange grapes raspberry and

00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:18,890
banana Martha

00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:23,900
likes grapes and Danny likes grapes and

00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:26,750
banana maybe Martha could like orange or

00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:30,710
banana or raspberry and she never have

00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:37,360
tasted it maybe I can recommend her but

00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:41,000
looking at this picture I can see that

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,370
Danny is more similar to Emery because

00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:47,330
she likes more fruits maybe Martha just

00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:50,270
like grapes and if she likes more fruits

00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:56,020
and she is more similar to Henry maybe I

00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:56,020
can recommend her oranges and raspberry

00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:06,980
well but what about the item based

00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:09,140
filtering the thing is again every likes

00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:15,520
the same fruit smart as well and then as

00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:20,990
well but if I go and check the items I

00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:25,850
see that more people like banana maybe I

00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:29,170
can recommend Marta a banana and maybe

00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:29,170
she likes it

00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:39,829
so it has been shown shown in the market

00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:44,389
the collaborative filtering more

00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:47,869
accurate than the content-based it's

00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:50,929
easy to implement but sometimes it's not

00:15:47,869 --> 00:15:54,980
a good idea to implement we have to keep

00:15:50,929 --> 00:15:57,199
it in mind when is not a good idea when

00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:59,480
we don't have enough knowledge about the

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:02,029
item and the user so we don't have

00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:05,779
enough ratings I don't know nothing

00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:11,749
about what user I can't do the math to

00:16:05,779 --> 00:16:14,929
see with what user or item this user is

00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:18,439
more similar so how can I recommend

00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:22,069
something and when the item has not been

00:16:18,439 --> 00:16:25,029
ranked enough so it's a new item and I

00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:29,329
don't have any formation of this so a

00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:31,639
problem code start code start at as I

00:16:29,329 --> 00:16:36,379
have said before and now I will explain

00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:39,920
is the expression we use when we don't

00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:42,319
have much information about the user and

00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:46,549
would like to recommend them something I

00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:50,360
think that helps on the code start is I

00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:52,009
don't know if you have Netflix or there

00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:54,589
are another size like this like

00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:58,160
Pinterest you go for the first time

00:16:54,589 --> 00:17:03,709
there you do your registration and the

00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:07,370
website asks you to select items that

00:17:03,709 --> 00:17:11,959
you like more or gems like that you like

00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:15,110
more so this helps the algorithm to

00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:19,370
recommend you things and avoid avoid the

00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:22,250
code start so it sparsity that is the

00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:26,659
problem when we don't have much number

00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:28,940
of ratings and new items because you

00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:31,309
don't have information so that there

00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:33,649
it's not a good idea when we don't have

00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:38,679
any information because this

00:17:33,649 --> 00:17:38,679
collaborative filtering is very based on

00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:46,760
similarity similarity calculations

00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:52,400
so let's build our own recommendin

00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:56,660
system algorithm this is these are the

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:59,570
steps to the basic steps to be break to

00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:04,250
build a recommendation system so first

00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:06,170
we need to talk we might choose how to

00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:11,510
do the math to find a similarity

00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:14,540
coefficient between users then we have

00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:17,510
to predict so we have to find the

00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:21,110
predicted score for the movies that the

00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:23,300
user didn't watch and tell so let the

00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:27,380
user know what you have predicted to

00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:32,170
them so recommend it so let's go back to

00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:35,090
my problem Saturday night I went to

00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:40,010
watch a movie I don't know what to do

00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:42,070
so maybe our asks Martha but may I try

00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:45,500
another friend

00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:48,620
the thing is I have this database and I

00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:51,470
as I said its truth my friends gave me

00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:55,940
these ratings it's good because now we

00:18:51,470 --> 00:19:00,370
know how similar we are and how to get

00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:03,140
recommendations so this is our database

00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:08,210
let me see if I can have a pointer here

00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:11,720
okay so the wolf of Wall Street Danny

00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:15,980
hasn't watch it Cool Runnings I didn't

00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:20,450
baby driver neither Danny as well didn't

00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:24,110
watch the coroners every didn't watch

00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:32,660
babe driver and ultra didn't watch the

00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:36,550
Lord of the Rings so let dude the cow to

00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:41,360
choose to see the similarity between us

00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:45,230
what I have done here is I have plot a

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:49,570
two dimension graph of the wolf of Wall

00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:55,200
Street and the Devil Wears Prada and I

00:19:49,570 --> 00:20:00,960
seen how the data is dispersed so here

00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:04,320
I can see that Marta gave a 3 rating for

00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,600
the other Devil Wears Prada and three

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:13,760
for the wolf of the Wall Street

00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:18,500
I gave four and four and Phillip gave

00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:23,880
three for the Devil Wears Prada and four

00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:29,630
450 for the wolf a straight when I see

00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:33,530
this graph and I try to to to to

00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:37,050
understand who is closer to me because

00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:39,750
I'm trying to get the similarity here so

00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:44,400
when we talk about data similarity is

00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:47,460
much about where are we together what

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:50,760
points or data points we share and

00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:53,280
things like it like this so when I want

00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:57,150
to recommend something to anyone I want

00:20:53,280 --> 00:21:00,240
I really want to recommend to someone

00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:03,800
that is very similar to me so I know

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:10,110
that this person is going to like it so

00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:16,830
thinking about it I can try to measure

00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:20,190
the distance so from Philip I am 0.5

00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:25,250
distant and from ootah

00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:29,610
well this is a triangle so let's do the

00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:33,840
hypotenuse doing the Pythagorean so do

00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:38,130
you remember that from school so yeah we

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:43,560
get the distance of this casino and this

00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:47,280
one then we can doing the square of

00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:52,230
those summing up and the square root we

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:57,570
get the I potenuse so doing this math I

00:21:52,230 --> 00:22:00,270
know that I'm 0 71 distant from ohta

00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:03,930
so I'm more distant to altar than to

00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:08,550
Philip this is the okk lydian distance

00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:09,059
this is also a math that is used for the

00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:13,139
cane

00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:15,240
nearest neighbor this is very used

00:22:13,139 --> 00:22:19,470
algorithm in machine learning

00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:22,440
I would I would just show this formula

00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:25,499
but I thought that if I showed you the

00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:28,499
triangle and the Pythagoras it will be

00:22:25,499 --> 00:22:31,700
easier because I don't think people like

00:22:28,499 --> 00:22:34,860
symbols characters and numbers

00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:38,220
exponential everything together so this

00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:40,950
is just the Pythagoras with summing up

00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:43,740
everything with all dimensions we have

00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:46,980
because I have showed you the two

00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:50,190
dimensional graph but if I haven't a lot

00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:54,210
of movies out you have a lot of

00:22:50,190 --> 00:23:03,539
dimensions so this is how we are going

00:22:54,210 --> 00:23:05,360
to make the similarity calculation if I

00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:09,360
do

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:13,230
function name similarity get similar

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:18,179
sorry I did this I will show you the

00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:23,730
code and it shows that regarding our

00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:26,600
movies I'm more similar to ootah then to

00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:26,600
everyone else

00:23:26,869 --> 00:23:38,549
so let's predict the prediction is that

00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:40,139
I have to predict what is going to be my

00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:44,429
waiting for Cool Runnings

00:23:40,139 --> 00:23:47,369
and for webdriver because maybe that the

00:23:44,429 --> 00:23:54,960
movie I'm gonna see tonight actually in

00:23:47,369 --> 00:24:00,179
Saturday so here we can see that we

00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:05,220
don't have much ratings I mean like four

00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:09,840
of those more plus mine are missing so

00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:13,049
what if like at a view that is the most

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:19,649
similar to me like here like we'll see

00:24:13,049 --> 00:24:22,379
here hadn't waited movies let's suppose

00:24:19,649 --> 00:24:23,570
that we have like 50 movies not just

00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:26,940
five

00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:29,990
what if a person appreciate a movie that

00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:33,120
everyone else have low rated it a

00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:36,240
solution to this problem is to use the

00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:41,030
weighted average so let's go to the

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,030
Saturday night like movie should I watch

00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:49,740
protip it's up to us to choose what is

00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:53,730
the recommendation threshold we have

00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:57,180
this method the dis eristic method that

00:24:53,730 --> 00:25:00,840
is to get my average rating and just

00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:06,050
recommend if the prediction is higher

00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:12,180
than my average rating so

00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:15,680
recommendations for me here is the code

00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:21,200
I have done for the recommendation this

00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:24,300
measures the Euclidean distance and

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:28,860
multiplies for the similarity for the

00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:32,640
waited for the weighted average so here

00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:38,070
what happen is I have put the similarity

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:41,850
here sorry the predictions we have Danny

00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:43,350
hasn't predict the hasn't rated Cool

00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:50,250
Runnings

00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:57,840
so it's blank and I have multiplied this

00:25:50,250 --> 00:26:01,830
two to get the weighted rank and in the

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:07,140
end we get a prediction for the Cool

00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:12,150
Runnings for example for me I would rate

00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:16,290
Cool Runnings as 3.6 at least the

00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:25,010
algorithm says that and the same thing

00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:28,710
for webdriver I would rate it as 3.93 so

00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:30,810
here's the let me see here yeah this is

00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:34,590
the function of the recommendation and

00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:36,480
this is the output so as we have seen I

00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:39,630
would recommend

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:44,220
more of a driver than Cool Runnings what

00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:48,740
does it mean that I may be recommended

00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:51,809
with webdriver by the algorithm so I

00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:57,450
should tell my users

00:26:51,809 --> 00:27:01,559
what is the predicted here doing the
