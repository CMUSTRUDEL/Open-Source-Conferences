By Katherine Kampf

Ever wondered what breed that dog or cat is? Let’s build a pet detector service to recognize them in pictures! In this talk, we will walk through the training, optimizing, and deploying of a deep learning model using Azure Notebooks. We will use transfer learning to retrain a MobileNet model using TensorFlow to recognize dog and cat breeds using the Oxford IIIT Pet Dataset. Next, we’ll optimize the model and tune our hyperparameters to improve the model accuracy. Finally, we will deploy the model as a web service in. Come to learn how you can quickly create accurate image recognition models with a few simple techniques!
