	"Do we have a diversity problem in Python community?
[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-10 - PyCharm]
[Basel, CH]

By Cheuk Ho

The diversity statement quoted as follows: “The Python Software Foundation and the global Python community welcome and encourage participation by everyone. Our community is based on mutual respect, tolerance, and encouragement, and we are working to help each other live up to these principles. We want our community to be more diverse: whoever you are, and whatever your background, we welcome you.”

Diversity, big deal! As an active members and event organisers (and also on the minority side of the gender) in the Python community, we have alway been concern by the question of: Do we truly have a problem in diversity? Especially, gender diversity. We would like to find out the truth, by data science, and see if we can find a clue why and how we can fix it.

First, we will show the research others did regarding the representation of women in the R and Python communities [1]. Then, we will show the research that we did based on our experience and statistic. Including static analysis of the speakers diversity (regarding gender) at major PyCon and PyData conferences. Finally, as we all care about diversity and want improvements, we would like to find out the reason and what we can do about it. We would propose what we, the minorities and allies, could do against this seemingly unbalance situation and make the community better.

This talk is for all that who cares about diversity in our community.

thank you very much yeah

00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:12,519
so thank you for coming in this room I

00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:14,110
think I can assume that everybody in

00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:17,580
this room and also if you're watching

00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:19,120
the livestream you care about diversity

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:22,090
especially in the Python community

00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:24,820
that's why you're here with me so thank

00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:28,630
you so much for that you can keep the

00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:30,850
discussion with me on Twitter is welcome

00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:33,579
I would totally to be about me so thanks

00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:36,579
for introducing me I am I currently live

00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:39,730
in London as a data scientist in London

00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:41,949
I am proactive in doing a lot of stuff I

00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:43,629
try to because I love the community I

00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:46,390
want to contribute more

00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:48,699
so I Corgan eyes some meetups including

00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:51,850
the AI code for gender minorities I'm so

00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:56,019
glad to have to co-organizers here with

00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:58,870
me Europe - I'm so happy I love them all

00:00:56,019 --> 00:01:02,409
so I organized some sprints which is

00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:05,800
mainly to be focusing on contribute to

00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:09,430
open source so so far we have Sprint's

00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:12,460
once per month and so almost once per

00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:14,740
month so it's a it's fun time I love

00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:16,869
doing it and also I myself contribute to

00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,670
a lot of open-source libraries it's a

00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:20,170
small contribution but I think everybody

00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:23,619
can do it if I can do it you can do it

00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:26,890
all so I created this a pixel mix thank

00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:28,960
you so much I have some a designer I

00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:33,070
hope I pronounced is her name correct is

00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,299
active yeah yeah this designer created

00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,369
this logo for me thank you so much

00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:39,039
that's about almost authorised like

00:01:36,369 --> 00:01:43,869
everybody contribute so ok enough for

00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:47,500
open-source so so a couple of months ago

00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:51,399
I found this blog post which kind of

00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:54,399
kind of get my attention why women are

00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:59,049
forcing in our community but lacking in

00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:01,929
Python so myself my background as a data

00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:05,020
scientist I started when I started to

00:02:01,929 --> 00:02:07,749
you know doing data science I was using

00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:10,479
how but for different reasons I switched

00:02:07,749 --> 00:02:14,080
to Python and from there I know that the

00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:16,300
Python community is lovely and let that

00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,030
come to my like I think about

00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:21,519
why we have this problem because the

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:24,519
private communities lovely like why we

00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:27,010
like women and not enjoying Python as

00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:33,280
much as ours so mmm I need to have a

00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:36,940
look so we see that actually we have

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:39,459
more than like six time more Python

00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,890
users then there are users according to

00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:46,810
the Stack Overflow survey last year in

00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:48,370
2018 so but there's a lot of people

00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:51,340
using Python right - it's lovely you

00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:54,900
know the community is lovely but we only

00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:58,269
have one point two five times more

00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,160
members in PI ladies than our ladies so

00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:02,920
what happened is it really like we don't

00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:06,879
have that much you know female Python

00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:10,390
users or female - uses not active in the

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:13,510
community it's like numbers doesn't

00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:16,269
match and then also something worrying

00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:18,220
is like for contributors again like I

00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:21,489
contribute to open source I would love

00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:23,920
to do more and then but why our has four

00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:26,290
times more female contributor than

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,780
Python also we are lacking in presence

00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:31,720
in the in the you know in contribution

00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:36,430
to open source in Python community oh no

00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:39,459
it's not good also for networks so I

00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:42,069
said mister organizer there is like our

00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:45,340
ladies is this 120 chapters in 40

00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:48,069
countries everywhere but in hi ladies we

00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:52,419
have last we have only 45 chapters

00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:54,010
active chapters in 12 countries so I'm

00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:56,290
very lucky I mean one of the biggest

00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:59,349
city in Europe in London we have PI

00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:02,440
ladies and I know that like there's also

00:03:59,349 --> 00:04:04,690
ha ladies remote which is you know it's

00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,340
a remote is for everybody who's like in

00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:07,900
the city that isn't you know a smaller

00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:10,900
city that doesn't have a high ladies

00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,700
take enjoy but still like its liking it

00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:16,150
would be great if like we have more and

00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:17,919
more police chatter over women to to

00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,959
network to you know feel that they are

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,729
not the minorities they're not alone

00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,010
they they are also important in the

00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:29,199
private community so it's like mmm there

00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:32,439
are problems there also

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:35,080
it could be the problem is it's not like

00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:37,150
a problem that you know that somebody

00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,680
you want to make right yes because there

00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,990
may be a fundamental problem that you

00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,020
know the users if you think about the

00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:47,080
users right for our I keep you know

00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,729
having different people they have like

00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,590
maybe that's the tissues they come from

00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:52,840
an academic background they say oh oh

00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,669
it's amazing it's so easy to use and all

00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,289
these I was a but partly it's also

00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:56,999
amazing and easy to use have you heard

00:04:56,289 --> 00:05:00,430
about that

00:04:56,999 --> 00:05:04,000
so there's actually statistic that is

00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:06,360
showing that actually most Python users

00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,349
they actually maybe from a more

00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:12,909
engineering computer science background

00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:14,830
maybe you know most most students in

00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:16,539
computer science that maybe when they

00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:19,479
were in university they learn you know

00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:22,719
using C++ I my first computer courses

00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:26,199
that you know I attend in university was

00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:27,999
actually using C++ and also Python now

00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:30,490
it's getting more and more popular this

00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:33,520
morning you know Martin mentioned that

00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,589
in parcel there's the Python in

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,259
education is like now they're teaching

00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:39,610
Python you schools so yeah maybe come in

00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:42,939
science students they have a lot of

00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:45,339
exposure in using Python but for for

00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:48,009
people students that you know maybe that

00:05:45,339 --> 00:05:52,469
discipline is like more like you know

00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:55,990
math or or social science or even like

00:05:52,469 --> 00:05:57,759
economies the economics or even like

00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:59,379
journalism because nowadays the

00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:04,330
journalism is a thing right they may be

00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:07,089
using our instead of Python so so yeah

00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:09,490
that's that's a really like a difference

00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:14,430
demographic in in the to to language

00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:19,569
users and we can also see that because

00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:22,599
yeah because so different disciplines we

00:06:19,569 --> 00:06:24,789
can see the computer science in computer

00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:27,250
science graduates especially in the

00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:32,589
Western world it's mainly male-dominated

00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:34,779
they're like you know you just you can

00:06:32,589 --> 00:06:37,089
see like for these likes that statistic

00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:38,620
majors they're like more or less you

00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:41,080
know there's a half and half this like

00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:42,110
forty four percent women but for

00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,889
communal science

00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:47,720
only 19% it's like oh maybe we should

00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:49,550
think about getting more girls to study

00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,610
computer science maybe that's the thing

00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:55,909
so um yeah there's also like million

00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:59,900
questions that we have to have to attack

00:06:55,909 --> 00:07:05,469
have to answer to help that the

00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:08,599
diversity also I have seen this um this

00:07:05,469 --> 00:07:15,020
Jew with a notebook that actually I can

00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:18,800
show you the notebook yeah okay the

00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:22,000
Internet's slow at the moment okay can

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:26,030
you see that yeah right

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,340
so if you mean so this notebook is very

00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:31,580
very good actually the first time I came

00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:34,580
across it is was um in kind of I joined

00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,900
a non focused EIS see you know mailing

00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,789
lists and then they were circulating

00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,889
this to be the notebook because what

00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:43,009
they talk about is about the inequality

00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:46,039
in the leadership in um focused projects

00:07:43,009 --> 00:07:47,840
yeah pie data leadership is like oh it's

00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:49,400
like an inequality of you know

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,860
underrepresented groups and then they

00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,969
use a very scientific way I won't show

00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,770
you the details I would have a lot of

00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:56,870
slides so you can you know check it out

00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:58,909
yourself and they made this notebook you

00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:00,800
know and I'm thinking about maybe I

00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:04,219
could change this data so Jason and I

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,319
can do different research so this is the

00:08:04,219 --> 00:08:07,819
result right and maybe I should switch

00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,690
back to the slide so it's easier to see

00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:17,930
so they use that scientific method to

00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:20,120
show that is how how diverse is each

00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,770
project so these are non focused

00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,500
projects I think this statistic is done

00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:27,139
in Russia so there's some like new ones

00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:31,969
that is not updated but anyway um so you

00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:34,760
can see that the inequality is like it's

00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:37,550
going to be actually how to look at this

00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:41,050
is like if it's lower if you have a

00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:44,510
lower score like interact they are very

00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:48,320
they a more diverse so you can see that

00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:51,079
numpy pie MC free they have not very

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,240
diverse and I think these ones are the

00:08:51,079 --> 00:08:55,490
ones that yeah they got a score this one

00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,190
so the uniqueness is one so

00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:02,600
they have only one gender as the main

00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:05,360
you know um contributor so so which

00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:08,620
gender I think is quite obvious and easy

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,960
to guess so you can see like from these

00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:14,330
from the bottom ones a more more eco on

00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:16,460
and you can see like our own sizing in

00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:19,010
head you know like some you know open

00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,960
general sale like oh you can see that

00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:22,760
there's actually like a domain

00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:26,090
difference as well like maybe things

00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:30,020
down more numeric more on you know maybe

00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:33,140
physics related to have the less you

00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:37,790
know um diverse so yeah that's very

00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:39,860
interesting and also in that Jupiter

00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,210
notebook I mentioned one idea which i

00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:45,080
think is very very good

00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:48,470
it's active and passive diversity

00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:51,830
problems so active diversity problem

00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:55,250
means that there are people or group of

00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:57,550
members that they are toxic they don't

00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:00,800
want the community to be diverse and

00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:02,870
passive means that actually nobody wants

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:07,280
it but if nobody's do anything to it

00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:13,010
then it's the fundamental bias in it in

00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:15,800
the inequality so I think it's my

00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:18,290
opinion that the plasma community is

00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:19,820
having a passive problem I haven't

00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:22,400
encountered any actual problem in the

00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:24,070
Python community very luckily I yeah I

00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,690
think that's that's even worse

00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:29,060
maybe so like the other thing is like

00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:32,170
maybe in work space we could we have a

00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:36,620
chance to you know face some active

00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:38,480
diversity problem but in the community I

00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:43,520
think so far my experience mainly

00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:45,410
passive problem so yeah so that means

00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:52,670
that we have to do something to improve

00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:54,380
it okay so the the the previous

00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:57,050
information that I gave you is mainly

00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:59,480
based on a purpose I see and then also

00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:00,860
like I saw and then also attribute

00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:03,670
enough focus on what they did which is

00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:08,600
amazing so I try to do something myself

00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:12,480
this is the research that I did

00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,920
refer to last year so I'm thinking about

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,290
because I have been to attend

00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:19,590
conferences last year very luckily I

00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:21,570
enjoy every single one of them but is

00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:24,030
there imbalance of gender ratio in

00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:25,680
Python conferences because you can like

00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:28,020
I think it's quite obvious if you have a

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,240
coffee break if you go to the the

00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,970
toilets here the venue is lovely you

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,100
know it's very big so maybe this less

00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:37,320
obvious but if you a smaller venue you

00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,060
can see that usually you know outside of

00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,430
me a toilet have a long queue and a

00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:45,930
female toilet is like I can go in like

00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:48,330
empty and oh it's good in that sense but

00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:53,160
maybe it means that it's not good in

00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:57,090
diversity so oh yeah so I try to do

00:11:53,160 --> 00:12:00,060
something I try to see is there like

00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:02,010
imbalance like how like always obviously

00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:04,770
they may there's obviously like any

00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:07,380
imbalance but how imbalances is it's

00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:09,030
difficult to conduct the the participant

00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,380
because I talk to people but I can't

00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:13,800
talk to every single one of the

00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:16,740
participant so ok was the easiest way to

00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,300
to to to to to count it's like oh maybe

00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:21,620
I should count the speakers because all

00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:26,310
talks are recorded so it's very easy and

00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:30,000
but I have to really say that this is

00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:31,560
not very accurate reason being not all

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,330
talks are recorded because some speaker

00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:36,690
they may prefer it not to be recorded

00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:39,420
also for the gender of the speaker I

00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:41,220
didn't really do a research of like you

00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:43,590
know researching on every single speaker

00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,540
and they male female or non-binary um I

00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:50,190
just based on the pronoun that maybe the

00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:52,860
chair used to describe them so it's yeah

00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:55,170
if I made mistake that's that's

00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,900
difficult to avoid but um I hope this

00:12:55,170 --> 00:13:02,220
gives a general idea of how imbalance it

00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:05,640
is so this is the statistic oh is clear

00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:09,390
enough um so you can see that oh like

00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:12,030
the blue blue bars are male and the red

00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:16,230
bars are non male so including FEMA and

00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:20,570
non-binary speakers so except like on UK

00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:24,050
there is 75% speakers of marrow

00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:27,440
they are doing very well but which means

00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:32,150
that there isn't enough non male

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:34,550
speakers and wise is it because when the

00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:37,150
coffers open there is like a lot of mail

00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:39,950
submission just this year I mean the

00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:41,960
programming workgroup of Europe - and I

00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:45,310
can see that you had s of really in

00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:47,720
balance and then I think conference

00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:50,060
organizers they put into an account they

00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,700
have the diversity mission in their mind

00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:55,880
but still this is difficult to achieve

00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:59,870
because in the submission is already a

00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:02,990
very very imbalance demographic and so

00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:05,660
how can we improve that how can we

00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:08,180
encourage more diverse speaker maybe not

00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:11,930
just gender maybe speaker with different

00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:14,890
backgrounds to speak so I will also talk

00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:14,890
about that later

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:23,000
but before I specifically talk about

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,800
some suggestion that we could do in the

00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,780
Python community I would like to talk

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,290
about the diversity problem in theatres

00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:32,360
because as the person living in London I

00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:34,880
love going to a theatre I'm very lucky

00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:38,390
that you know London is a theatre City

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,520
so um yeah so it's like this is also a

00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:43,670
hot topic in London like theater goer

00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:45,950
critics day they really like notice this

00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:48,770
diversity problem in theatres so maybe

00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:52,940
from learning from them we can we have

00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:55,820
some idea of how we can improve so I

00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:57,590
also read a lot about news and blog

00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:00,470
posts in theatres so this is one of the

00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:03,560
post that I come across is talking about

00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:07,070
saris talk about the best way to address

00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:09,050
the theatres lack of diversity so yeah

00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:12,530
there's a problem so so what's the

00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:15,320
problem specifically um who is on the

00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:17,030
stage it's like it's kind of similar to

00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,520
my problem about you know conference

00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:23,060
speakers so people on a speck on the

00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:26,630
stage it's actually attracting people

00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:28,220
who will be participating but like for

00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:30,980
example in London theatre there's a

00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:34,140
problem because some productions they

00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:36,390
have a whole cause of 22

00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:39,840
white actors on stage so there's for

00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:42,480
them the more diversity questions

00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:45,840
they're addressing is maybe ethnicity of

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,820
the actors so sometimes you know a play

00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:51,600
it could be a modern play could be the

00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:53,690
the race of the actor is not the most

00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:57,480
important thing but still it's very

00:15:53,690 --> 00:16:01,980
white dominating on business and it was

00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:04,970
in audience also in London I love London

00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:08,220
being with such a diverse City is like

00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:10,880
44% of the people in in London they are

00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:14,580
there and you know they're classifiers

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:17,280
pame which is kind of we can say they're

00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:19,950
they're like ethnic minorities they're

00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:23,220
you know um you know Asian you know

00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:25,290
black you know so um yeah but still if

00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:27,330
you if you are like a little London

00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:28,740
theatre goer like me you can see that if

00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:31,680
you go to the Royal Court Theatre in

00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,570
London has seemed most audience because

00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,820
my experience I go to see a play that's

00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:38,100
the Asian plague it's almost all the

00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,690
cars are Asian girls and then but but

00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,280
still because this the Royal Court

00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:44,220
Theatre is located in the very

00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:46,050
prestigious location in London it's like

00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,150
in the in the audience it's like it's

00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:52,230
still very like um have white

00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:54,120
middle-class dominating and also there's

00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:56,520
a problem in in Forenza it's kind of

00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,830
like the leaders of theater like who is

00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,660
making the decision who who are the

00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:03,660
artistic director of theatre who decided

00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:05,370
what production to put on stage and you

00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:08,730
know all the critics they would be like

00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:11,160
you know the identity may kind of change

00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:13,470
the way they how they just whether this

00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,339
plays a good play or not a good play so

00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,970
hmm

00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:21,720
this inference that is also not very

00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:27,990
much of them are from ethnic minority

00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:29,280
group so so in that blog post also

00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:35,610
talked about the chicken and egg

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:37,860
situation because um the writer he

00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:41,550
mentioned at one time there's a play

00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:45,060
quorum call fella happening in London

00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:46,950
and he's paralyzed actually about a

00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,850
Nigerian singer so like he's very

00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:51,090
popular

00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:52,590
Nigeria I guess so when this right at

00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:54,809
that time he was like you know traveling

00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:56,460
in the cap and lots of the cab drivers

00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:58,500
in London they're from Nigeria and they

00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,690
mentioned to him that oh I love this

00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,510
play I went to see that again and again

00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:05,910
again you can imagine a cab driver they

00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:07,650
are not earning a lot of money but they

00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:09,720
they maybe rarely go to the theater but

00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:12,030
then because they're from Nigeria their

00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:14,160
identity kind of give them like

00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:16,169
attraction to this show about a Nigerian

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,120
singer so they love the show that good

00:18:16,169 --> 00:18:21,330
to see it again and again and again so

00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:24,120
um so what's being on stage actually a

00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:27,510
fact who is watching it or who is

00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:30,539
participating but but sometimes the

00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:33,120
problem is like if your audience is

00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:34,919
mainly you know I said before if you're

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,929
audience many wise then maybe you want

00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:38,730
to have white actors on stage because

00:18:36,929 --> 00:18:42,690
you have to attract people to watch it

00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:45,120
but this then then is become a loop and

00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:47,580
healthy loop that it will really stay in

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,500
- only one majority group and ignoring

00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:55,880
the minority groups which is not very

00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:59,070
good so also there's another write

00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:01,710
another article which is a very very

00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:04,020
interesting it's about how to improve

00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:06,240
this situation like how to make it more

00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:11,730
accessible for people from a different

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:13,980
background so for example I mentioned

00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:17,070
about the inference of the people who

00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:20,220
make the decision the case keeper so

00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:21,960
nowadays in London you can you can see

00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:24,360
that there's like in some kind of very

00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,850
famous theatre the artistic director of

00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:29,250
those theatres there's like more and

00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:31,500
more people from the minority groups

00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:35,039
there being the artistic directors I've

00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:38,250
met one lady I think she she she's not

00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:43,020
white but she is the artistic director

00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:45,419
of one of these famous theatre I think

00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:48,059
she really can't remember but yeah she

00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:50,010
she's an artistic director and and I am

00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:52,440
sure that there's a lot of artists that

00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:54,510
they are like talented artists in the

00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:57,510
minority group and it's just like it's

00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:59,850
taking them like quite a long time we've

00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:01,210
if we like kind of discover them they

00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:04,690
may become you know

00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:07,510
driving this you know big will to go to

00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:09,160
different directions so it's a good

00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:12,460
thing that they they kind of changing

00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:15,480
now in London and also in the theater

00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:18,970
itself there's accessibility for example

00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:21,280
in London now there I kind of enjoyed

00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:23,830
that as well because there's always some

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:26,020
have cheaper tickets like ten pounds to

00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:29,050
watch a play in the West End which is

00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:31,000
which is very very good so if you book

00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:32,980
early enough you'll be able to enjoy

00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,020
some cheap ticket so theatre is kind of

00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,340
become accessible for even though for

00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:39,280
people who don't have a lot of budget

00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:41,560
also the theater you know sometimes you

00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,660
know this the bar and restaurant they

00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:46,990
try to not always have expensive stuff

00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:48,400
maybe some kind of still more expensive

00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:50,560
than you know buying from a corner shop

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,900
but but they try to make it not super

00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:55,210
fancy and or not for people who are like

00:20:52,900 --> 00:21:00,880
in a dress and assert to and joy which

00:20:55,210 --> 00:21:04,000
is good um also some accessibility

00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:07,590
measure was implied for example they

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:11,020
have they have some sign language

00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:13,450
performance so is for people you know

00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:15,160
hearing impaired they have a pump they

00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:17,490
can enjoy the performance even though

00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,810
they can't hear I've been to a

00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:22,660
production with one of the drama school

00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:24,610
a famous Drama School in London and they

00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:26,860
have two cars one cost is their student

00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:28,780
very talented student and the other cost

00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:33,370
which is performing with them side by

00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:35,950
side they are they are actors that you

00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:38,290
know they use sign language they they

00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:40,930
may be deaf but they use sign language

00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:42,910
to perform which i think is amazing it's

00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:45,190
amazing production because it's

00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:47,410
accessible for everybody and also

00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:49,150
sometimes there's like audio described

00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:52,030
performance including the one that I

00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:54,010
went to for some stage direction they

00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:56,110
would describe it they say it out

00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:58,450
because for people maybe they have sight

00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:02,380
impaired they could still enjoy the

00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:04,690
performance and also for example SS

00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:08,700
about horror and all this is is for

00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:12,610
people who maybe have mobility problems

00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:14,370
also and is this one thing that a lot of

00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:16,680
places overlook I think

00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:18,210
popular in movies is a relaxed

00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:20,370
performance so the light won't be

00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:22,290
totally them people are welcome to come

00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:24,510
in and out because maybe they are

00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:26,610
parents with kids so like they can bring

00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,980
kids into them the movie or bring the

00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,760
baby to movie if the baby have nice they

00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,830
need to Kate

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,470
care for the baby they can't go in and

00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:36,570
out and everybody go to that screening

00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:39,030
they understand that is for parents with

00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:40,950
the baby which I think I think it's a

00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:44,070
good thing I mean like parents shouldn't

00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:49,410
be um you know pinned down did not enjoy

00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:51,300
this so okay I would spend I'm the rest

00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:53,160
of the talk talking about what we could

00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:56,970
do in Python community can we learn

00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:59,790
something from the theater have BSA

00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:02,220
improve so in the blog post that I

00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:04,830
mentioned in in the beginning I also

00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:06,720
mentioned that Pike or now is having a

00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:09,600
great improvement because you can see

00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,120
that and spy doing like you know

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:15,690
encouraging women to come to come to the

00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:17,370
conference they have you know talks by

00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:19,650
women's starting from a very low

00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:22,500
percentage to ass forty percent which is

00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:24,929
really really good and this is vikon in

00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:27,720
the US so I think in Europe we are doing

00:23:24,929 --> 00:23:29,610
that as well she's which is very very

00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,760
good it's the really care

00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:35,070
carry on the momentum also non focused

00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:39,179
um you can see that they're both outside

00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:42,030
there on their a organization that is

00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:44,760
like helping this you know funding this

00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:47,070
potato community so you can see that

00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:51,809
they have also measures they have this D

00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:54,270
is C committee and there they have all

00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:55,800
these I'm mailing list and discussion I

00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:58,559
join of mailing me so that's why I

00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:01,429
receive informations and also they're

00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:04,110
giving diversity scholarship so for

00:24:01,429 --> 00:24:06,900
people from the minority group if they

00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:08,610
kind of have struggling to get a ticket

00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,940
and they could maybe apply for

00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:13,440
scholarships to attend the conferences

00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:15,990
so Jungle Girl is amazing

00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:19,200
we had the Jungle Girl Day on Monday

00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:22,290
which is it which been like recurring

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,900
thing for Europe - now every year we

00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:28,160
they have this jungle kind of like a

00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,160
beginner's day to encourage

00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:35,700
women especially to start using Python

00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:38,100
and do something about jungle the Bilbo

00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:41,400
clothes using jungle and it's

00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:44,850
translation of languages is booming and

00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:47,940
then also um my friend mentioned is very

00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:49,710
empowering for women because jungle girl

00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,929
prefer of course likes date they also

00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:55,320
have male mentors but they prefer girls

00:24:51,929 --> 00:24:58,590
who have been off women who have been to

00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:01,559
the B participate before come back to

00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:03,750
become the mentor because um well it

00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:06,330
shouldn't be always man teaching women

00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:08,330
it should be you know we you shouldn't

00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:10,410
care about the genders like who

00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:15,780
experienced teach to people who don't

00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:18,179
have experience so so in my opinion and

00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:21,419
for conferences because yeah I am now

00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:25,190
involved in conferences Allah so I have

00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:28,710
a lot of ideas for example child care

00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:30,600
facilities I think Python UK is doing it

00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:33,419
how data is doing it um

00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,850
paddle on those doing it so um yeah I

00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:38,970
think maybe Europe - maybe we should

00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:42,510
consider as well because um yeah because

00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:45,450
I you can it's like those theatres thing

00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:46,890
rights like parents shouldn't be um you

00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:48,750
know they shouldn't have these mind that

00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:50,880
oh oh I have to care about my baby so I

00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:53,610
can't go to the conference also a

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,820
diversity in topics again you know um

00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:58,350
how we can make the cocoa proposed or

00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:01,770
more diverse it's like maybe we

00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:04,740
encourage different topics so um like

00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:07,559
the academic you know diversity you know

00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:09,570
maybe people from journalist background

00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:12,090
or a statistic background they could

00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:15,150
also talk about their work so we are not

00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:17,820
limited to one kind of a profession one

00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:20,610
domain or one topic so people from a

00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:21,179
different background like a difference

00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:23,460
you know

00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:25,620
professions they can also if they work

00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:30,690
related to Python in some way then they

00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:32,760
could also present and also we should

00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:34,530
also put some emphasis on education

00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:37,230
again you know we see from the

00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:40,140
university example maybe we have to

00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:42,500
inspire more young girls to be you know

00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,870
doing more you know what

00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:48,680
the science or an engineering subject so

00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:50,240
yeah um also I think we should go beyond

00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:53,420
the jungle girl workshop don't go go I

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,790
was amazing as I said but um I think it

00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:58,220
shouldn't be limited to one topic like

00:26:55,790 --> 00:27:01,280
jungle one framework jungle we we should

00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:04,940
expand it to are the topics because now

00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:05,810
python is not just used for web you know

00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:08,720
um

00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:10,730
web development it could be using all

00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,890
different type of stuff so maybe um

00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:15,680
because I am a scientist I involve in

00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:17,990
data science um and also Paiva is very

00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:20,180
popular in data science now so maybe we

00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:23,120
should have something similar in data

00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:27,200
science to you know have a workshop to

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:30,980
encourage gender minority especially

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:33,590
women to just start the career said you

00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:38,930
know in Dana science and also we should

00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:42,380
fear free the gender barrier for example

00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:45,350
we have people who are like you know we

00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:48,200
have trans code which in Pilon tinium

00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:50,900
they have the chance code workshop that

00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:53,600
so people identify as trans or you know

00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:55,730
um it's more for for people have certain

00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,440
you know identity they could you know

00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:59,930
feel that they're not alone so they're

00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:03,110
not a minorities in they got support

00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:07,280
from the community as well also this man

00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:09,710
I love it non gender label toilet so my

00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:13,820
lashing hai Kaun UK and they did a lot

00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:17,030
of work in this um non non gender label

00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:20,480
on toilet so is the toilets is labeled

00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:23,270
as whether you have a you Rhino or not

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:26,180
so it doesn't matter what gender is like

00:28:23,270 --> 00:28:29,270
what facility you you're using and also

00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:32,120
the t-shirts issued like my friend just

00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:34,250
told me in the non focused guy in life

00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:37,070
you organize a party conference your

00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:40,400
t-shirt should be not gender labor

00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:42,800
should be is when it's like a straight

00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,720
cut always fitted so it's also it's

00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:48,890
about your body shape is not about your

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:51,170
gender which i think is amazing and this

00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:53,240
is mainly for conference but I also we

00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:56,600
have other problems in the community and

00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:58,340
we have to try this of it for example

00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,340
maybe we mean we need more female

00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:04,640
leadership and contributors some for me

00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:06,860
my my idea is I maybe if I organize some

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,840
sprints meetup maybe I should have some

00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:11,570
you know again it's like Jungle Girl you

00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:13,850
know some meetup that is mainly for

00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:16,220
encouraging people in a minority that

00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:18,050
you are not alone you're not you've got

00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:20,810
support from a community let's do it

00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:22,460
together so again I'm started to get

00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:25,520
them you know work their way to as the

00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:30,440
leadership or become a maintainer in the

00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:32,510
contributions um also yeah in in you

00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,280
know who young people and then in

00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:36,770
academia or even not just young people

00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:39,110
maybe for researchers we have to maybe

00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:41,660
do some outreaching to tell them pathi

00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:47,330
is a good tool let's use Python instead

00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:48,890
of our so yeah I only got one minutes

00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:51,800
left so I don't think I could take a lot

00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:54,590
of questions now here but I have this

00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,220
