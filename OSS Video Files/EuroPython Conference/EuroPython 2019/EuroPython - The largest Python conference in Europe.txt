mr. community I get to meet a lot of

00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:27,840
like-minded people and talk about a good

00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:32,640
solution with very diverse coverage of

00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:56,100
different topics absolutely amazing life

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:57,989
coding on the stage the reason why I'm

00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,120
three times here works because I really

00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:05,880

knowledgeable various kind of

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:17,759

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:21,630
don't know what you will learn it's

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:24,630
about culture paper talk does not on the

00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,369
agenda is the whole way track so it was

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,150
good to spend time not going to talks

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:29,150
