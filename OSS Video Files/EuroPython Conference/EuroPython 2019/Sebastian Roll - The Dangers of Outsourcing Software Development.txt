	"The Dangers of Outsourcing Software Development
[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-11 - Shanghai]
[Basel, CH]

By Sebastian Roll

Customer lock-in. Dubious “Land and Expand” strategies. We have all heard about outsourced software projects that run far past schedule and obliterates the budget, yet somehow fail to meet even basic requirements. 

How can this happen. How can your company reduce the risks of delegating software development to an external party? 

The Principal–Agent Problem is a well researched dilemma in economic literature. It occurs when a person or entity (“agent”), is tasked to work on behalf of another person or entity (""principal""). When the two parties have divergent interests, the agent might act contrary to the best interests of the principal.

Examples of principal-agent relationships are:
- Employer vs Employee
- Shareholder vs Management
- Voter vs Political party
- Contractor vs Software Consultant

When a firm decides to outsource software development to a third party, there is an economic divergence of interest at play, as both parties seek to maximize profit. The contractor wants its requirements met at low cost and on a predictable schedule. The third party, when acting nefariously, can maximize its own gains by extending the project, utilizing junior or low-cost labor, and creating a relationship of dependency.

In this session we will look into some nefarious techniques and practices used in the IT consulting industry and how best to avoid them. We will also learn why it is particularly hard to mitigate the risks of outsourced software development.

thank you all for coming this is a spicy

00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:17,270
title isn't it at least the first one

00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,500
looks very exciting I don't know how we

00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,780
feel about the second one

00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:24,680
but we'll find out if that's interesting

00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:27,880
too so my name is Sebastien Hall I have

00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:32,379
a teeny tiny company that does

00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:34,879
consulting cakes I do hardware design I

00:00:32,379 --> 00:00:38,300
like to play around with micro Python

00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:40,850
and until recently I also was a senior

00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:44,510
consultant at a medium to large-sized

00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:47,839
consulting company in Norway so the

00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:52,249
agenda for today is to explain what the

00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:53,839
principal-agent theory problem is look

00:00:52,249 --> 00:00:58,309
at it in the context of software

00:00:53,839 --> 00:01:00,319
consulting we're gonna have a look at

00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:04,580
some sneaky things that a consulting

00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:06,920
company might do and we're gonna have a

00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:13,520
look at mitigation strategies what we

00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:14,150
can do about it so let's start at the

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,150
beginning

00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:19,790
what is the consultant to I'm sure

00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:23,750
you've seen one of those maybe at the

00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:27,290
office we like to wear shirts at least I

00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:29,450
wear a shirt at the interview and maybe

00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:31,580
sometimes for the first day at work and

00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:35,300
then I relax a little bit and I start

00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:39,800
wearing my t-shirts again so consultants

00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:44,030
are called in to gain some some external

00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:47,420
some objective advice that you can't get

00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:51,380
in house recommendations a consultant

00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:54,130
might also be an expert at a field where

00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:56,960
you're missing that competence in house

00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:59,600
but a consultant can also be a person

00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,900
that helps you out temporarily at a

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,060
project that you have and you need extra

00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:07,790
hands

00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:10,670
it can even be that part of your project

00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:15,790
or even the entire project itself might

00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:15,790
be handled by a consulting company

00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:26,930
so these are the four main parts of

00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:31,970
being a consultant and it's booming it

00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:35,150
grows every year technology and IT

00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:38,930
consulting can comprises 20% of the

00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:40,280
global consulting market recruiting is

00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:43,300
very high especially in Norway for

00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,890
consulting companies and they pay well

00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:48,830
it's exciting to be a consultant because

00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:50,990
you can get to see many different

00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:52,940
technologies you get to see how things

00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:58,220
are in many different companies and you

00:02:52,940 --> 00:03:00,620
learn fast some businesses they like the

00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:02,690
idea of having a consultant because then

00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:04,760
you can just get someone in for a

00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:07,490
specific purpose and when they finish

00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,920
with their job they leave so you don't

00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:13,370
have to deal so much about retaining

00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:16,160
people laying people off when there's no

00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:24,709
need for them so it's easier to get rid

00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:29,720
of us but IT projects do not always fare

00:03:24,709 --> 00:03:32,690
well so there was a study in 2015 from a

00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:36,470
Norwegian University called success and

00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:39,140
failure in public IT projects and it had

00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:40,670
some damages to take statistics so what

00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:44,540
they did that it was that they found

00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:47,420
five metrics that they used one is use

00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:51,500
value of the deliverable technical

00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:55,450
quality of the product cost control in

00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:59,830
the project time management and lastly

00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:03,019
efficiency in the project execution and

00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:06,230
they found out that only 8% of these

00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:11,810
projects succeeded on all these success

00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:14,709
factors around 50% were unsatisfactory

00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:17,570
and at least one of these factors and

00:04:14,709 --> 00:04:20,479
also the largest projects seem to be

00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:22,930
over-represented and in the cases where

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,930
there are failures

00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:32,159
to bring up one example we had was there

00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:34,560
was a project in Oslo or a capital to to

00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:39,240
have a unified electronic ticketing

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,069
system for our public transportation so

00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,139
if there are any Django developers here

00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:49,289
they would maybe say this I think it'll

00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:52,949
take three weeks it took ten years and

00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:55,830
it cost around 67 million euros and it

00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:58,020
was a complete failure what the report

00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:59,759
also interestingly found was that they

00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:03,030
found no significant difference between

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:15,449
private and public IT projects they all

00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:20,550
had very similar failure rates so what

00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:22,409
causes this what makes a bad project why

00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:25,940
do we overspend and why do we under a

00:05:22,409 --> 00:05:28,409
chief why do we delay is it the client

00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:32,069
does the client not give good enough

00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:37,080
specifications is it the contractor do

00:05:32,069 --> 00:05:37,830
they do not deliver high quality usually

00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,740
it's a bit of both

00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:42,240
usually it's one usually it's the other

00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:45,779
usually sometimes it's external factors

00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,270
that you cannot proceed maybe a key

00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:51,770
person or some key personnel drops out

00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:56,969
of the project and you lose important

00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:58,860
experience but for the purpose of this

00:05:56,969 --> 00:06:01,009
presentation we're gonna be focusing on

00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:03,419
the contractor the consulting company

00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:07,770
but to get closer to the nature of this

00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:10,219
problem let's consider a more simple

00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,219
example

00:06:14,289 --> 00:06:19,789
so your car breaks down or your car

00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:21,440
starts making a noise an annoying noise

00:06:19,789 --> 00:06:24,470
and then there's a dashboard light that

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:28,280
comes up one of those dangerous genie in

00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:29,810
a bottle lights and you're worried so

00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,970
what can you do you can do one of two

00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:35,120
things you can either decide I'm gonna

00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:37,669
learn about car repairs I'm gonna spend

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,919
a couple of months studying this and I'm

00:06:37,669 --> 00:06:42,169
gonna try to do it myself for me if I

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,360
tried that it would still be my first

00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:47,300
attempt trying to fix a car so I would

00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:49,270
probably still fail so what I would do

00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,569
is I would take it to a repair shop and

00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:54,979
the repair guy he comes he looks

00:06:52,569 --> 00:06:58,060
Pleasant he has a look at the problem

00:06:54,979 --> 00:07:01,159
gives me a diagnosis it gives me a price

00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:04,159
but there are two important concepts

00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:07,039
that are at play here in this

00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:09,590
interaction and one is that the repair

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:12,770
guy knows much more than I do about the

00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:15,770
domain so the repair guy knows a lot

00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:18,169
about repairing cars but I don't so I

00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:20,419
don't have any good way to figure out if

00:07:18,169 --> 00:07:22,430
he's actually telling the truth or not

00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:29,000
he's he's scamming me is he being

00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:34,190
reasonable is he a good repairman is he

00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:37,009
even a car repairman at all the second

00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:40,159
factor is there's a potential difference

00:07:37,009 --> 00:07:41,870
in interest here so my interest is to

00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:44,569
get the car repaired as fast as possible

00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:45,740
if you can work overtime that's cool if

00:07:44,569 --> 00:07:48,380
you can do it for free that would be

00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:51,139
great if not then the lowest possible

00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:54,259
price whereas the repair car repair

00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:57,409
person he wants to get as high price as

00:07:54,259 --> 00:08:01,009
he can that would still make me happy to

00:07:57,409 --> 00:08:03,130
pay the price so there are slightly

00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:08,210
different incentive schemes here so

00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:10,669
turns out that economists and people in

00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:14,029
political science they define this type

00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:18,289
of interaction as a principal agent

00:08:14,029 --> 00:08:20,960
problem a principal agent problem occurs

00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:22,669
when you as a principal you want

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,169
something done and you don't want to do

00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:26,759
it yourself you want an agent to do it

00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:31,430
maybe the agent is much better at doing

00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:34,320
than you are this is from Wikipedia

00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:37,050
principal hires the agent the agent

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,940
performs work for the principal there is

00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:43,349
asymmetric information there that comes

00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:44,970
in from the top so one is that I can't

00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:48,089
really know if he's a good repair car

00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:49,440
repair man I don't know if what he's

00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:51,389
telling me is the truth but I also don't

00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,170
really I can't really control him I

00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:56,029
can't really know if he's doing what he

00:08:55,170 --> 00:09:02,190
should be doing

00:08:56,029 --> 00:09:03,930
so that's asymmetric information there

00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,910
is also the concept we talked about

00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:11,449
different interests you see the

00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:15,440
self-interest thing that goes there so

00:09:11,449 --> 00:09:19,529
these two concepts combine to form a

00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:21,360
potential risk for the agent doing

00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:24,480
things that are contrary to the

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,339
principles interest so the agent might

00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:31,199
do things that the principal don't want

00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:35,639
him to do not want him to do and the

00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:37,889
result we call adverse selection

00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:41,339
you might pick the wrong person for the

00:09:37,889 --> 00:09:44,329
job and also moral hazard moral hazard

00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:46,680
is that thing where the agent is working

00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:50,310
contrary to your interests as a

00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:52,170
principal and this works on four

00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:54,889
fundamental assumptions one is that

00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:57,930
principal and agent are rational actors

00:09:54,889 --> 00:10:01,050
to the action of the agent affects the

00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:02,880
success outcome of the principal the

00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:06,560
principal cannot fully control the agent

00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:09,839
and there's a divergence of interest a

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:13,519
play and that causes the potential of

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,519
adverse selection and moral hazard

00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:22,240
this concept is relevant to many

00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:23,860
different things it's it can be

00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,050
described an employer-employee

00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:29,529
relationship can be described in this

00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:31,870
way shareholder management they might

00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:34,060
have different incentives shareholder

00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,950
wants to maximize profit management

00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:38,620
maybe wants to keep his job and they

00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:48,720
have a more stable outlook for his for

00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:51,370
the company so asymmetric information

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,750
many of you might already be looking at

00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:56,890
this and thinking is this high quality

00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:58,630
code and you might be able to determine

00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,010
that but if you're not a coder you're

00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:01,839
not going to be able to determine that

00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:05,440
you have no way of knowing if this is

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,960
high quality you can only ask does it

00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,120
work maybe but it does it work is that a

00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:12,430
good enough

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:17,760
qualification for a good execution or

00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:17,760
for a good product definitely it's not

00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,640
they're different interests you might

00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:26,680
want I wanted a house I wanted it to be

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,600
built according to specification I gave

00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,880
them dimensions and everything and this

00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,600
is what they gave me

00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:36,640
they minimize their own cost to to hand

00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,390
in a product that's according to

00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,390
specifications

00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:55,910
now what I'm gonna do in my research

00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:58,189
here I found a publication called

00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:59,959
principal-agent theory and its

00:11:58,189 --> 00:12:03,920
application to analyze outsourcing of

00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:06,319
software development and we're talking

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,709
about like how does this principal agent

00:12:06,319 --> 00:12:12,350
problem apply to software consulting and

00:12:08,709 --> 00:12:13,879
it says I quote the problem is

00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:15,920
especially glaring for the software

00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:17,480
business due to missing metrics and

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,120
measures for programmers project

00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,069
productivity and software quality the

00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,100
missing concreteness of software makes

00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:27,350
it harder to control effort invested and

00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:29,680
results reached so I would say

00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:32,029
definitely that software consulting is

00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,839
has the potential of asymmetric

00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:41,649
information for sure and there's also

00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:44,120
diverging interests so let's play a game

00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:46,430
alright I know there are some hackers in

00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:48,769
the audience maybe some pen testers so

00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:51,230
we're gonna have fun and figure out

00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:54,679
which exploits can we find if we're Anna

00:12:51,230 --> 00:13:01,399
Faris agent how can we maximize our own

00:12:54,679 --> 00:13:03,339
gains according to our interests so what

00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:06,459
we can do we can do the bait and switch

00:13:03,339 --> 00:13:10,639
so you get the top guy in your company

00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:12,769
really good guy has awesome CV he's very

00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,120
good at writing proposals you kind of

00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:17,899
implicate that he's going to be part of

00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:20,870
the project you use the brand that you

00:13:17,899 --> 00:13:22,939
have you're a big company maybe you're

00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:25,100
recognized and then when you get the

00:13:22,939 --> 00:13:28,370
contract you kind of changed the terms

00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:30,649
all of a sudden this guy awesome star

00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:34,069
guy he's out of the project and replaced

00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:37,600
by ten junior developers who are four

00:13:34,069 --> 00:13:39,980
just recent graduates we slap some

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:44,059
certification on these junior graduates

00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:51,079
so they have some at least something on

00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:52,819
their CV and the junior devs they make

00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:54,829
more mistakes too so that means that

00:13:52,819 --> 00:13:55,080
there's more work to be done there's

00:13:54,829 --> 00:13:57,060
more

00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:59,520
bugs to be fixed and that's also good

00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:05,340
for when product is delivered and you

00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:08,100
want maintenance so one thing to say

00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:10,850
about that is that resumes are personal

00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:13,530
or professional its personnel marketing

00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:18,590
devices that people use and the

00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:18,590
potential for for puffery is is there

00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:25,830
the second one is called the land and

00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:28,530
expand so you do kind of a similar thing

00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:32,100
you get your top guy into the company

00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:34,530
only him and you have him do a great job

00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:37,620
at one or more projects and then you

00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:41,610
have him climb up the corporate

00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:43,560
hierarchy gain trust and when you do

00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:46,260
that you you try to get build some

00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:48,510
goodwill and then you are in a position

00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:51,390
to start influencing the decision making

00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:53,700
processes so now every time it comes up

00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:56,040
oh we we might need to build a new

00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:59,610
website because our website is two years

00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:02,760
old and there's a new thing that we need

00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:04,740
to new technology then this guy can say

00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,170
oh we have actually the star team we

00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:09,660
have the perfect team and before you

00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:13,260
know it you will find that consulting

00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:16,140
company is everywhere with also junior

00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:20,250
devs but it's a great way to get in and

00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:25,680
to increase the number of consultants

00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:28,320
with your clients and talent the guy who

00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:32,580
came in he get he might get some reward

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,230
scheme back home and also you have more

00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:38,420
political allies because you have more

00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:38,420
people from your consulting company and

00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:45,720
then there's a vendor lock-in so when

00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:49,050
you're already in a company with the

00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:51,540
clients and your nefarious then you want

00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:57,150
to make it as costly as possible to

00:15:51,540 --> 00:16:00,270
replace you so in our circles we have a

00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:02,460
saying that says to leave your code as

00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:04,710
if the next person is a vengeful

00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,830
psychopath that has also knows your

00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,830
address

00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:11,410
but if your nefarious you don't want to

00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:14,589
do that you want to create exclusivity

00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:19,089
you want there to me not so much

00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:21,880
documentation you want maybe to promote

00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:24,399
more novel tools and technologies

00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:27,190
because that decreases the available

00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,959
pool that can replace you if you're

00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:33,790
really smart then you're gonna want to

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:37,720
sell some in-house software into the

00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:39,820
clients so that means that when you're

00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:42,100
the only one who can help out with that

00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:45,399
software no one else knows anything

00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:48,010
about this in-house tool and also it's

00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:50,410
probably it can be some old legacy

00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:52,060
software that you just sold so there's

00:16:50,410 --> 00:16:54,940
not a lot of maintenance on it so when

00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:57,279
your client has a problem because the

00:16:54,940 --> 00:17:00,490
software doesn't run anymore they're

00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:07,209
gonna have to talk to you and you'll say

00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:10,000
oh we can fix that bug for a price so

00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:12,339
make it as costly as possible to replace

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,370
you and then when you're there then you

00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:17,049
can start to inflate the cost of your

00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:20,140
personnel maybe you want to minimize

00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:23,589
effort so you can double staff have them

00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:26,020
work in a different with a different

00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:28,240
client as well if there any changes that

00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,520
wants that needs to be made on the

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,100
project you make a variation order like

00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:34,750
a change order so everything that needs

00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:37,750
to be done extra you're gonna have to

00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:39,130
get paid for that you can also if

00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:41,380
there's a problem you can always blame

00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:45,390
any issues on the client constantly

00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,390
changing the specifications all the time

00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:49,330
since we're talking about nefarious

00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:52,360
actors here why don't we go one step

00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:54,700
further we absorb the business and

00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,919
domain knowledge of the company we're

00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,760
gonna want to recruit the top talent pay

00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:02,500
them a little bit better

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:06,730
and if we're extra devious we'll sell it

00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:09,070
back to them at a premium and there's

00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:11,230
one funny phenomenon that I heard about

00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:13,960
this I'd like to tell you about it's

00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:16,330
called the CV driven development so

00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,850
that's when our consultant comes in and

00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:21,330
he wants to learn the

00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:24,570
new shiny technology so he proposes that

00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:26,730
as a solution because then he gets to

00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:30,690
learn how to use how to use this new

00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:33,080
technology on your belt and you're left

00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:35,520
with maybe something beta stuff and

00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:38,429
anyway it was developed by someone who

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:43,530
learned it the first time so it's not

00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:46,980
necessarily a good deal for you okay so

00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:51,690
how what can we do to mitigate these

00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:55,320
risks that the agents are doing to us so

00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,940
if you remember what I mentioned the two

00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,400
things the a submit information

00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:01,919
asymmetry and the incentive difference

00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:05,940
so you want to decrease the information

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:07,350
gap you don't want to be a project

00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,929
leader a technical leader that has no

00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:12,230
idea about the technological stack I've

00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:15,480
seen that too many times that there's

00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:18,780
there's technical management in-house

00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:20,850
that kind of have outsourced too much to

00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,750
the consultants and that's not a good

00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:24,330
position to be in

00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:28,830
you want to insist on full access to

00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:29,970
source repositories to any metrics you

00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:33,000
want to own the source or source

00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:35,190
repositories preferably the build system

00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,090
the task management system it's good to

00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:40,289
have access to that stuff it's important

00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:42,809
to note that there's also difference

00:19:40,289 --> 00:19:44,880
between information that you get gather

00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:47,070
and also understanding that information

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,510
so information itself will not get you

00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:51,840
anywhere unless you understand what it

00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:54,870
means you might want to introduce a

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,970
technical review by a third party a

00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:59,220
non-partisan party that can come in and

00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:04,110
at least then there's no skin in the

00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:09,419
game for them to to cater to a bad

00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:11,370
solution so just keep someone on your

00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:13,200
side that knows enough to judge whether

00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:18,870
this is a good way forward or a bad way

00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:21,240
forward that also puts accountability to

00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:23,640
your to a person that's your employer so

00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:27,900
you don't want accountability to be with

00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:30,559
the consulting company you want to be

00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,559
part of the project

00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:37,300
you can also try to align these

00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:39,940
incentives so that you get more of the

00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:41,530
same interests you want to maybe

00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:43,660
increase the number of interactions with

00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:45,760
a with a consulting company so don't

00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:48,340
just give them the whole project at once

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,170
maybe just give them a project like a

00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:51,940
small part of the project see how they

00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:55,300
do that gives them an incentive to

00:20:51,940 --> 00:21:00,760
achieve a good solution for you

00:20:55,300 --> 00:21:03,010
split the project into parts yeah you

00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,960
can also do a performance-based reward

00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:06,490
that's been getting more popular now

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,590
that the consulting company comes in and

00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:11,830
say we can just get a cut of whatever

00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:14,890
success that you have and we don't have

00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:16,420
to get paid if you don't succeed it's

00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:18,160
interesting but it also might end up

00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,470
costing you a lot if you have a lot of

00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:22,980
success and also it might not always be

00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:27,390
easy to find a way to measure

00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:28,630
connectively there's monetary success

00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:34,150
okay

00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:36,160
minimize dependency minimize that song

00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:40,390
costs that potential for song cost you

00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:43,530
want to make it easy to replace avoid

00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:47,440
vendor lock-in at all costs that's a

00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:50,440
very good tip insist on using standard

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,250
tools code guidelines proper

00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,660
documentation well-known technologies

00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:58,270
you might want to consider multiple

00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:00,790
contractors so more than one maybe two

00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:02,590
contractors this is this is especially

00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:04,870
useful if you are dealing with more

00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:08,680
novel technology innovative technology

00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:13,450
or like niche languages because then you

00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:15,850
always have one extra supplier it also

00:22:13,450 --> 00:22:16,900
helps to enforce these code guidelines

00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:18,910
because then they will have to

00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:21,630
communicate with each other and share

00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:21,630
code

00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:30,340
one thing to remember is that as

00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:34,590
consultants it's very easy for us to be

00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:37,210
yes-man can-do people yes we can do it

00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:38,380
one of the reasons for that is that if

00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:40,559
we are too critical

00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:43,390
we might be dropped off the project and

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:45,910
it's much easier for us to just get by

00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:48,070
on fixing things for you and doing what

00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:50,470
you tell us to do but if what you tell

00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:52,210
us if you as a client tells us

00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:54,790
consultants to do something that we

00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:57,730
consultants might not agree with then it

00:22:54,790 --> 00:23:01,690
might be feel hard for us for some of us

00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:04,480
to take that discussion because things

00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:05,980
can very quickly turn political if

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,950
there's a consulting company that's

00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:10,750
nefarious and we come in if I were to

00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:13,390
say well this solution is not very good

00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:15,160
there's still a person in house that got

00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:17,290
this consulting company in in the first

00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:21,490
place and he might want to not want to

00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:25,290
feel attacked in that way be aware of

00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:29,470
patchwork and band-aids for things

00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:39,429
instead of big rewrites that's something

00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:42,940
that might happen and in conclusion we

00:23:39,429 --> 00:23:45,130
went very quickly through a principal

00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:47,650
agent problem and how that might apply

00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:51,850
to software consulting in the software

00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:54,370
consulting industry we've seen what

00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:57,490
asymmetric information is and different

00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:59,679
interests and how it can create a risk

00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:02,679
of what's called moral hazard which is

00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:06,580
the agent working against your own

00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:08,260
interests we discussed some possible

00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:11,820
techniques that are available for a

00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:15,809
nefarious actor and how to mitigate them

00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:18,720
but I would like to leave you with two

00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:21,040
important points three important points

00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,230
remember that a consultant always works

00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:24,910
for two companies they work for you as

00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:27,490
the client and they also work for their

00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:28,750
employer and most of us are very good at

00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:31,900
keeping a

00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:34,659
a balanced attitude towards these two

00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:37,530
loyalties but it's always a thing to

00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:38,850
remember that we work for two companies

00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:41,140
[Music]

00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:42,850
the second one is has to do with

00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:46,990
accountability again so if you imagine

00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:49,990
your project is the Titanic then us

00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:52,470
consultants we are the first class first

00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:54,580
class passengers that means we always

00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:57,610
we're the ones that get the lifeboats

00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:59,830
when the ship starts sinking because we

00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:02,950
can go to a different project at a

00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:04,690
different client and the solution itself

00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:07,330
that's not working will stay with you so

00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:12,570
you might find yourself with a violin in

00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:12,570
your arms and players the ship goes down

00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:24,600
but most importantly we are decent

00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:27,640
people most of us are and this

00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:29,679
principal-agent problem comes from

00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:32,789
economic theory it comes from game

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,919
theory it excludes

00:25:32,789 --> 00:25:38,500
sometimes it assumes that we're all

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:41,980
acting in our best interests economic

00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:45,100
interests but it it is also the case

00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:48,280
that if you motivate people and if you

00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:49,870
don't micromanage them if you keep them

00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:52,059
motivated they will do a good job for

00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:54,039
you most likely so that's always

00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:56,409
important to keep in mind I don't want

00:25:54,039 --> 00:25:59,169
you to finally find that you now are

00:25:56,409 --> 00:26:02,370
very too skeptical and are showing it

00:25:59,169 --> 00:26:05,860
too much so just assume good intentions

00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:08,470
encourage mutual trust and avoid

00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:11,230
micromanagement because your consultants

00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:12,820
might go the extra mile for you he might

00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:15,789
want to do it out of personal reasons

00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:18,510
and he will probably put in that extra

00:26:15,789 --> 00:26:21,070
effort that is required sometimes

00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:23,440
so in conclusion do not get tricked by

00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:25,990
the worst among us and nurture and

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,450
support the best among us thank you very

00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:33,180
much

00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:35,380
[Applause]

00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:41,380
thank you very much Sebastian for this

00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:43,410
talk we have time for questions it's

00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:49,480
about you thank thanks for your talk I

00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:52,510
like your car repair metaphor okay how

00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:55,390
would you project your mitigation

00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:58,990
structure as strategies in the car

00:26:55,390 --> 00:27:09,400
repair scenario which scenario did you

00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:11,350
say mechanic is the actor so what kind

00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:14,170
of mythic how would you project your

00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:17,530
mitigation strategies into that metaphor

00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:20,170
yeah so what I would do then is that I

00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:22,720
would try to decrease the information

00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:24,460
gap so part of that information

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,710
asymmetry is that I don't know if he's a

00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:30,250
good repairman or if he's trustworthy so

00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:32,260
I could go to a review site and I would

00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:34,600
see does he have good reviews that would

00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:38,950
help me to get information about other

00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:42,370
people's experience and I wish that

00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:44,470
there was something similar in terms of

00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:46,210
software consulting I think that would

00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:48,760
be very helpful for everyone involved

00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:51,040
but it's it's very difficult because

00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:53,410
then you would need some objective

00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:56,260
metrics and I don't think it would be

00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:59,620
that easy to set up I think most of the

00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:01,710
time more major corporations as clients

00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:06,030
they would have their internal registry

00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:06,030
where they log their own experiences

00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:17,320
more questions yeah thanks for the talk

00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:19,930
as a role as a consultant you talk about

00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:25,540
this information asymmetry and the agent

00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:28,300
and what were the P again principle

00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:30,940
principle and you also told us that

00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:35,620
there exists some technical leaders in

00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:38,950
companies there are a little bit far

00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:41,710
away from the tech experts they need to

00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:43,900
lead do you encounter this this

00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:44,780
principal and agent problem within

00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,610
companies

00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:50,120
and how do you deal with them when they

00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:54,040
are already existing and you yeah join

00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:58,820
that if I encounter this in existing

00:28:54,040 --> 00:29:01,250
companies or does it actors say yeah I

00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:03,920
would say it does exist I have

00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:08,330
encountered situations where there's a

00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:11,450
very very bad situation and somehow it

00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:14,300
needs to be dealt with so it might be

00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:15,800
that technical the solution that is only

00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:18,440
going to be viable for the minimum

00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:20,660
viable product and it's not going to

00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:23,570
work for any real case scenario the

00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:27,830
problem if if the in-house leadership

00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:29,360
lacks the technical know-how specific to

00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:31,640
that domain is that if another

00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,380
well-meaning consultant comes and says

00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:35,270
look at this this is not going to be

00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:37,280
gonna work well we need to do it this

00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:40,460
way and that way instead is what I

00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:43,420
propose then the the management has a

00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:46,360
tough situation because he can't really

00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:50,150
do any value judgment whether or not

00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:52,310
that well-meaning person is correct so

00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:54,590
that makes it in turns it into almost

00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:57,830
like a trust issue who do I trust the

00:29:54,590 --> 00:30:00,170
most and then sometimes the person who's

00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:04,810
been there for longer has gained more

00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:07,070
trust so I definitely find that to be a

00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:09,380
difficult situation sometimes and

00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:11,230
specifically for companies that don't

00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:17,990
have software as their main revenue

00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:19,820
generating area all right thanks again

00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:22,430
Sebastian for this nice talk and if you

00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,340
have further questions come optin thank

00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:25,400
you
