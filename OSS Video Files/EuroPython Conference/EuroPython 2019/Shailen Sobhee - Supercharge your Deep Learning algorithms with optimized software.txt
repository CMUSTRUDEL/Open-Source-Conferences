In this talk, you will learn various optimization techniques to improve the runtime performance of your deep learning algorithms on Intel architecture. The presentation will cover how to accelerate the training of your deep neural networks with Tensorflow thanks to the highly optimized Intel® Math Kernel Library (Intel® MKL) and how we boost inferencing with Intel® nGraph and with the Intel® Distribution of OpenVINO™.
