By Cristián Maureira-Fredes

One of the main Python aspects is to have a clear syntax and be an
easy-to-understand language, which compared to others like C++
(depending of the kindness of the developer) can make a huge difference.
Not only the readability is in play, having a dynamically typed
and interpreted language improves the development workflow.

This improvement comes with a cost, performance.
In most of the cases, a raw comparison of simple routines will leave
Python behind, but there is a partial solution to this problem, connecting
a powerful performant C++ library with the simplicity of Python.

In this talk, we will go through the process of generating language bindings
to allow you to take any amazing C or C++ project and bring it to Python
land. We will briefly discuss one of the many success stories, and we will
analyze how the Qt project managed to expose its whole framework to Python,
with the help of a self-made binding generator called Shiboken.

After the talk, you will be able to decide which option is better for the
projects you have in mind, and with a bit of luck you will be responsible
of exposing the next popular C++ library that makes the life of us all Pythonistas easier.
