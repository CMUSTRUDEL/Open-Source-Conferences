By Lynn Cherny

Most of us work too much and play too little.  When was the last time you smiled at something you made?  Playing with fun datasets, especially big data sets, opens up weird new forms of technical recreation.  Why not train an amusing model in a browser tab while you're waiting for that day-job Spark query to finish?  I'll show you some data toys I've built using AI and interesting data sets: Most of them involve both backend data science and front-end visualization tricks.  They range from poetry-composition helpers to game log analysis to image deconstruction and reconstruction. All of them taught me something, often about myself and what I like artistically, and sometimes about what ""big data"" actually means.

Thanks yeah I don't have two PhDs I also

00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:13,610
wasn't registered for the conference and

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,990
my MacBook wasn't working with the

00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:18,710
projector let's see if we get through

00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:22,640
this so very happy to be here

00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:26,270
this is always interesting to me to give

00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,609
talks so I do a lot of NLP these days

00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:30,890
I'm not going to talk about NLP as much

00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:35,420
today although we're gonna do some word

00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:37,129
Tyvek models right now I'm working on

00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,780
hate speech detection toxic and

00:00:37,129 --> 00:00:42,109
offensive speech and it's horribly

00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:44,359
depressing that's also why I'm not gonna

00:00:42,109 --> 00:00:47,350
talk about it okay

00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:50,299
so this talk for me is a is a sort of a

00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:52,460
self-care piece on getting some fun back

00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:54,620
into my daily hacking life so that I'm

00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,879
not working on things like that all the

00:00:54,620 --> 00:01:00,409
time and thinking about things like that

00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:02,119
all the time so I I was a teacher I'm

00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:03,949
actually consulting now that's where I'm

00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:05,960
doing the the hate speech detection but

00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:09,890
I'm still in lino so I'm just down the

00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:12,380
road from you guys bye bye a train when

00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:14,780
I do invite it talks like this I get to

00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:17,120
do what I want right so like I said this

00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,580
is this is me doing self-care and

00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,110
hacking on the weekends and probably I

00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,360
should develop some real life hobbies

00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:27,440
rather than hacking but I'm a nerd just

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:30,050
like you guys so but this is the thing

00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:32,540
about hacking it's really hard for those

00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:34,610
of us who program to separate out the

00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:37,220
programming for fun from the programming

00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,560
for work everybody I talked to is like

00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:41,480
oh yeah I did this side project and I

00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,120
learned how to do bla and now I can use

00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,500
it on my job it's an especially American

00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:48,520
problem where we're always thinking

00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:51,350
about how to monetize our free time

00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:53,390
let's let's do less of that let's make

00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,860
more junk and let's have a good time

00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:57,500
doing it that's one of the things I

00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:01,400
wanted to say to you guys it's also a

00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,409
message to me so I'm gonna talk about

00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:07,159
some things I did for this talk that are

00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:09,539
just totally junk but fun junk that that

00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:10,799
I admit I learned a lot from and

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:12,780
probably wouldn't have done them if I

00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:16,470
hadn't but I was inspired to do them by

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:18,090
by wanting to do junk so you guys might

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,620
be familiar with hieronymus Bosch's the

00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,870
Garden of Earthly Delights this is this

00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:26,640
massive massive beautiful painting with

00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:29,549
these three panes of it the left side is

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,370
sort of a Garden of Eden simple thing in

00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:34,409
the middle we have whatever the hell's

00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,159
going on that has to do with like step

00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:41,459
people on earth and maybe corruption and

00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:43,290
desire and talking fish who knows and

00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:45,480
then over on the right we have the Last

00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:48,450
Judgement are sort of the end of the

00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,569
world hell whatever there's a lot of

00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:54,690
analysis of this picture it's it's a

00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:56,250
form of big data I got really interested

00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,370
in this because of the Bosch bots on

00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:03,420
Twitter the Bosch bot is this person who

00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:06,629
is posting quantum random selections of

00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:09,810
this big picture as a tiny little like

00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:11,430
thumbnail and it's an amazingly fun

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,290
distraction during the day when you're

00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:15,720
watching the American politics and

00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:18,209
British politics scrolling past and you

00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:23,129
get this little picture of pure joy from

00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:26,250
the 1500s what the way it works is he

00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:28,799
posts this or she posts this this image

00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:31,139
that's a very very zoomed in random

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,109
segment and then of course you want to

00:03:31,139 --> 00:03:37,260
go and click on it and you do and you

00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:39,410
get like the bigger context which is

00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,669
random I mean so sometimes it's a good

00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:45,810
segment and sometimes it's not and then

00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:47,849
you fav it and you move on so what I

00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,500
wondered as a data analyst is what are

00:03:47,849 --> 00:03:51,750
the details in this big picture that

00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:58,319
people fave the most what they liked the

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:59,819
most and so I made an app and I these

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,310
are the sort of stages I went through

00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:04,109
doing this I'm gonna because we're a

00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:06,239
hacking audience I want you to know like

00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:08,280
the parts that were fun and the parts

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,750
that were really hard but also because

00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,569
I'm learning while I'm hacking I'm

00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:13,949
pushing through the pain right there was

00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:15,720
some real pain on some of these projects

00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:17,849
so first of all there's this cool

00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,590
library twinned that you you can

00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:21,950
actually you don't need to use Twitter's

00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:25,850
API and it has a really nice come

00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:27,650
interface to pull down tweets and you

00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:29,450
can even say like tweets from this user

00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:31,520
with only images in them which is what I

00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:33,380
did for this case so I pulled down

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,350
January 1st through May 5th of this year

00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:39,830
I finished the project finished for the

00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:41,660
current state in in May so that was a

00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:44,270
super awesome library that I hadn't used

00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:48,110
it's really cool then I used pandas to

00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:50,900
to load that data from JSON sort filter

00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:53,750
do some work on it and get the top ten

00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:56,020
by likes pandas is always fun totally

00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:58,900
awesome

00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:02,090
the part that was interesting and hard

00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,740
and that I did not succeed at talk about

00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:07,010
that in a second is figuring out where

00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:10,130
in the giant giant picture that little

00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:13,250
segment came from you can talk about

00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:15,290
that in a second and then I used leaflet

00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,700
J asked for as a web app to display this

00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:19,430
so you're gonna see a lot of web stuff

00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:23,210
cuz cuz I was sort of getting back to

00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:25,910
some web programming for these so this

00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:29,840
is the app let me just quickly demo it

00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:34,820
so you can see so so what I did was with

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:37,790
the top ten I located them in the image

00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:40,700
and put a little marker there for where

00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:42,500
they were taken from the big picture you

00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:45,380
can see at a glance the thing I was most

00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,360
curious about is are like what panel are

00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:49,820
they coming from the one on the right

00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,290
has an awful lot of action going on it's

00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,640
not too surprising when you look at the

00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,920
actual details of what's going on in

00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,860
that panel there's very little action

00:05:54,920 --> 00:06:00,710
over in the Garden of Eden section and

00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:02,900
then we have a bit and I think there

00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:05,270
would be a bit more when I redo this and

00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,970
update it in the middle panel because

00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:09,890
there's so much stuff there so I wanted

00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:12,080
to size by likes so you can see there's

00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:15,920
a big one here this is the biggest one

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:17,450
and then I was like okay well is it just

00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:20,150
a fact that the things that are older

00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:22,130
have more likes cuz duh but no it's not

00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:26,270
true so this one at the time I did the

00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:30,020
scraping was the most liked but actually

00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:32,460
the newest as well if we click on that

00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:41,760
we zoom in and that's the picture

00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:46,860
people like uh-huh so I learned an awful

00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:48,510
lot about like Twitter from that now if

00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,970
we look at like some other things like

00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:53,160
going on up here so this one this is

00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:56,750
like just burning in hell like that

00:06:53,160 --> 00:07:02,310
little image which is pretty cool too

00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:03,270
there's one down here that I like so so

00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:06,060
one of the cool things about this

00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:07,860
picture is really zooming in is pays off

00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:11,820
a lot this is like big data that's

00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:16,140
totally fun so we can sort of move

00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:19,050
around there's so much detail in this

00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:20,670
picture it's it's ridiculous so this is

00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:24,740
the lowest-level zoom level you can see

00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:28,050
probably like the paint Fleck drying

00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:30,600
effect here this is one of the reasons

00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:33,030
localizing where the little segments

00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:40,470
came from in the big picture was was a

00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:42,420
no-go for me okay okay so so this is

00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:44,460
this is big data big data is just data

00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:47,640
that's hard to deal with right

00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:50,190
it was slow to load the high-res image

00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:51,570
which is 223 Meg in one go in the

00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:54,420
browser which is what I was gonna do

00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:56,490
originally and then if you want to move

00:07:54,420 --> 00:08:00,360
around pan and zoom it's it's basically

00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:01,680
ridiculous tools won't load it you

00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,570
actually get an error warning about

00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,920
decompression bombs which I was like

00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:09,600
what so so basically like you can you

00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,850
can disable that and get it to work with

00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:15,330
it anyway but that that shows you the

00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:17,610
size of this as a big image but worse

00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:20,340
the algorithms I tried to locate where

00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:23,190
that little snippet the the posted

00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:25,560
snippet were in the big image crashed my

00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:27,150
laptop several times now I I could have

00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,730
gone to a remote machine with more

00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:33,150
memory etc but but the way they were

00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:35,400
failing and the kinds of matches I was

00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:37,620
getting when I changed resolutions etc

00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:40,170
were leading me to believe that they

00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,360
weren't going to work if anyone is a

00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:44,759
really good expert at neural

00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,649
template matching and feature detection

00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:47,850
I would love to talk to you afterwards

00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:52,319
to see if I could figure this out

00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:54,839
however there was a there wasn't out

00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:57,540
this was a hack right I'm like okay

00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,549
solving this problem isn't the point of

00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,679
my exercise it was what are the parts of

00:08:59,549 --> 00:09:02,790
the picture people like so I just went

00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:04,679
into Photoshop and figured out where

00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:06,899
these segments were and like hand coded

00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:09,929
a JSON file for the top ten obviously

00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:13,319
that doesn't scale to a live app and I

00:09:09,929 --> 00:09:15,360
talked to the Bosh bot author and he or

00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:18,480
she has added the actual snapshot

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,059
locations with top left corner etc to

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:24,749
all of the posts now just for me so I

00:09:21,059 --> 00:09:27,299
have to make with these after after I'm

00:09:24,749 --> 00:09:29,579
done with this talk so there will be a

00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:31,199
live app showing like what the most

00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:33,509
recent likes and faves were and what

00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:37,920
section of the image they were so so

00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:40,679
that's kind of cool I made a friend so I

00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,470
said I used leaflets so the big data

00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:44,549
part of this for web design this this

00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,809
was something I had been wandering

00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:47,459
around for a while I sort of knew about

00:09:45,809 --> 00:09:49,199
it but I hadn't made anything with it

00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:51,720
you can think of a really big picture

00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:55,259
that you want to zoom and pan on as a

00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:57,929
map and the tools for doing maps on

00:09:55,259 --> 00:10:00,629
online are the tools for doing big image

00:09:57,929 --> 00:10:04,139
display like that so what you do is you

00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:05,730
tile your image you you have sections of

00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:08,549
the big image at different resolutions

00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:10,230
and different size for all these

00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:13,259
different zoom layers and it

00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:14,970
theoretically happens seamlessly I think

00:10:13,259 --> 00:10:16,439
my MATLAB house running out of memory

00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:18,329
and that's why it wasn't so seamless

00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:21,329
when I was moving around but but

00:10:18,329 --> 00:10:24,899
essentially use something that's a map

00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:28,110
tool G Delta tiles to to make these

00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:30,360
layered directory folders for different

00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:31,860
zoom levels and there's a lot online

00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,629
about how to do it it's just interesting

00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:37,619
that we're essentially dealing as tools

00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:39,059
for maps so this is me this morning in

00:10:37,619 --> 00:10:41,669
my hotel room trying to remember the

00:10:39,059 --> 00:10:44,369
bash script to show the size of each

00:10:41,669 --> 00:10:46,980
directory so at the zeroeth level which

00:10:44,369 --> 00:10:50,879
is the top view there's only one image

00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:52,439
and then as you zoom in seven being the

00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:54,449
lowest zoom level where you can see the

00:10:52,439 --> 00:10:55,210
little paint flecks we have the most

00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:57,760
images

00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:59,200
and we only pull up the ones that we're

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,770
looking at at that point which is how

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,750
you get a smooth effect so the other

00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:06,460
thing that's cool about treating this

00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,980
image like a map is that if you use a

00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:11,410
tool like leaflet j/s which is for map

00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:13,600
interactive map display online it's an

00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:15,280
old established tool with lots and lots

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,530
of UI features and controls it's

00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,300
actually really easy to add stuff like

00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:21,280
when i zoom in to a certain level

00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,290
replace it with the rectangle showing

00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,270
where that what the edges of that

00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:27,970
snippet were when I was in back out

00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:31,030
replace it with a dot and you got tool

00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:35,590
tips and things like that so so that was

00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:39,130
cool and they could guys but on a fish

00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:41,710
so so this one it's only because I was

00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:43,630
talking to the Bosch bot about how he he

00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:46,030
or she did the segments of the image

00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:48,550
randomly that I learned why this was

00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:50,590
number one at first I was like well

00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:54,190
obviously that's just people like that

00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:57,400
picture right actually it's it's the

00:11:54,190 --> 00:12:00,220
pinned image on their account at the top

00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,630
of the account and so obviously it's the

00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,940
first thing you see so you go and you

00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:07,660
hit like right it's not just that there

00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:09,910
was a celebrity who went and retweeted

00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:11,800
it and so that's actually why it's

00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,450
number one so that when you're looking

00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,830
at faves on Twitter you're always gonna

00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:18,130
have these effects where somebody really

00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:20,830
famous like accelerates your your liking

00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:26,020
so so it's a bit hard she's a comic

00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:29,350
she's actually pretty funny follow so

00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:31,030
just this past week the pudding who they

00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:33,780
do a lot of interactive interesting data

00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:36,550
visualizations they did something

00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:38,680
similar this is a t-sne layout with

00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:41,770
using mario Klingons roster fairy to

00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,600
square fi the layout they used a tool

00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:46,570
called open sea dragon instead of

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,120
leaflet so you get the same kinds of

00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:51,430
zoom pan move around I don't have a

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,960
mouse so it's like less than cool but

00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:58,840
essentially these are very detailed

00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:01,810
tiled images I could probably plug in my

00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:05,710
same tiles all they've got is the the

00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:07,120
zoom in and out button because they

00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,650
didn't use leaflet they don't get the

00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,540
access to the same number

00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:12,940
UI controls and things that I wanted to

00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:14,980
have so so even if I switched I'd have

00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,780
to do a lot of coding from hand to get

00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:23,290
some of the effects that I was building

00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:25,420
in the app okay so so that was a fun

00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:28,180
project that now has me promising to

00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:33,550
build a live updating real web app

00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:35,620
excellent words effect toys so one of

00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:37,570
these is a project I did last year for a

00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,640
conference that I then didn't go to

00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:42,910
because they had weird funding problems

00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:45,460
but it led to the project after it so

00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:47,050
I'm gonna talk about this so most of you

00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,730
are probably at least glancingly

00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:51,210
familiar with word to Veck which has

00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:53,860
been all over the place for a few years

00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:57,100
the concept in words of X is that we do

00:13:53,860 --> 00:14:00,310
an analysis of text and a lot of text

00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:03,700
and we come up with a essentially a

00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:06,580
matrix with a vector representation for

00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:09,610
each word in the document collection

00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:13,000
that we've analyzed we do that by

00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:16,900
looking at sort of a window of context

00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:19,870
around the words so what we do is we we

00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:22,000
essentially encode in this matrix things

00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:26,470
about the relationship of this word to

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:29,080
other words in the collection which

00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:31,150
means that we can do math on that matrix

00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:33,790
like find me the most similar vectors

00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:36,130
using cosine similarity for instance and

00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:40,810
those are words that are related in that

00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:43,120
they've occurred in the same contexts my

00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:44,950
source for these projects is Project

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,620
Gutenberg which is a great source for

00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:49,300
fair use texts lots and lots of text in

00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,910
lots of formats you can even download

00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:56,080
and read it on your Kindle you can get

00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:58,330
the plain text there are libraries out

00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:01,650
there to deal with getting text out of

00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:04,300
this because it's a huge collection the

00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:07,300
one that I settled on using is actually

00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:10,540
an our Project Gutenberg er from David

00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:12,880
Robinson because it allowed me to query

00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:15,340
by subject so I do a lot of things but

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:19,840
by subject like say ghost stories or

00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:22,090
poetry in this case or detective stories

00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,540
or whatever you can do you can do other

00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:26,670
query

00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:29,560
by author by other types of metadata now

00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:32,590
Gutenberg updates its catalogue fairly

00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:34,780
regularly so you have to keep your local

00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:37,150
copy of the metadata up-to-date because

00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:38,890
their API I don't believe I don't

00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:40,710
believe they have an online API that you

00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:45,130
can query and do all of what we've done

00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:47,290
here all right so anyway so I downloaded

00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:49,930
his code I had to update all of the

00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:51,310
metadata tables because in January in

00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:54,010
particular in January there was a big

00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:55,390
change and then one of the things his

00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:57,670
library does that some libraries don't

00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:59,650
do is it strips out the header texts in

00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:03,790
the footer text which is this sort of

00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:06,900
generic stuff on Gutenberg files you

00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:09,130
don't want that in your language model

00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:11,500
alright so then if you want to make a

00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:12,730
word to beck model there's lots of info

00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:16,690
online about how to do it the most

00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:20,770
popular way is Jensen Jensen wants you

00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:23,100
to put in tokenized sentences so you

00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:26,650
have essentially this is a sentence and

00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:29,500
it's tokens so just the words as a list

00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:31,860
and then your entire document collection

00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:36,400
is one of these for each document

00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:38,350
sentences generally and then I'm giving

00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,510
you this particular code example because

00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:42,970
it shows how to save the model and then

00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:44,710
load the model if you're gonna do the

00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:46,750
kinds of things that I did where you use

00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:48,640
your model for other things you need to

00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:54,310
be able to save and then reload it in

00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:56,530
some place like a flask API so one of

00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:58,390
the attributes of words of X that a lot

00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:00,700
of people have heard about is that you

00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:02,890
can make these sort of 2d layouts that

00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,990
show you those relationships between

00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:07,720
words so like I said you can do cosine

00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:09,670
similarity and determine words that are

00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,220
similar to each other in the vector

00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:14,920
space so you can also make these sort of

00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:17,980
explorable maps thanks to Peter

00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,720
Baumgartner for a gist that I modified

00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:25,500
to get this working quickly for this

00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:31,210
talk so this is folk and fairy tales and

00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:33,820
this is an interactive exploratory tool

00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:35,620
for looking at the space so it's in

00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:37,840
plotly which means that I can

00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:40,840
filter and sorts and things better with

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:44,230
a map so if I if I roll over these you

00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,909
can see see what the words are and see

00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,799
possibly why they are grouped together

00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:51,250
so this is things that have to do with

00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:56,130
time and distance probably fifth six

00:17:51,250 --> 00:18:03,850
fourth eighth afterwords week before

00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:05,470
short afterward years months miles so

00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:09,429
frequently you get parts of speech that

00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:15,760
are that are grouped similarly boy would

00:18:09,429 --> 00:18:18,789
be way better if I had a mouse okay over

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:22,720
here we have things that are say Asst

00:18:18,789 --> 00:18:24,100
mayest West whilst thyself so apparently

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,919
there was some really old-fashioned

00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:29,940
texts in this gutenberg file and it

00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:33,640
grouped all of those old-fashioned

00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:37,090
helper verbs together over here further

00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:40,510
rather sooner higher sweeter etc up here

00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:44,169
we have other languages words from other

00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:46,090
languages which is strange and i could

00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:48,159
go and look at these in this particular

00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:50,669
layout color means that this word

00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:53,740
occurred more often in the text file so

00:18:50,669 --> 00:18:56,159
his gist that i use to make this i

00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:58,990
update it so that you can do your own

00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:02,740
with the word counts as well as the

00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:08,350
model and it makes this cool lets go mad

00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:10,029
okay so so like i said you can find

00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:13,539
words that are related to each other

00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:15,100
with these models so you can do the so

00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:16,659
for polite what are the most similar

00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,429
words courteous friendly cordial

00:19:16,659 --> 00:19:21,730
professional attentive grace gracious

00:19:18,429 --> 00:19:23,020
that looks like a good model so my

00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:24,520
question was what if we went from the

00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:26,740
closest word to polite which is

00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,809
courteous and then from courteous we

00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:31,750
looked for what the closest word is it's

00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:33,820
not necessarily friendly because of the

00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:36,250
way these things work right and so what

00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:37,659
if we kept chaining from word to the

00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:41,740
closest neighbor word to closest

00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:44,010
neighbor in these models and so i made

00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,010
an app

00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:55,000
this is the word fire in a Gutenberg

00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:58,389
older poetry word Tyvek model closest

00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,610
word is burning closest word to that but

00:19:58,389 --> 00:20:05,639
it's a bit distant compared to others is

00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:10,570
folded lids curls silks garlic glossy

00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:12,279
and so if we keep doing that this this

00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:15,159
swoop is supposed to indicate that we're

00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:19,500
reading left to right we get these words

00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:19,500
now if I change to a different model

00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:27,460
this is a slightly different model that

00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:30,399
includes things are released in January

00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:32,860
we get different results so the closest

00:20:30,399 --> 00:20:35,289
word for fire is flame burning crimson

00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:37,330
purple foam gleaming okay

00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:39,580
now if I switch to folklore in fairy

00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:42,490
tales the one I was just looking at it

00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:45,610
in a big big graph we get hearth and

00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:48,070
then pretty far away oven pail emptied

00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:50,260
dipped so think about like Hansel and

00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:51,850
Gretel things like that the witch is

00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:55,630
gonna put them in the oven or whatever

00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:58,600
so these are nouns related to scary fire

00:20:55,630 --> 00:21:00,399
situations probably okay and I don't

00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:03,340
think nerd Tyvek works very well I'm

00:21:00,399 --> 00:21:08,320
gonna talk about that in a second this

00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:11,830
is quite different yeah so nerds of X

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:16,019
which is belts on like Star Trek Doctor

00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:23,289
Who Star Wars firing shooting throwing

00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:26,049
not so surprising all right so so this

00:21:23,289 --> 00:21:27,460
this is another example Alison Parrish

00:21:26,049 --> 00:21:28,960
is the one who inspired me to do this

00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:32,110
originally because she had a poetry

00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,510
Guttenberg corpus and then I made the

00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:36,909
the word Tyvek and then built these apps

00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:38,559
with it so what we're seeing here is the

00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:40,539
vertical distance so the distance

00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:43,720
between one word and its next closest

00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:45,639
neighbor and then the size here is two

00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,159
is essentially encoding the fact that

00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:50,649
there were loops we don't want cycles in

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,269
this list of words it gets boring really

00:21:50,649 --> 00:21:54,100
fast cuz you see the same word repeated

00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:55,570
over and over so I just sort of

00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:58,000
increment the count for a word and then

00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:58,450
go on to the next closest so that we get

00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,030
an act

00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:03,700
chain and the color is just pretty in

00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:08,740
this case I didn't say that as a date of

00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:10,270
his person but it is alright so like I

00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:13,240
said there was new public domain stuff

00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:15,850
in January 2019 so some of the things

00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:17,470
that were at it were really cool things

00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:19,480
to work with like Robert Frost

00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:21,970
Robert Frost is a well-known American

00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,340
poet his stuff all entered public domain

00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:26,020
a bunch of other great fiction works

00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:30,220
that are essentially more modern and

00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:32,320
feel so this is an interesting contrast

00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:35,470
here believe the word believe in the

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:38,290
older model pre January we had a model

00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:41,620
for poetry that went learn grieve suffer

00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:43,690
choose understand etc and then after I

00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:46,300
updated the model with the things from

00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:49,330
January of this year the word just

00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:50,980
released we kept magazines in there

00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:53,410
somewhere which is super weird

00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:55,900
so now believe goes to suppose believe I

00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:58,420
didn't take out loops from the exceed

00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:00,760
word down and then over there in the

00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:04,930
second column magazines satires

00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:07,180
newspaper etc you can see it kind of

00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:08,980
goes off the rails sometimes over to the

00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:11,770
right where we get into really specific

00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:15,270
words like Parliament this isn't a

00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:15,270
poetry model to which is weird

00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:21,490
yeah so this is the source on nerd Tyvek

00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:27,130
so nerd Tyvek is definitely very

00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:29,230
different in its properties now this

00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:31,000
brings me to my next project so so all

00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:32,530
of that was just sort of precursor to

00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:35,410
the project I actually wanted to make

00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:37,330
for this talk which is that I'm really

00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:40,600
interested in creativity assist tools

00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:42,430
that help you build things using AI or

00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,260
machine learning or whatever but but

00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:48,220
with a human solidly in the loop in and

00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:53,050
control so one of my inspirations with

00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:53,740
with text games is things like blackout

00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:56,110
poetry

00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,650
you have an entire text but you only use

00:23:56,110 --> 00:24:04,090
certain words in it

00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:06,340
that's Austin Kleon this is cutout

00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:08,920
poetry or cut-up poetry where it's

00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:11,680
different texts combined in order to

00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:13,240
make a poem by a human author so

00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:17,320
goes all the way back to the Surrealists

00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:20,380
and before this is an interesting case

00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:23,790
this is Resnick off wrote poetry based

00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:25,900
on legal briefings so he took legal

00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:28,320
documents and then put put together

00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:37,150
segments to make poems that are fairly

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:40,930
moving actually so I built an app so

00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:43,810
what I wanted to do was mess up poetry I

00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:46,660
wanted to take like good poetry and then

00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:48,910
play with it at the word level the the

00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:51,430
the inspiration here was like am I gonna

00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:54,310
learn am I gonna make anything better

00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:56,890
probably not but am I gonna learn why

00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:59,680
they did what they did in great detail

00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:02,200
probably so it's a really interesting

00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:04,960
close reading exercise to take someone's

00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:06,280
work and then mess with it but I wanted

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,840
to do it in a kind of principled way

00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:09,970
with lots of constraints so what I

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,850
wanted to do was for each word there

00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:14,950
that I've that's that's in color I'm

00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:17,560
loading up the list of the ten closest

00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:21,130
words in a poetry model what other poets

00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:24,820
might have used instead okay so

00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:28,270
essentially this is an editable demo so

00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:29,680
that's Robert Frost this I have a bunch

00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:31,630
of different models in here where Tyvek

00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:37,390
models I have the older original poetry

00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:39,660
one I have up to 1923 poetry so if I

00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:42,310
pick woods I can pick a different word

00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:45,550
so I'm going through the woods maybe I'm

00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:48,130
going through the fields instead whose

00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:53,020
fields these are I think I know his

00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:56,620
house is in the village his table is in

00:25:53,020 --> 00:26:02,200
the village see this is not not a good

00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:06,540
poem but his tables in the castle I kind

00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:08,680
of like alright so it turns out that

00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:10,150
just I don't get to the color in a

00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:13,330
second it turns out that these longer

00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:19,240
poems are a bit harder to work with let

00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:21,700
me pick something shorter okay so you're

00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:23,320
this is Amy Lowell your voice is like

00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:24,240
bells over roofs at dawn when a bird

00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:32,460
flies

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:33,780
okay you see how they aren't all the

00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,100
same participation so there are words of

00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,870
Eccles that are encoded for part of

00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,490
speech so I could have done that but

00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:40,770
instead I'm building a model that's just

00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:44,070
like what what did other poets do in

00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:53,190
this kind of context right your cry is

00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:54,570
like bells so at the point where you've

00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:55,980
done the second word you might want to

00:26:54,570 --> 00:27:05,580
go back and fix the other one this is

00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:07,980
the way this thing works right okay

00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:15,930
so these these words about time are

00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:16,820
usually the easiest okay now nerd Tyvek

00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:19,680
is weird

00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:26,040
so remember Star Wars Star Trek Doctor

00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:34,520
Who character name role performance

00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:34,520
vocal some of them are just like what

00:27:38,810 --> 00:27:45,980
all right sorry

00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:45,980
I don't know as the pillars I don't know

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,110
so vampires I've got to be at night

00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,160
notice there's like sirens so in one of

00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:57,090
these you get Sith

00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:59,550
the Sith Lord so alright so they're fun

00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:03,930
in fact it turns out that actually the

00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:06,000
really funnest ones are the haiku for

00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:08,250
some reason so so with haiku of course

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,480
you have a syllable count so you have to

00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:12,150
decide am I going to stick with the

00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:15,620
syllable count or not so I usually try

00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:18,420
to stick with syllable count so old pond

00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:21,660
okay now look here's here's a point

00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:24,270
about these these older embeddings they

00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:28,590
are not good at getting contexts of

00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:30,450
words that are very different so if a

00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:31,350
word can appear in different meanings in

00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:33,690
different places

00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:34,950
the modern transformer language models

00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:36,559
are much much better at handling that

00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:39,830
these old models aren't this

00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:42,669
an exact example of that so pond I'm in

00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:45,950
the nerd Tyvek model Doctor Who Amy Pond

00:28:42,669 --> 00:28:49,029
is a character if you're Doctor Who fan

00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:52,399
so is Rory a bunch of these are people

00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:55,639
so essentially the word pond in the nerd

00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:58,100
Tyvek model is is about a person more

00:28:55,639 --> 00:28:59,749
than it is about ponds in the woods or

00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,580
whatever in poetry it's about ponds in

00:28:59,749 --> 00:29:03,889
the woods but so here we essentially

00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:06,259
have a case where where the word Tyvek

00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:08,029
sort of breaks down or this is a shitty

00:29:06,259 --> 00:29:13,759
model for poetry which it definitely is

00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:16,129
okay all right so so let's talk about

00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:18,679
this a little more so in fact the color

00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:20,539
here represents a normalized distance

00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:23,389
between the original word and its next

00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:25,309
closest relative so so essentially if

00:29:23,389 --> 00:29:28,070
you see something that's Pinker that

00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:31,700
means that the next relative here is

00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:34,159
further away from it then the next

00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:35,570
relative is in these cases so that can

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:39,440
mean that that's like an interestingly

00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:43,909
different word that isn't as common in

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:45,710
in these poems I did a lot of work to

00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:47,869
get this color because I'm a database

00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:50,889
person I don't know if it was worth it

00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:53,149
and paid off in terms of actual use

00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:55,940
that's one of the points about doing

00:29:53,149 --> 00:29:57,619
database and interactive work is you

00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:59,929
aren't always sure you're gonna get a

00:29:57,619 --> 00:30:04,549
payoff from the feature that you just

00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:05,840
spent a lot of time working on so so

00:30:04,549 --> 00:30:10,309
essentially this is just me explaining

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:13,429
how how this worked d3 is what I used

00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:15,200
for data visualization on the web the

00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:17,269
way this works just so you understand is

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,490
that you essentially take a domain of

00:30:17,269 --> 00:30:22,249
numbers which in my case are the

00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:24,019
distances between a word and its next

00:30:22,249 --> 00:30:26,570
closest neighbor an array of all of

00:30:24,019 --> 00:30:29,059
those distances and I get the minimum

00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:32,450
and I get the maximum and those are my

00:30:29,059 --> 00:30:35,690
anchor points for the color scale so the

00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:38,090
minimum is gonna be the blue and the

00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:40,190
maximum is going to be the pink so I

00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:42,499
could have recoded this but I just used

00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:44,590
somebody's picture last night at 11

00:30:42,499 --> 00:30:44,590
o'clock

00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:51,340
so that's how that's how the encoding to

00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:53,350
color works so it also turned out that

00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:55,450
to get those scores to get that color

00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:57,730
I had to radically really text the app

00:30:55,450 --> 00:31:00,940
this is a another thing about data vis

00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:03,550
so this is the stack so because I

00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:05,500
stupidly used react the stack is

00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:07,510
incredibly deep here we have the app at

00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:09,430
the top with the dropdowns for the model

00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:11,350
and the poem and then we have the poem

00:31:09,430 --> 00:31:13,510
render we have each line in the poem we

00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:15,760
have words that are clickable that load

00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:17,140
up a little dialogue that had this list

00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,270
that you pick from and then you pass it

00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:23,260
back up to redraw though the whole poem

00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:25,059
right so initially I called the API to

00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:27,309
get the closest word here which is the

00:31:25,059 --> 00:31:29,230
obvious place like I click on a word I

00:31:27,309 --> 00:31:33,190
get the list of closest where it's super

00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:36,910
simple but to get the colors I had to do

00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:38,590
it up here and I was in promise hell so

00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:40,300
truthfully like anyone here who's

00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:44,980
actually good at react I wouldn't mind

00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:53,040
having a chat because react essentially

00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:53,040
is passing state is is this

00:31:58,030 --> 00:32:12,860
this is what my code looks like - I have

00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:14,900
like 18 functions yeah I have like 18

00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:17,320
functions called handle change it's

00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:17,320
insane

00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:21,680
all right so like I said the height the

00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:24,320
bash Oh Mike you are actually the

00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:25,820
coolest this is this is the original

00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,170
haiku the first cold shower

00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:29,600
even the monkey seems to want a little

00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:31,190
coat of straw I turned it in with one of

00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,050
the poetry models the last wet shower

00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:36,650
even the basil seems to try a little cap

00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:38,750
of dirt which i think is very haiku but

00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:40,700
then the last hot meteor even the lizard

00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:44,600
seems to need a little robe of guts is

00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:49,700
the Nerds of that version so I laughed

00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:51,770
all right so the parts of this project

00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:53,960
so making the words of act models is

00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:57,200
always easy with gentium and always fun

00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:58,520
when I decided to cut the poem and react

00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,700
so it's because essentially because I've

00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:03,770
been doing data science in like

00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:05,810
server-side Python for a little while

00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:07,670
now and haven't been making date of his

00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:11,210
apps I was like oh let's just use the

00:33:07,670 --> 00:33:13,430
tool to drawer but in fact this was a

00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:18,070
really complicated app to be my starter

00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:20,540
app and react learning curve was hard

00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:23,630
why isn't this updating and why is this

00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:25,520
updating too much was really hard and

00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:27,380
then at the point where I decided I had

00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:29,720
to get through the visualization by

00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:31,850
getting all of the distances upfront and

00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,890
then passing them back down to the

00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:38,390
dialog list that was really hard the

00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:40,190
promises handling was hard putting the

00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:43,190
actual color on each button was super

00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:46,130
easy d3 is fun and it's still fun and

00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:48,380
react I was glad to see and then at the

00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:50,360
at the end like last week I was like oh

00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:52,490
I'm gonna add a drop-down to change the

00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,320
poem add a drop-down to change the words

00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:58,580
effect muddle so I can get nerd Tyvek in

00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:00,890
there that was actually kind of easy so

00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:02,660
at that point I'm like maybe react is

00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:07,120
good for big projects where you need to

00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:09,670
make a little change okay

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,220
I think hooks would have helped which is

00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:18,010
the latest way of handling all the state

00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:20,320
passing so some related ki creativity

00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:22,470
work so we're moving away from my

00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,450
projects to sort of the bigger picture I

00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:27,940
really like that human-in-the-loop

00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:31,750
working with a model or a tool or a

00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:34,540
learned representation and for me the

00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:36,220
interesting AI art is the art where I

00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:38,850
got to do an awful lot of the

00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:42,790
customization of the authoring of the

00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:45,910
curation not just throw up a began model

00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:48,220
and then tweak one parameter so

00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:52,560
obviously if you're keeping up with the

00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:55,150
gp2 model big language generation models

00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:58,690
hugging faces right with transformer is

00:34:55,150 --> 00:35:02,470
an example where you can write with the

00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:03,640
GPT model I die still I still love it I

00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:10,660
mean I don't know if you've tried it but

00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:14,380
essentially it's a great app but alright

00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:16,180
so essentially we've got a starter text

00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,800
and then we get options that the model

00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:22,120
generated based on what I was trained

00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:23,410
with so Legolas and Gimli advanced on

00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,650
new york's raising their weapons with a

00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:28,150
harrowing work why but they're here is

00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:32,170
we're not to be defeated so that's

00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:34,950
that's it and then then you you start

00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:34,950
typing something

00:35:40,219 --> 00:35:48,960
hit tab and then you get what it would

00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:51,059
complete with a lot of times it's

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,099
nonsensical most times it's nonsensical

00:35:51,059 --> 00:35:56,039
even GPT - isn't very good at

00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:58,499
big-picture coherence and texts so for

00:35:56,039 --> 00:36:01,819
me this is still not like a superb

00:35:58,499 --> 00:36:04,469
creativity tool it's fun and funny and

00:36:01,819 --> 00:36:06,390
I'll probably add a slide to my deck

00:36:04,469 --> 00:36:07,829
after that's one of my favorite stories

00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:12,150
I created with it but it still has its

00:36:07,829 --> 00:36:15,660
issues okay in the visual space there's

00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:17,789
a lot more going on in videos Gogan demo

00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:21,450
is pretty cool so what you do is you

00:36:17,789 --> 00:36:23,369
draw with a pen that says like what are

00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:26,039
you drawing sky tree cloud mountain or

00:36:23,369 --> 00:36:29,009
whatever and then you tell it to turn it

00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:30,599
into a photorealistic picture and it

00:36:29,009 --> 00:36:33,569
does that based on what it's trained

00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:35,940
with so this is this is like my not very

00:36:33,569 --> 00:36:38,339
good trees turned into weird trees by an

00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:40,079
ocean with some hills so I like it

00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:42,150
because it's totally surreal but it's

00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,160
obviously not photo realism like it's

00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:45,869
it's surreal cos maybe because my input

00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,329
was bad or because of how it's putting

00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:50,819
it together and then like you can edit

00:36:48,329 --> 00:36:52,619
it again and get more get more stuff

00:36:50,819 --> 00:36:55,680
going on but it's still it's still not

00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:57,749
superb this is one of my favorites sorry

00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,940
about my Pinterest thing this is one of

00:36:57,749 --> 00:37:02,160
my favorites though Gann breeder is a

00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:04,710
very cool app this this person is

00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,650
updating it to do more things with it

00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:08,999
the way it works is this those were my

00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:11,789
pictures by the way I'm obsessed with

00:37:08,999 --> 00:37:13,589
generating castles I just want to build

00:37:11,789 --> 00:37:15,719
the coolest castle fortress tower

00:37:13,589 --> 00:37:18,390
whatever and that that's one of my

00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:21,690
obsessed obsessive goals okay so if you

00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:23,400
go to the gann breeder page and you can

00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:25,079
see sort of random things other people

00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,829
have created or that have come out of

00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:30,019
the app you can start from an image and

00:37:27,829 --> 00:37:33,900
then what it does is it generates

00:37:30,019 --> 00:37:37,380
children related to that image and you

00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:39,180
can edit the genes and you can see what

00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:43,969
went into this garden spider jellyfish

00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:47,210
sea anemone comic book consomme a soup

00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:47,210
bell pepper

00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:58,380
okay click on that get more children

00:37:55,010 --> 00:38:02,100
those are looking pretty actually okay

00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:04,700
I'm gonna save that anyway there's a bot

00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:08,070
that's posting cool ones from this and

00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:10,200
they're about to do major updates on the

00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:11,190
UI tools for this thing it's going to be

00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,800
great

00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:15,750
it's it's a super awesome tool but says

00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:18,330
it so this is a case of like a human in

00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:21,270
the loop editing generated model

00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:23,760
pictures I said I'm obsessed with

00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:25,500
castles so as soon as he's he or she

00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,480
said they were updating it I'm like more

00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:29,190
castles please because essentially

00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,480
there's like one category for castles

00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:33,020
and they aren't sufficient for me to

00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:37,020
like really make the castle of my dreams

00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:40,740
alright so so that brings us to some of

00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:42,660
my next points so doing this stuff fine

00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:44,760
make use cool datasets but be clever

00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:46,920
about it right like there's so much

00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:50,970
interesting data out there and you can

00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:52,860
make your own datasets finding fun

00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:54,450
datasets isn't actually that hard but

00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:56,640
there's two two resources I'm gonna

00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:58,320
point you to Jeremy Singer vines data is

00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,230
plural mailing list is awesome

00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:03,630
he's a data journalist and there's a big

00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:05,280
archive of all of his data sets out

00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:06,810
there and it's a great newsletter it was

00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,730
just a few short bullets with like a

00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:10,830
description and he loves weird datasets

00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:13,500
so that's super fun

00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:16,350
I also obsessively collect links to data

00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:18,840
set collections so my pin board which I

00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:22,590
update daily with my many open taps from

00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:24,180
Twitter there's a data set tagged some

00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:27,690
of it isn't gonna be obvious it's things

00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:28,830
like game game archives things like that

00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:30,390
so you're gonna look it and go why is

00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:31,980
that a data set it's a data set if

00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:35,400
you're a data scientist or a data

00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:39,540
goofer offer okay and you can obviously

00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:42,780
make your own data sets this is Josh

00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:45,870
Stephens who's a great map maker he did

00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:48,270
this now quite famous map of Bigfoot

00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:51,390
sightings in the US Bigfoot the

00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:53,190
abominable snowman the Yeti so there's

00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:54,750
like public data about this and he

00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:56,760
turned it into this map that was all

00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:58,440
over in lots and lots of articles at the

00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,780
time this wasn't for work it was goofing

00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:02,290
off

00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:07,760
and then he has over here a little like

00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:10,280
educational bivariate explainer about

00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:15,560
population versus sightings of Bigfoot

00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:17,870
which is super interesting okay uh pause

00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:21,920
the wizard this is one of my favorite

00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:24,140
weird examples so this is data you

00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,960
didn't know was data so just like me

00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:30,380
editing poetry so this is this guy Matt

00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:32,770
musi who alphabetized everything in The

00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,770
Wizard of Oz

00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,130
[Music]

00:40:57,740 --> 00:41:02,820
okay yeah so everything in here is

00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:04,530
alphabetized yeah

00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:19,380
so it's essentially alphabetical and

00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:24,240
then linear temporal sequence all right

00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:26,700
so obviously he used code to do this we

00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,869
could have done this right nah I'm just

00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:35,700
I'm kidding I wouldn't have done this

00:41:27,869 --> 00:41:38,640
but it's amazing so so one of the things

00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:40,020
about that that exercise is that as he

00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,300
said his appreciation for the film

00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:44,520
increased it's just like looking at the

00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:46,560
choice of a word in a poem and thinking

00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:49,200
could I do better could I turn it into

00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:52,830
mind when you look very closely at

00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:54,869
something using tools you you get you

00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:57,450
start to love how it was made you start

00:41:54,869 --> 00:41:59,310
to love the data doing things with

00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:03,180
artistic works is even better because

00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:07,410
you learn a lot about the art another

00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:10,800
interesting AI art projects so Viktor

00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:14,820
Dibya did this African mask curation

00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:17,880
projects so he hand curated zillions of

00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:19,770
pictures of african masks and then used

00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,020
it to generate new african masks with

00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:24,450
again so there's a good write-up and an

00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:26,130
interesting demo that he made this is a

00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:28,500
case of a passion project where you

00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:30,750
curate your own data set to do something

00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:34,020
interesting with it I'm working on

00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:37,349
gargoyles and castles obviously stay

00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:39,960
tuned and a Riddler

00:42:37,349 --> 00:42:41,940
so probably Luba Elliot is going to talk

00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,560
about these projects tomorrow so I'm not

00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:47,190
going into any detail but Anna Riddler

00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:48,990
took pictures of tulips and has a huge

00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:51,960
display of all the tulips used and then

00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:54,869
she used them for for the Netherlands to

00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:57,240
generate gann images of tulips that have

00:42:54,869 --> 00:43:02,310
never existed this is another hand

00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:04,560
curated beautiful collection Helena

00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:09,000
Seren makes really interesting gann art

00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:10,020
she also curates and collects and does

00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,180
her own

00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:14,609
her own imagery that she feeds into the

00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:16,140
Gann to make her own artwork I'm quite

00:43:14,609 --> 00:43:18,750
sure Luba will talk about this tomorrow

00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:22,290
I love her style it's very different

00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:25,080
from a lot of other Gann art so that

00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:26,400
said don't be a jerk when you're doing

00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,230
this kind of creative work using

00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,540
datasets other people created or

00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:34,680
inspiration from other people or poems

00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:38,940
or code give credit to your sources and

00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:43,440
inspirations and in particular don't be

00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:45,570
this guy hopefully we all know about

00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,190
deep nude this dude is like the

00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:48,690
algorithm only works with women because

00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:51,060
images of nude women are easier to find

00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:52,859
online but he's hoping to create a male

00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:56,190
version to [ __ ] he's not gonna make

00:43:52,859 --> 00:43:57,480
a male version okay and his his argument

00:43:56,190 --> 00:44:03,869
was if I don't do it someone else will

00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:06,810
do it in a year what be be smarter and

00:44:03,869 --> 00:44:10,950
be more interesting and and don't be

00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:12,330
offensive essentially so so the code was

00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:14,580
all over github because he said it was

00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:15,990
too late it was out there I heard saw

00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:18,599
yesterday last late last night that

00:44:15,990 --> 00:44:21,390
github is taking it down so good luck to

00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:22,859
them but you know there's a lot of

00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:24,450
really offensive things you can do just

00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:29,490
because they're easy that doesn't make

00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:31,349
them fun so this is an example of sort

00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:34,440
of a tired metaphor but it spoke to me

00:44:31,349 --> 00:44:37,050
so this is my patio and Leon I have lots

00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:38,520
of flowerpots on it there's a particular

00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:41,190
floor that I really like that's like

00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:44,640
essentially a weed that I cannot grow

00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:48,300
well in these pots I don't know what the

00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:50,849
deal is one seed fell off the edge you

00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:54,930
can see it sort of down here this is one

00:44:50,849 --> 00:44:57,599
plant it gets almost no Sun no rain and

00:44:54,930 --> 00:45:00,930
it fell on gravel and it did that

00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:04,560
that's one plan I can't put it in a pot

00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:06,240
and have that success but but sometimes

00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:09,150
the stuff you just throw out there that

00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:11,700
lands where you think is shitty is it

00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:13,050
does the best and that's one of the cool

00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,550
things about being creative and putting

00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:18,210
your stuff up there is that that

00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:21,240
sometimes sometimes it will put a flower

00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:24,520
in a place full of weeds I think you

00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:28,640
understand what I'm getting at

00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:30,590
so max krzeminski also has this reminder

00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,000
if inexperienced creators are using your

00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:33,470
tool to turn out loads of half-baked

00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:38,030
garbage your tool is a phenomenal

00:45:33,470 --> 00:45:39,800
success so true what we want is people

00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:43,250
to be making a lot of half-baked garbage

00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:45,350
and having a good time so what I would

00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:46,610
say as a takeaway is you if you find

00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:48,650
yourself playing with something you made

00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:50,420
and you're actually smiling or you're

00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:51,860
laughing at it and you're playing with

00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:54,440
it to check out something new you've

00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:57,890
definitely succeeded at a fun weekend

00:45:54,440 --> 00:46:00,020
hack and you want to make yourself and

00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:02,330
other people smile you don't want to be

00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:04,010
a jerk and you want to make the world a

00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:06,680
better place for yourself and for other

00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:08,300
people so I want to give some shout out

00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:11,000
thanks to this is not all of the open

00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:12,890
source projects I use but the particular

00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,750
helps for this the Bosch bot was really

00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:17,420
helpful Peter Baumgartner's just for

00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:19,040
making a you map display in plotly was

00:46:17,420 --> 00:46:23,050
an amazing help

00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:25,250
I used the students words of a KPI code

00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:27,950
which I could have written myself but I

00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:29,420
saved a bunch of time we can tack Peter

00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:31,880
Gastner helped me a little with react

00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:35,360
and this person helped a ton of people

00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:37,670
in a comment on the you map repo for how

00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:39,200
to actually get you map recognized in

00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:41,980
your Python project you can see how many

00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:45,530
people are super happy I'm the one here

00:46:41,980 --> 00:46:45,960
so anyway that's my talk thank you

00:46:45,530 --> 00:46:58,760
[Music]

00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:58,760
[Applause]

00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:05,079
Thank You Lynn

00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:08,079
thanks for a great keynote ah I guess

00:47:05,079 --> 00:47:10,869
you have many questions maybe arm but

00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:13,000
you're around until Thursday yeah I

00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:14,820
think let's talk over coffee so we don't

00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:18,669
yeah okay thank you very much

00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:18,669
