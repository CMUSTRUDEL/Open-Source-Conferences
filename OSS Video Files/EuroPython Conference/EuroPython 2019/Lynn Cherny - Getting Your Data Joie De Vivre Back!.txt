By Lynn Cherny

Most of us work too much and play too little.  When was the last time you smiled at something you made?  Playing with fun datasets, especially big data sets, opens up weird new forms of technical recreation.  Why not train an amusing model in a browser tab while you're waiting for that day-job Spark query to finish?  I'll show you some data toys I've built using AI and interesting data sets: Most of them involve both backend data science and front-end visualization tricks.  They range from poetry-composition helpers to game log analysis to image deconstruction and reconstruction. All of them taught me something, often about myself and what I like artistically, and sometimes about what ""big data"" actually means.
