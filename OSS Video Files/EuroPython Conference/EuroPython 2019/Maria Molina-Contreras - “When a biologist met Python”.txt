	"“When a biologist met Python”
[EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-11 - Singapore [PyData track]
[Basel, CH]

By Maria Molina-Contreras

Biology and computing are closer than we usually think, for example many algorithms are inspired in biology patterns, and complementary to that, researchers needs special algorithms to have a better understanding of our environment. Thus, there is a strong relation an dependency.
In the past years, Biology has been transformed into computational biology. Therefore
technological advances helps us to predict physical interactions between atoms and DNA, because we are being able to integrate information from biology into algorithms.

Python has become a popular programming language in biosciences because it has a clean syntax that makes it easy to read language. In addition to this, there are many modules (toolkits) extending to different biological domains, like metabolomics, structure analysis, phylogenomics, molecular biology and others. Python is currently improving researcher’s workflow, helping us to focus on the theory or experimental part, instead of fighting with old buggy applications. 

This talk aims to be oriented to all audiences (with/without biological background) since we will go together through an amazing adventure into the natural sciences using tools like Biopython, Bokeh, Networkx, Ecopy and much more! Are you brave enough to follow me on this journey?

	00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:11,210
thank you very much for coming um first

00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:14,059
thing that I would like to do is sharing

00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:17,050
my feelings because this is my first

00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:20,150
tech conference and I am really scared

00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:22,760
but at the same time I'm really excited

00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:27,640
to share with you what happened when a

00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:31,970
biologist met Python this biology is me

00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:34,310
I did a PhD in molecular biology and

00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:37,280
after a while I was a science

00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:40,809
if stay in academia or go to industry

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,550
and in this time I start to learn Python

00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:49,039
because I knew that it was useful for

00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:52,010
science and I need both I know I in this

00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:55,309
point I discover I start to discover

00:00:52,010 --> 00:01:01,100
some models and packages that was kind

00:00:55,309 --> 00:01:03,890
of amazing in that point I start to I

00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:07,760
don't know to have a kind of tribulation

00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:11,390
so while this is amazing why I didn't

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:14,480
start to use it before this moment well

00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:18,920
I decided to move to industry where I'm

00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:21,590
working as product manager ecommerce

00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:26,240
platform that we sell products or

00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:30,980
scientist and one of my role was looking

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,900
for nearest new resources in this case

00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:36,170
publication and it was in that moment

00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:40,580
when I realized and I discover some

00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:42,290
amazing tools but I thought why I cannot

00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:47,090
share with the wall

00:01:42,290 --> 00:01:53,690
this new discovered and that it's why I

00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:57,880
am here today well this this talk is not

00:01:53,690 --> 00:02:03,740
a conventional talk we're gonna have

00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:06,080
biological adventure but with Python

00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:09,399
that means that we are going to cover

00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:14,140
some different biological topics and

00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:16,069
hope Python can have a role in this as

00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:19,879
you can see well

00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:23,019
really different topics my first story

00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:26,900
it's about plants because plants are

00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:31,040
amazing they are there and they cannot

00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:35,599
go they can not speak but even that they

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:39,290
can communicate one of $8 imagine the

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:42,379
situation we are in our living room we

00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:46,189
have a plan but it's living there really

00:02:42,379 --> 00:02:50,769
happy and this plan perceived or see the

00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:54,829
light with two different kind of waves

00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:59,449
but we thought it's amazing situation

00:02:54,829 --> 00:03:01,489
but maybe I can buy a new plan I'm there

00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:05,000
because my plan is really happy there I

00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:07,480
can't have a know anyone near and in

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,909
this situation you arrive to your home

00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:15,250
you like your plan and the second plan

00:03:10,909 --> 00:03:21,699
also see the life to the same way but

00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:25,729
this plan also reflect a kind of wave

00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:29,120
saying that one plan can detect to

00:03:25,729 --> 00:03:31,849
another and they are started to be

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,209
unhappy because they aren't feeling that

00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:37,040
they are in dangers they need to survive

00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:41,090
because they are in competition for

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:45,319
light amazing topic if this was my topic

00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:47,750
of this is and imagine that you want to

00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:50,419
know about this syndrome but it's

00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:53,449
generated for this situation that is

00:03:50,419 --> 00:03:56,930
conveyed the void and syndrome and this

00:03:53,449 --> 00:04:00,620
is where Python can help us we can use

00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:04,040
this model called value Python to look

00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:08,629
for more information in this case it's a

00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:12,859
simple example where I am looking in a

00:04:08,629 --> 00:04:16,669
database called pmc as you can see in

00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:19,659
the line size and also I am looking for

00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:22,669
terms I choose this this database

00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:25,729
because contain open access publications

00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:27,830
but there are many other databases that

00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:29,180
you can look a lot of kind of

00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:33,500
information Tilly

00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:37,669
with different fields on in in science

00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:40,070
in general in the second part of the

00:04:37,669 --> 00:04:43,759
script we are doing a parsing of the

00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:47,300
information and then what we are going

00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:52,520
to change in this case is title and URL

00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:57,020
but again we cannot change piece of text

00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:59,930
and other information and we can see

00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:07,370
that this also has two different

00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:08,889
publications in open access journals

00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:12,710
sorry

00:05:08,889 --> 00:05:16,099
well sorry I mean I give you an espalier

00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:19,070
for to my metal story but I wanted to

00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:21,830
say the last thing remember if you have

00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:24,470
to plant really close at home give Lee

00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:28,729
give some space to them they will be

00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:31,310
happier make the story itself of a car

00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:33,919
because I woke up oh it is from all that

00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:38,870
era I don't know if you know that but

00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:44,630
this is the aspect that the primitive

00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:47,270
avocado was hot the the seed was huge

00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:50,539
and this was a really problematic issues

00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:55,840
because they it's really difficult the

00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:59,389
dispersion of this of this seed but

00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:02,360
thanks to this dynamo well not these two

00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:08,080
the grand-am grandparent but it was a

00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:13,780
Jungian slot around 4 meters of size

00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:16,909
that 800 kilos we have avocados nowadays

00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:19,250
but you can think yeah but this is an

00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:22,430
animal around 4 meters only about color

00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:26,210
it's enough well it was not enough for

00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:29,120
this animal he needs to eat avocados and

00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:33,050
other fruits and for that he needs to

00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,509
move around a lot and that was really

00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,909
useful for your colors because they was

00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:41,630
are a huge distribution of this fruit

00:06:37,909 --> 00:06:44,420
and go survive

00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:51,410
but in some point these animal disappear

00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:54,970
and but humanity appear and so we

00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:59,240
discovered that avocado were amazing

00:06:54,970 --> 00:07:01,700
nowadays avocados are a trendy food for

00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:04,900
me I am a bit worried about the prices

00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:09,310
of avocados because trendy food

00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:13,360
sometimes people increase the prices

00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:16,490
well for that I analyze the prices I

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:21,530
wanted to visualize the prices of

00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:25,760
avocados in a range of years with bacca

00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:29,030
bacca the model that allows us an

00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:33,710
interactive produced interactive plots

00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:37,310
in a really easy way of course this is a

00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:42,200
bit summarized I forget to tell you that

00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:44,570
we I summarize a bit the scripts because

00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,300
it's too long it's a lot of examples but

00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:51,470
all the information is available in my

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:54,010
github that I wanna give you later don't

00:07:51,470 --> 00:08:00,440
worry if you see that it's only some

00:07:54,010 --> 00:08:03,590
sure pieces of the skip well sorry as I

00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:07,450
was tell you it's really simple way to

00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:10,880
do it will read the data and then we

00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:14,060
choose the characteristics that we want

00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:21,740
to use in our the style that we want to

00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:27,410
use in our dots and lines and well we're

00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:36,400
gonna try to try oh well

00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:39,979
the dotted distribution of the prices in

00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:43,010
the lines is the average of the prices

00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:46,670
and the different colors that blue its

00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:49,420
organic and the red is conventional as

00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:52,760
you can see we have a different

00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:56,140
different prices but the tendency in

00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,140
time it's similar

00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:05,990
well these about avocados my next topic

00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:11,130
on our next story it's about virus

00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:14,670
because I because viruses are amazing

00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:17,130
organized but do you know that they

00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:19,350
still nowadays scientists are not sure

00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:23,180
if are alive or not

00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:28,710
it's kind of amazing topic but sometimes

00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:32,190
produce a lot of illness and a lot of

00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:36,840
problems this is a car the case of by

00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:39,590
Rosica that the information that we have

00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:43,590
nowadays it's that it's transmitted by

00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:48,030
mosquito and from the family is we don't

00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:51,420
have vaccination to prevent the the

00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:56,070
illness and because the symptoms we have

00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:59,940
if we are infected we can have fever

00:09:56,070 --> 00:10:04,220
rash and pain and the most serious and

00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:09,000
dangerous is microcephaly in newborns

00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:14,000
here it's the distribution of of the

00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:18,180
virus nowadays the most important

00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:23,610
thinking when we are talking about

00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:28,830
viruses or illness is how fast does it

00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:32,550
was played for that we can use networks

00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:37,860
but it's a model that help us to

00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:40,800
visualize the network to generate a

00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:46,380
network in this case we are going

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:50,010
analyzed cases of illness in Brazil the

00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:51,780
first we generate a graph or plot with

00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:53,430
different nodes that represent different

00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:56,640
cities of Brazil

00:10:53,430 --> 00:11:00,560
and we are gonna see how was the

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,560
evolution of the spirit of this virus

00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,920
let's see

00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:11,310
now well this is the difference the

00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:15,450
different cities we have different

00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:19,580
colors that represent the amount of of

00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:24,030
cases as you can see it's in range in

00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:29,370
every time that goes from quadrants to

00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:37,140
another grow the size of the of the ball

00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:40,080
and also change the color when I was

00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:45,860
preparing the talk I'm thinking wow it's

00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:45,860
amazing how Python can help biology but

00:11:48,830 --> 00:12:00,420
I can see also biology in Python how can

00:11:53,580 --> 00:12:02,760
this oh yeah I think that biology

00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:06,480
inspired computing and I want to share

00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:08,670
with you this point of view when it's

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,160
simple there are many of this example

00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:14,700
well one example is the Volusia nary

00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:17,670
allegory in specifically in this case

00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:20,790
this is one of that samples that I love

00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:24,420
it for that I chose it but it's ant

00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:28,740
colony optimization in this case is this

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:32,280
in ignant and can go to the nest to the

00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:35,790
to the food because they use pheromones

00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:39,120
and they can communicate one twin to

00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:43,050
another using pheromone communication

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:45,440
and this is really useful because when

00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:49,500
they have some travels in the way they

00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:52,710
rock or something they can say one or

00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:56,940
two you each other hey this is the easy

00:12:52,710 --> 00:13:00,810
way to arrive it or this is shorter way

00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:06,600
to do it this is a kind of optimization

00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:11,660
process and it's similar what good or

00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:14,670
it's the base of the of these algorithms

00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:17,310
but it's not the only one of course we

00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:20,209
have also the neural networks

00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:23,569
neural net worth is based in our brain

00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:27,649
specifically in neurons neurons

00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:32,759
communicate one or two each other with

00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:38,790
electrical impulse and go from one to

00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:41,220
each other imagine that we have an input

00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:44,069
you can't see something you'll receive

00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:46,829
information you have a input and then

00:13:44,069 --> 00:13:49,889
this information is going from one

00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:53,699
neuron to another one and then we can

00:13:49,889 --> 00:13:58,019
produce an output in this case or

00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:59,899
whatever it's the same idea that go that

00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:04,769
it's applying in artificial neural

00:13:59,899 --> 00:14:08,399
network but we need to have some things

00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:12,930
in mind that it's not exactly the same

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:16,079
but we are gonna do an experiment I

00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:20,970
think that it's momen to prepare

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:24,839
yourself because I want that I'm gonna

00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:29,639
show you a picture and I need the Duke

00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:32,670
card how many how many seconds do you

00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:38,069
need to recognize the object in this

00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:44,970
picture are you ready yeah okay let's go

00:14:38,069 --> 00:14:47,129
three two one do you need to go and

00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:58,110
second maybe it res you harm if you need

00:14:47,129 --> 00:15:03,870
one second more less less scientist

00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:07,949
it's the scribe that our brain needs 0.1

00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:11,370
second to recognize and not yet that you

00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:15,809
see it before that means that if you

00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:18,600
know this object you can use 0.1 seconds

00:15:15,809 --> 00:15:23,670
it's really fast it's really efficient

00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:26,399
our brain what what our brain on what

00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:29,370
our what is doing is analyzing this

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,610
picture we are analyzing shapes we're

00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:33,730
analyzing

00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:39,189
who analyzing by a small purse

00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:44,379
similar with this doing some machine

00:15:39,189 --> 00:15:50,889
learning I'm here I'm gonna talk a bit

00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:53,139
about PI torch model I don't I don't

00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:55,600
have a lot of information to say after

00:15:53,139 --> 00:15:58,959
the talk of yesterday I don't know if

00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:03,579
you were here but it was kind of amazing

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:07,239
okay explaining all about pie tart but I

00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:15,220
would like to only indicate two

00:16:07,239 --> 00:16:21,489
different important treat for me in this

00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:25,920
case a lot data set of flowers because

00:16:21,489 --> 00:16:31,360
we want to do we want to identify

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:34,749
flowers we are going to use a model

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:39,249
called resonate 50 that was pre trained

00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:42,009
it that this model it has a specific

00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:45,850
characteristic is basing pyramidal cells

00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:50,129
that mean that this the cells are not

00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:54,699
using layer by layer the cells is ago it

00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:59,949
can send information from one layer to

00:16:54,699 --> 00:17:04,510
another far away and this is what this

00:16:59,949 --> 00:17:09,189
model also do in this case we train and

00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:12,069
also evaluate and also test and here we

00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:16,299
have the results we have image

00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:21,370
classification with different plant

00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:26,429
species at some time this is amazing and

00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:30,100
was good but needs time and money and

00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:32,970
sometimes we don't have this time this

00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:36,309
is that sample this is the case for the

00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:38,980
next example but it's about the snakes

00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:42,909
and patter imagine that you have a

00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:44,040
friend who is on holidays and so two

00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:48,030
differences name

00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:51,720
take two pictures and and send to you

00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:54,960
this picture say a you know I know that

00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:58,050
you know biology and also Python can you

00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:02,210
help me evolve too if I am in danger

00:17:58,050 --> 00:18:07,730
it's fine the situation what I can do

00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:12,870
and of course this person sent to you a

00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:17,310
perfect pattern clear you know like real

00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:21,780
life real data amazing you can see all

00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:29,250
the pattern and for that we can use this

00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:35,100
model also this this model we can

00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:38,340
analyze the pixels of the images oh well

00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:40,650
we have another option because maybe you

00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:44,640
can't remember this poem that it's

00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:48,800
that's a red tote yellow kills the

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:53,640
fellow red tote black been on luck but

00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:55,770
maybe you have bad memory as me and you

00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:59,280
don't remember it goes kills the fellow

00:18:55,770 --> 00:19:03,630
kiss the fellow kill okay no better

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:08,000
using a script in Python it is safe in

00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:12,450
safety in this case we write an image I

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:18,260
generate three scales only to simplify I

00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:23,610
get a middle line of pixels and then I

00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:26,160
translate to obtain the colors and that

00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:31,080
it's what we have this is the image that

00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:35,070
your friend so in nature and this is the

00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:39,180
part that you obtain and after that you

00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:42,480
can say hey you are a face go to the

00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:46,410
right because the left it's a very nice

00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:50,790
one the biological strategy of this

00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:55,010
snake it's if this is not a banana snake

00:19:50,790 --> 00:20:00,010
its its neighbour imitate Oh

00:19:55,010 --> 00:20:07,610
the colors to be a safe of the Predators

00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:10,520
I'm sorry well my last story is called

00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:14,660
us happiness look like do you have an

00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:19,670
idiom do you have an idea who does

00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:24,110
happiness looks like now okay well first

00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:27,730
of all description of happiness overall

00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:32,950
appreciation of one's life as a whole

00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:37,160
well it's one definition of happiness

00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:41,090
but after that see I want to know what

00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:43,820
is the world happiness countries in this

00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:46,150
world basing that will happiness rapport

00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:49,460
of this year these at the top five

00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:54,080
countries if you are from one of these

00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:59,320
of these countries please share with all

00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:03,260
of us what is the sacred and please

00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:06,710
because we need to learn why and who

00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:10,370
arrived there well imagine that you want

00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:15,050
to visualize the happiness we can use

00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:20,210
this this model that is called our

00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:23,350
ticket and really easy way we can use

00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:28,610
the smile that it's a chemical formula

00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:33,380
we can transform these formulas and we

00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:36,770
can visualize the happiness here we have

00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:41,060
the for our hormones in humans that are

00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:45,730
related with happiness it's at all

00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:50,440
now we have a lot of models and packages

00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:56,590
related with biology and science only

00:21:50,440 --> 00:22:01,820
briefly two words about occupy occupy it

00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:07,629
it's a model use in ecology and we can

00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:11,460
measure the diversity the factors

00:22:07,629 --> 00:22:16,899
my take-home message are the full week

00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:20,259
for one - help - scientist innocent in

00:22:16,899 --> 00:22:25,629
this specific case in by l2 biologists

00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:28,600
as you see but biology is helping to

00:22:25,629 --> 00:22:34,359
computing or inspiring to computing and

00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:36,669
also to Python if we work together these

00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:41,820
scientists start to collaborate more

00:22:36,669 --> 00:22:46,059
with tech people and if we normalize

00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:48,759
Python in in science we can increase the

00:22:46,059 --> 00:22:52,299
diversity in the community and this

00:22:48,759 --> 00:22:55,539
enriched Python and enriched all of us

00:22:52,299 --> 00:23:01,619
and of course if you have some idea of

00:22:55,539 --> 00:23:01,619
model package please do it call our to

00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:08,289
generate more tools because even you

00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:11,289
think that it's not not so important

00:23:08,289 --> 00:23:15,399
really there are a lot of people who is

00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:18,159
using these tools and no no muslim well

00:23:15,399 --> 00:23:22,269
this is what happened with a biologist

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:25,149
made Python and I finished only saying

00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:30,639
that all the information it's available

00:23:25,149 --> 00:23:33,700
in my github oh and thank you very much

00:23:30,639 --> 00:23:34,480
and I hope that you enjoy the talk thank

00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:44,000
you

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:44,000
[Applause]

00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:09,310
when I was doing my apt I realized that

00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:14,050
there was a lot of manual tasks that was

00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:16,090
not has no sense to be in these years

00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:20,490
doing this test by heart or not

00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:23,590
automatically way and even I try to

00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:27,630
change introduced some changes you know

00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:33,250
the changes needs time and in academia

00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:37,830
is quite conservative and when I finish

00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:41,260
and I was with my own I decide to

00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:44,170
explore all these all these interests

00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:49,410
that I had to do the things more

00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:49,410
automatically and more effective way

00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:59,579
