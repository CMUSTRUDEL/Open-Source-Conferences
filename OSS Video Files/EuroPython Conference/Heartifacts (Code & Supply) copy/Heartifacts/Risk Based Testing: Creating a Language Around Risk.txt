let's talk

00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:08,760
this is going to be communicating risk

00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:12,150
by Jenny bramble and Dante

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:14,130
hi I'm Jenny currently I am a software

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:18,090
test creature over at a company called

00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:20,760
willow tree we make digital digital

00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:24,000
innovation agency we make mobile apps

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,080
for clients it is way more fun than I

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,539
thought it would ever be

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:30,050
that's not our office but I'm trying to

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:34,020
argue for a ball pit

00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:36,410
so my history I was originally a support

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,230
monkey I did support loved it

00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:41,820
accidentally got into DevOps hated it

00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:44,070
went running and screaming back to

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,860
support then kind of did this weird

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,479
support queue a kind of role and they

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,370
finally drugged me kicking and screaming

00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:53,330
into software testing how many software

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:57,239
testers do I have in the room oh yeah

00:00:53,330 --> 00:01:00,570
represent fantastic so that's where I'm

00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,729
coming from I am a QA creature that's

00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,700
how I define myself in my professional

00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:07,680
life and in my personal life I think of

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,979
myself as a tester and a questioner and

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,310
a seeker of things well enough about me

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:16,620
let's talk about risk oh right this is

00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,730
Dante he trapped himself in the bathroom

00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,730
for 12 hours once

00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:26,670
yeah that was a fun maintenance request

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,130
to the apartment so what are we gonna do

00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,600
today we are going to talk about a bunch

00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,670
of stuff first off we're gonna talk

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,120
about my job we're gonna talk about how

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,890
words are awful we're gonna define risk

00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:41,220
and we're going to talk about using that

00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:43,380
definition I might skip some slides I

00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:48,510
will totally provide them afterwards and

00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:51,450
you can be like oh we're not I can't

00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:54,240
test everything please don't ask me to

00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:56,400
test everything I was in grooming the

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,430
other day and my principal engineer goes

00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,840
weird or just everything and I'm like no

00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:04,260
maybe you want to test everything but

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,460
I'm not gonna test everything I can't my

00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:09,460
gosh

00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:12,179
my job I know you like nice things like

00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,179
the banana bed

00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:23,239
on the other side of a banana bed what

00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:25,340
is my job okay I ask questions I absorb

00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:27,500
the answers I translate those answers

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:29,360
from what I understand to what other

00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,099
people understand I talked to my

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,970
developers I talked to my software

00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:34,280
principals

00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:35,989
I talked to product owners I talked to

00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,340
clients I talked to random people on the

00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,340
street I talked to my mom

00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,360
I verified that systems under test

00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:47,500
perform in all the ways that the

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:50,170
stakeholders expect or help reset those

00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,760
expectations and I find that's becoming

00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,310
a larger and larger part of my job as

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,730
I'm becoming more senior if saying your

00:02:54,310 --> 00:03:01,379
expectations are a thing that you have

00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:05,200
you might need to think about though I

00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:06,879
hate other humans about testing and I'm

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,799
not sure I'll be able to have time to

00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,360
get to that in this talk but if you ever

00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:12,849
want to talk to me about what testing is

00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,560
I'm your girl also there's some other

00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:16,030
testers in the room they're also your

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,340
humans

00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:20,590
I advocate for quality practices

00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,390
methodologies and thought patterns again

00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,580
as I become more senior in my role I

00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,480
find my job becoming a little more

00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:29,440
abstract

00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:33,700
I don't do quality I promote quality I

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:36,970
advocate quality i defuse bombs usually

00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:40,730
those are human and I evaluate and

00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:43,430
communicate risk to the people around me

00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:44,380
Dante thinks my job also entails petting

00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,280
Dante

00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,560
yeah there's gonna be a lot of cat

00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:54,290
pictures in here if you don't like cats

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:56,450
I don't have anything for you okay

00:03:54,290 --> 00:04:02,270
everyone knows what risk is right we all

00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:06,319
know what risk is I like my coffee sweet

00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:10,130
my sister likes her coffee sweet if she

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:12,319
gave me sweet coffee I would die she

00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:16,160
likes a teaspoon of sugar in hers and I

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,600
like a sweet means two different things

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,260
to two people that are genetically

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,180
similar when I say risk it means one

00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,979
thing to me it means something entirely

00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,630
different to my product owner something

00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:30,289
entirely different to my developers

00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:33,439
something entirely different to my mom

00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:35,990
these words are terrible words are the

00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:38,899
absolute worst way that we could

00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:40,999
possibly communicate there's so much

00:04:38,899 --> 00:04:43,389
variability in them there's so much that

00:04:40,999 --> 00:04:46,369
makes them gooey and weird and squishy

00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:48,680
these terms have a lot of connotations

00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:52,309
to us personally and all the people

00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:55,809
around us and I can't really predict how

00:04:52,309 --> 00:04:55,809
you feel about certain words

00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:03,300
but we can define terms once we start

00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,670
defining terms we start being able to

00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:09,180
communicate across cross-functional

00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:11,790
teams we start using the same words but

00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,950
most importantly we're using the same

00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,300
meanings for those words if we're using

00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:18,480
different meanings they might as well be

00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:20,430
absolutely different words it gives us

00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,070
the ability to justify our decisions to

00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:25,500
people outside of our sphere and when I

00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:28,230
say sphere for me that means my group of

00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,360
testers I can now talk to my product

00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:32,160
owners I can talk to developers I can

00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,760
talk to random people I can talk to my

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,350
mom I really need to call my mom today

00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,540
and I can give updates that have depth

00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:43,410
and that have meaning and when I say

00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:45,090
depth I mean I'm not saying I listed I'm

00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:47,280
saying I tested this thing and I found

00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:49,590
it was risky I found this I found that

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,290
lease terms start to have meaning my

00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:54,600
status updates start to have more

00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:56,040
meaning I used to find myself a lot of

00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:59,250
times I'd be in scrum and I'd be like

00:05:56,040 --> 00:06:01,950
I'm testing today and they'd be like

00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:04,200
good job

00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:07,020
well yeah I'm testing how does it mean

00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,730
anything I could be walking out and

00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,710
getting milkshakes for everybody after

00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:12,330
all they know when I start defining

00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,370
terms when I start saying hey this is

00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,170
what I mean when I say I'm testing this

00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:18,420
is what I mean when I start freaking out

00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:20,370
about things that are risky it starts to

00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:24,150
have a little bit more color and make a

00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:25,890
little bit more sense and we can also

00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,780
start determining what resources we need

00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:29,130
to apply to a project that's gonna

00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,510
become a little bit more clear later

00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:33,960
that's sort of a weird place to put that

00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:36,620
bullet point note to self once we start

00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,620
to oh

00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:43,650
someone told me how to take myself

00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:45,480
seriously enough and I'm like we can

00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:47,160
communicate more clearly precisely

00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,440
because we all know what we're talking

00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,729
about my sister and I had a long

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,219
discussion about coffee

00:06:51,729 --> 00:06:56,770
for about a week and now she can make me

00:06:54,219 --> 00:06:58,500
a sweet coffee I can make her a sweet

00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:01,350
coffee

00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,040
and that's that's really improved our

00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:06,780
relationship blood gotta be honest

00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,730
Dante communicates exclusively with

00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,770
biting and crying

00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:14,750
lots of crime

00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:18,790
what is risk okay we're back to this

00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,790
topic again I love this topic biscuits

00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:26,900
it's a headline bug is running out of

00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:28,790
cat food it's everybody panic production

00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:32,110
is down we're all gonna get fired we're

00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:32,110
gonna have to work Donald's

00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:39,559
it could be anything it could be so much

00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:42,349
stuff and I'm super emotional

00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:45,289
I communicate almost exclusively through

00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:48,279
panic attacks and waving my arms like

00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:52,629
one of those things you see outside of

00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:52,629
yeah you're laughing because you like

00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:59,219
and for a long time I had a lot of

00:07:57,689 --> 00:08:02,129
trouble communicating with logical

00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:04,409
people a lot of the humans I work with

00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:06,749
think logically they think progressively

00:08:04,409 --> 00:08:08,069
they think in steps they say this is a

00:08:06,749 --> 00:08:09,300
thing this is a reason that thing

00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:15,050
happened let's fix that thing and I'm

00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:18,180
like and I would say things oh gosh oh

00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:22,169
poor baby Jenny I would say things like

00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:26,159
I feel bad about this this feature makes

00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:29,339
me sad I'm upset and the developers are

00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:32,900
like you were really squishy and weird

00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:34,820
and I don't know how to deal with you

00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,320
so I had to bring them into my spear I

00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:38,810
had to start teaching them about my

00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,630
emotion because that's the only way we

00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:43,849
could communicate I mean I was having

00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,529
trouble communicating logically and they

00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:48,760
could assign meanings to the things I

00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:48,760
would say like I feel bad

00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:53,750
once I started being able to think about

00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:56,180
defining terms and defining my gut

00:08:53,750 --> 00:09:00,800
instincts into actual phrases and words

00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:02,810
that were not just with me my wife got a

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,030
lot he used to hear everyone around me

00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:08,240
everybody's got a lot easier and a

00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:11,030
little bit quieter I'll be honest what

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,770
is risk risk is the impact of failure

00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:15,010
and the probability that that failure

00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:15,010
will occur

00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:21,720
so simple never take and a way that I

00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,399
could now say to my product owner I

00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,999
think this is risky I think this is

00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:26,999
dangerous

00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:29,910
I am worried this is why these two

00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:32,189
things make up this term that was

00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:34,450
nebulous before and now we've hardened

00:09:32,189 --> 00:09:37,680
it a bit

00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:41,899
Donn's it was like

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,899
don't worry I didn't give him anyone

00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,660
let's talk impact a failure any

00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:51,149
potential negative impact contributes to

00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:57,779
the risk of the application feature or

00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:59,819
use case there are so many different

00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:03,689
kinds of impact a lot of times we think

00:09:59,819 --> 00:10:07,889
impact is production goes down there's a

00:10:03,689 --> 00:10:10,829
hotfix there's an issue we can have a

00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:12,689
lot of different kinds of impact we can

00:10:10,829 --> 00:10:15,149
have technical lots of data and

00:10:12,689 --> 00:10:17,639
reduction of security flaws business

00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:19,379
what if revenue can't be collected what

00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:22,320
if critical functions can't be performed

00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:23,839
what if the CEOs name is misspelled

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:28,110
[Music]

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:30,059
we could have morale issues come up if a

00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,370
user has to utilize a workaround because

00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:35,819
of something we've introduced that's an

00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:37,589
impact my previous position most of our

00:10:35,819 --> 00:10:40,680
users actually worked across the street

00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:43,889
from us and we had a couple of pitchfork

00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:48,300
incidents fire no longer allowed the

00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:50,189
office you can also see slowed down

00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,509
workflows any of these impacts that

00:10:50,189 --> 00:10:55,079
people don't understand why they're

00:10:51,509 --> 00:10:58,139
happening is going to be an issue and

00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:59,819
that's gonna be a morale thing we would

00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:01,589
have some success when we explained to

00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:04,410
them that this workaround was gonna

00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:07,079
start having to be utilized but still

00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:09,269
it's an impact because they don't really

00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:13,769
understand why you were doing this to

00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:15,240
them and that's kind of a bummer when we

00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:16,860
started thinking about impact of failure

00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,110
we want to start determining what

00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:22,740
features the users look at the most what

00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:25,199
do they touch most often what happens if

00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:27,779
that fails are they gonna not be able to

00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:29,910
interact with the system are they going

00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:34,079
to lose data are we gonna lose money

00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:36,209
we'll some will literally die in case of

00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,629
like a medical thing it's it's a

00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:38,629
potentiality

00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:46,490
short what is impactful to the company

00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:50,090
what makes an impact on the company on

00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:54,350
the user's on the team on anyone that

00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:55,490
could be impacted Dante gets impacted

00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:58,639
leaving him for the weekend is

00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:01,100
everything falls off the table

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,730
also last time he dug a hole in one of

00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:07,100
my plans I got dirt all over the place

00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:09,499
clearly I needed Dante sitter let's talk

00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,449
probability of failure they likelihood

00:12:09,499 --> 00:12:14,559
that the application use case feature

00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:20,600
will fail seems pretty simple right

00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:22,009
it'll fail her I won't know so when we

00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,079
start talking about probability of

00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:27,829
failure we're making educated guesses we

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:31,610
don't know how likely it is to fail we

00:12:27,829 --> 00:12:33,589
guess but we have data that can help us

00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:36,559
tell if we're guessing in the right

00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:41,299
direction has it failed before as

00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:43,579
something similar failed do we have

00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:46,309
historical data in the form of defects a

00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:49,040
tribal knowledge RCA is QC a is anything

00:12:46,309 --> 00:12:50,449
like that that weird guy in the corner

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,429
that's been there forever and knows

00:12:50,449 --> 00:12:55,220
literally everything talked to that guy

00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:57,350
that's a great guy to know these things

00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:59,569
are gonna help us determine can this

00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:03,079
can't we guess if this is going to fail

00:12:59,569 --> 00:13:04,939
again we want to also ask how often two

00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:06,919
users interact with this is this

00:13:04,939 --> 00:13:09,980
something they are hitting every single

00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:11,600
day all the time then maybe we need to

00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:14,299
think a little bit more about the

00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,980
likelihood that it's gonna fail if we

00:13:14,299 --> 00:13:18,799
start if we start with this and if we

00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,850
miscalculate it then we started to put

00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,949
ourselves in kind of a weird position

00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:25,910
down the line we were like oh I didn't

00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:28,369
think it was gonna fail oops and that

00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:30,559
could be super uncomfortable one of the

00:13:28,369 --> 00:13:32,869
things I like to do there is talk to as

00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:35,149
many people as possible if you can see

00:13:32,869 --> 00:13:37,459
why a then you're in a way better

00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:39,799
position if you guess incorrectly and

00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:41,720
remember your failures remember if

00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:43,369
you've guessed incorrectly because

00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:47,470
that'll help you not guess incorrectly

00:13:43,369 --> 00:13:47,470
the next time something similar comes up

00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,910
again what use what features to users

00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:55,050
interact with the most how do they

00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:57,540
interact with them

00:13:55,050 --> 00:14:00,240
what's inherently fragile are there

00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:04,450
external changes to consider how do you

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,070
feel are you out of your features

00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:08,350
those are two questions that I like to

00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:10,240
ask developers and I like to ask product

00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:11,860
owners and I like to ask technical

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,250
requirements managers if I've got them

00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,250
on the team

00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:20,260
I find that there's not a lot of

00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,840
situations where we ask if we're proud

00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:27,730
of something unless it's failing if

00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:30,850
you're proud of what you're doing up it

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:32,610
can be really valuable it's okay you can

00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:35,020
laugh it's cool

00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:36,700
it can be really valuable to ask

00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:39,130
somebody if they're proud of a feature

00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,870
you would not believe the number of

00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:43,450
times I've gone to developers and said

00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:46,470
are you proud of us are you happy to be

00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,470
releasing it and they're like

00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:56,339
and you step back and you think let's

00:14:54,269 --> 00:15:01,380
run a few extra test cases open that bad

00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:03,060
boy when someone is proud of something

00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:04,769
when they're happy about it when their

00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,100
morale is high the quality of that

00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:09,899
product is generally going to be higher

00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:13,620
people ask all the time in quality

00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:16,140
assurance what is a metric we can use to

00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:18,510
evaluate your performance and someone in

00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:19,890
the back goes how many bugs and then the

00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:23,160
rest of the QA people start beating them

00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:25,709
up because that is the worst metric to

00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:28,560
ever use for anything quality assurance

00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:30,420
number of bugs is essentially pitting

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,820
two groups of people against each other

00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:36,690
against their will and that's not okay

00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:40,230
I'm super not okay when I was a baby QA

00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:42,060
monkey I used to I think I was playfully

00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:45,779
antagonistic with my developers it with

00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:50,370
me versus them and I always won and as

00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:52,680
I've gotten older I'm like because it's

00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:54,770
not me versus them it's an us thing and

00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:59,279
that's why my favorite Quality Assurance

00:15:54,770 --> 00:16:01,620
metric is morale if your team is happy

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,540
if you are generally Pleasant with each

00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:05,700
other if you generally like each other

00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:08,730
if you generally feel good about your

00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:11,459
product it probably has a pretty high

00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:14,610
amount of quality into it you can say

00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:16,350
yeah I'm proud of this it's probably

00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:17,279
pretty awesome unless you were working

00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,690
with terrible people

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,690
at which point we're hiring

00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:26,610
these are very educated guesses about

00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:29,620
what might fail you may get it wrong

00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:31,060
you're probably not going to because

00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,800
you're good at your job you know what

00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:35,970
you're doing you've done this before and

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:40,010
you've got people you can ask about it

00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:46,790
unlike Dante was very varied

00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:49,250
he fell off the roof doctors outside

00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:51,680
your feature use case or application can

00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,150
also contribute to risk and they're also

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,400
something that need to be talked about

00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:58,959
I say impact a failure and probability

00:16:55,400 --> 00:17:02,529
of failure and also

00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:04,390
other types of risk so there's a lot of

00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:08,010
things here this is not everything

00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:10,480
because everything is a huge number

00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:12,339
these are things I've run into in the

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,429
past six months

00:17:12,339 --> 00:17:17,529
modified timetable more time or less

00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:19,360
time a lot of times you're like Oh more

00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:22,870
time yeah we can do stuff it's gonna be

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,130
great no your developer is in the

00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:27,579
backend that you're refactoring

00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:29,320
something when you give people extra

00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:31,779
time they're like okay we can do more

00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:33,789
and if they're doing more that's

00:17:31,779 --> 00:17:35,260
potentially gonna increase risk because

00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:37,419
we weren't thinking about that from the

00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:39,070
start and if you weren't thinking about

00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:42,309
it from the start it can't really

00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:44,860
evaluate it I used to have a developer

00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:47,289
when I joined his team but team lead to

00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:54,940
me inside was like he's going to

00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:56,740
refactor something tell him no and that

00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,809
was really fun because he wanted to make

00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,429
a better product but we had to kind of

00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:02,470
rein that in so that we could make sure

00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:05,640
the features that we were contractually

00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:08,330
delivering were as good as possible I

00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:10,940
love that kid

00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:13,850
environmental issues changing anything

00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:16,039
on production on staging on dev is going

00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:17,720
to increase the risk a lot of times you

00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:19,580
don't think about staging as being a

00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:23,029
risky place but if it doesn't mirror

00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:26,330
production in exactly and it doesn't it

00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:28,190
can potentially be useless I saw some

00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:29,539
tweets coming through about a talk where

00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:32,090
someone kept saying over and over

00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:34,130
staging is useless and I need to hunt it

00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:36,230
down because that sounds really

00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:38,059
interesting and it also makes the hairs

00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:40,130
on the back of my neck rise up which is

00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:42,139
the sign of a good talk

00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:44,539
newer inexperienced team members can

00:18:42,139 --> 00:18:47,000
also be risky hi that's me I'm gonna

00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:51,620
take member I've only been at my job for

00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,450
a month and a half I know nothing I

00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:55,429
don't even know what I don't know and

00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:59,600
that's really kind of a cool place to be

00:18:55,429 --> 00:19:03,289
because I could to learn everything to

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,970
learn everything I've started taking -

00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:07,190
switching where I'm sitting so I can sit

00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:10,639
next to all the QA people it's getting

00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:12,799
super annoying but I love it natural

00:19:10,639 --> 00:19:15,080
disasters I'm from North Carolina

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,750
we have hurricanes we have terrible

00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,700
drainage there's been more than one time

00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:23,659
where I've been flooded in or out of the

00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:25,639
office with and without power if the

00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:29,419
power goes out in the office for my old

00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:31,549
job every staging server went down every

00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:34,220
team environment went down and parts of

00:19:31,549 --> 00:19:36,940
production stopped working don't think

00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:40,039
about that too much it hurts

00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:41,480
sickness had an entire scrub came out

00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:44,169
for three weeks because someone didn't

00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,519
get their flu shot get two flu shots and

00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:49,519
that's something you can't actually

00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,870
predict very well you never quite know

00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:53,770
when sickness like that it's gonna hit

00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:56,170
and sometimes it does

00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:59,950
outside pressure you see you know walks

00:19:56,170 --> 00:20:02,740
past like that thing do that thing or a

00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:04,870
VP or literally anybody that thinks they

00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:06,820
have a say in your life walks past tells

00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:09,610
you to do a thing and then

00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:12,010
industry-specific risks my old position

00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:13,390
was in digital marketing Facebook was

00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:15,490
generally considered a risk for us

00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:16,980
because they would randomly update their

00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:18,690
API

00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,520
I feel like okay so that thing you used

00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:22,169
to do yeah it's cool

00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:25,080
you don't need to do that thing yes we

00:20:22,169 --> 00:20:27,600
do we need to do that thing so that was

00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:31,760
that was a really interesting experience

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,760
they also didn't have a good sandbox

00:20:32,429 --> 00:20:36,749
I know baby it's a lot to think about

00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:39,470
yes it's necessary shout-out to

00:20:36,749 --> 00:20:39,470
Bojangles Oh

00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:46,910
Hey I am so sorry for literally everyone

00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,200
else in this room come down to North

00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:50,200
Carolina I will buy you a biscuit

00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:56,690
don't tweet that I don't need the entire

00:20:53,429 --> 00:20:56,690
Twitter verse asking me for

00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,900
yes it is absolutely necessary to talk

00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:07,380
about risk it's absolutely necessary to

00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:10,320
talk about this language we cannot test

00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:11,910
everything we have limited time limited

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,650
bodies limited resources limited

00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:18,960
attention spans

00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:21,120
I get bored super easily if you ask me

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:24,470
to test everything I'm not going to and

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:27,650
if I do I'm gonna do it really terribly

00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:30,660
once humans get bored we make mistakes

00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:33,000
you make all the mistakes and we don't

00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:35,570
realize we're making them and that's the

00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,580
main reason why testing everything is is

00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:41,420
kind of depressing because you know

00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:44,250
you're going to fail at it I'm a bummer

00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:46,080
so we assess risk we talk about the

00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:48,210
impact of failure we talk about the

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,890
probability of that failure we define

00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:51,510
these terms so that we can create this

00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:54,690
language so that we can start saying

00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:56,970
okay we can't test everything but we can

00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:58,830
test what's risky we can test what's

00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:01,640
important we can test what makes a

00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,640
difference in our lives

00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:08,929
well I think that's why I like three

00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:11,360
minutes ago what we can do is we can

00:22:08,929 --> 00:22:14,570
communicate clearly and precisely why we

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,940
test what we test I can say I'm doing

00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:19,850
this because it's risky and it's not

00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:22,220
just way the arm man freaking out about

00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:24,950
risk it's me having sat down with my

00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:27,620
team during grooming and said is this

00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:30,440
risky House has failed before what

00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:33,740
happened when it failed what could

00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:35,649
happen if it fails why are you not as

00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,960
scared about this as I am

00:22:35,649 --> 00:22:41,750
what do you know that I don't know you

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:45,529
get so much information by asking that

00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:47,210
ah and then the developer made fun of me

00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:48,620
for saying I was scared it's like it's

00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:54,110
just code and I'm like a little scary

00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:58,279
little letters I miss that guy and when

00:22:54,110 --> 00:23:00,320
I say test in my world I mean test I

00:22:58,279 --> 00:23:02,389
mean I do a thing I make a thing a test

00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,179
a thing I get the information back I

00:23:02,389 --> 00:23:07,340
relay it however this can also be giving

00:23:05,179 --> 00:23:09,860
more attention to one item than another

00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:12,260
item it could be raising concerns about

00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:15,019
a feature talking about needing more

00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:17,929
resources choosing what stories to play

00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:20,000
even and asking for more time and then

00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:23,840
wordy focus your manual and automated

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,750
efforts risk can be used to evaluate all

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:29,570
of these things you can use it to say

00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:32,240
hey I have a concern about this I think

00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:33,950
it's risky let me define these terms for

00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,630
you let me talk to you about them and

00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:37,549
then let's have this conversation

00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:40,039
between the two of us between the four

00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:43,519
of us between the eight of us as to what

00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:45,380
risk is and what we can do to mitigate

00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:48,140
it

00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:53,230
Oh Dante thinks we should have a serious

00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:55,340
oh no Dante just wants to take naps

00:23:53,230 --> 00:24:00,080
spoiler alert I picked that flooring

00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:02,360
color because it matched my cat normally

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,420
I dive into some risk matrix examples

00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:10,040
here I'm not gonna do that because as I

00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:13,520
guessed probably out of time but it

00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:15,830
exists it'll be in my slides and we can

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:19,580
talk about it at some point if you'd

00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:21,920
like to find me I'm super cool I promise

00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:24,350
so but the one thing I'm gonna leave you

00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:25,880
with on risk matrices a complex are

00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:28,010
simple they need to convey the correct

00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,110
information when we start making these

00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:32,780
we're talking about actually putting a

00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:34,580
number on the impact of the failure the

00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:37,430
probability of the failure and using

00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:40,190
that to determine where we go how we

00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:47,080
move forward I do want to tell you a

00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:47,080
story because this one's true

00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:55,520
imagine this my team is in a room

00:24:51,409 --> 00:24:58,159
together we are happy creatures we are

00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:02,179
sitting around a table a product owner

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:04,580
sitting across the table from me and my

00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:07,220
team lead says we can't release this

00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:09,620
project and my product owner goes why

00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:13,549
can't we release this product it was in

00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:16,850
alpha for like a year and we've had it

00:25:13,549 --> 00:25:19,460
in beta for like three months you guys

00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:21,620
have had so much time why can't we

00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:24,460
release its product we all kind of

00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:28,360
looked around and I said

00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:29,560
this product was a good girl went to

00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,960
college fell in with the wrong crowd

00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:34,930
started drinking needs to go to rehab

00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:37,800
listen to the public and he looked down

00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:46,270
and he looked up he's like yeah I

00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:48,280
understand that what I meant was we got

00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:50,530
deep into this project we found that

00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:52,360
there was significant amount of bugs a

00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:54,160
significant amount of refactoring and

00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,650
some reap architecting that had to

00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:59,500
happen for it to even freak and run on

00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:01,750
our production servers and that was

00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,850
insane it was so much more work than we

00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:06,010
thought it was going to be and then we

00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:07,750
demoed it for the users and they told us

00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:10,690
they wouldn't use it

00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:13,120
and we're like um do you guys approve

00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:18,190
the design approve the design they're

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:21,210
like we haven't seen this a year no

00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:21,210
one's talked to you

00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:26,570
panic attacks I was having them other

00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:28,340
people were having them it was one of

00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:29,510
those situations where the VP of

00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:35,060
engineering walked into the room and

00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:38,630
it's like oh we're doing that's right we

00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:41,210
can't do this what we did was we started

00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:43,280
creating a risk matrix we step back and

00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:46,010
we said okay what are the things that

00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:48,950
have gone wrong what are the bugs what's

00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:52,690
the impact of those bugs what does it

00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:55,809
look like if we let them out

00:26:52,690 --> 00:26:57,879
we decided on these different terms we

00:26:55,809 --> 00:27:00,820
wanted to say what's the risk to the

00:26:57,879 --> 00:27:03,039
user of catastrophic failure what's the

00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:05,950
risk to engineering of significant

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:09,309
technical debt what's the risk to the

00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:11,649
team's morale of failing Sprint's having

00:27:09,309 --> 00:27:15,009
hot fixes anything that would drag us

00:27:11,649 --> 00:27:16,929
down and then we also said when can we

00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:19,659
fix these issues is it something that

00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:21,399
has to be fixed before we hit prod is it

00:27:19,659 --> 00:27:24,249
something we can take care of afterwards

00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:26,950
if given the time and I also argued for

00:27:24,249 --> 00:27:28,359
a pitchfork index which is how upset I

00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:32,080
felt the users were gonna be if we

00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:35,200
didn't fix some bugs it's very important

00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:37,029
to me that people in my groups and might

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,460
tell my teams understand that they are

00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:41,440
not just making things because they were

00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:44,509
told to make a thing they're making a

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,820
thing because a person needs it

00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:50,419
and if nobody needs your product why are

00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:52,369
you making so no one agreed with my

00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:54,709
pitch work index but I kept bringing it

00:27:52,369 --> 00:27:56,949
up and they started laughing at me which

00:27:54,709 --> 00:28:00,320
is fine I'm cool with that

00:27:56,949 --> 00:28:02,329
so we were able to actually get out in

00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:06,169
front of our VP of engineering and say

00:28:02,329 --> 00:28:08,570
hey this is why we can't release this is

00:28:06,169 --> 00:28:12,499
why this can no longer be a q2 goal for

00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:14,269
us we have reasons we have words we have

00:28:12,499 --> 00:28:18,589
meanings we have definition we built

00:28:14,269 --> 00:28:20,749
trust with him and said hey this is what

00:28:18,589 --> 00:28:22,339
we've got we're not going to put it on

00:28:20,749 --> 00:28:25,940
the rod we're not going to lie to you

00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:28,909
we're going to give you actual numbers

00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:30,640
that tell you how badly feel and he was

00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:34,360
like

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,870
q for then and that was a huge win for

00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:37,809
us

00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:40,000
because we actually got the time to talk

00:28:37,809 --> 00:28:43,840
to the users make the design that they

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:46,900
would use and fix a lot of the bugs and

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:49,230
then I quit my job supposedly and went

00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,230
well though

00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:54,420
and of course Dante always discuss risk

00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,250
with everyone involved

00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:58,490
no birds were harmed in the making of

00:28:56,250 --> 00:29:01,080
the presentation here's your opossum

00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:02,910
apologize the previous slide usually has

00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:06,390
a picture of Dante and opossums they're

00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:09,080
super cute I'm running out of time so

00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:12,499
I'm gonna do this super quick

00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:14,720
if we talk about risk the more we do it

00:29:12,499 --> 00:29:17,149
the more cohesive our team is going to

00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,100
be one of the fundamental things of

00:29:17,149 --> 00:29:21,080
building a team of building a tribe of

00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:23,779
building a group of people is to give

00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,460
them a language that is their own to

00:29:23,779 --> 00:29:27,470
give them something that when they say

00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:31,220
it to each other they're like ah I know

00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:33,650
what that means a little in joke

00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:36,140
a little out joke a little slightly

00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:38,600
inappropriate joke some way to describe

00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:41,450
something that you do is a team that is

00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:43,740
unique to that team the language of risk

00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:45,450
can be that for your team

00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:48,180
it's great to have other funnier things

00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:50,940
that are quite serious

00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:54,559
one of my other teams we look at each

00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:59,010
other we're like you're eating ants and

00:29:54,559 --> 00:30:01,260
people are like what it's a term that we

00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:02,580
came up with to describe somebody doing

00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:05,970
something silly because they're being

00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:07,710
unattended like when you're at a family

00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:09,210
reunion and there's that one

00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:10,830
three-year-old in the corner that no

00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:12,510
one's paying attention to and they're

00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:15,809
eating ants because of course that

00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:17,400
darker so we would say things like that

00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:19,140
and that was our team's internal

00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,960
language don't tell them I told you

00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:25,710
about ants but we can look at each other

00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:28,380
be like huh and everyone would laugh no

00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:30,900
one else would laugh we were a team risk

00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:33,330
does the same thing we become better we

00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:38,000
become more cohesive we start making

00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:38,000
better things cooler things

00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:42,559
we can use it for more thoughtful

00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:45,780
testing and more thoughtful

00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:48,230
conversations we build trust by building

00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:48,230
language

00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:54,920
I know baby he gets overwhelmed by

00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:57,640
thinking about risk to be fair he gets

00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,640
overwhelmed

00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:04,400
oh there goes that's my presentation my

00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,180
darlings I hope you enjoyed it I hope

00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,400
you learned something about

00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:09,890
communication something about risk I

00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:12,110
have put a few conversation starters up

00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:15,020
here because we are getting ready to go

00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:16,420
to the party it's gonna be super fun I'm

00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,680
super excited

00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:21,110
think about some of these things ask

00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:23,600
some random person in the audience one

00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:25,870
of these questions or ask me or ask

00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,820
somebody in a blue shirt

00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:29,470
start to talk about language start to

00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,970
think about language start to think

00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:34,740
about emotions and start to think about

00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:34,740
