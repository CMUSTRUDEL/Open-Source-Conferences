Title: How Not to Review a Pull Request
Publication date: 2018-05-25
Playlist: Heartifacts
Description: 
	There are many opinions and techniques for reviewing code. Instead of boring you to death with another philosophical rant, we will explore what not to say to your co-workers through examples. Once our journey is complete, we will have tools to help recognize these non-constructive behaviors before hitting send. Areas of interest will include team trust and safety, active and passive aggression, and creativity blockers.

tada

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:14,250
all right so who in this room doesn't

00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:17,400
know what a pull request is oh there's

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:21,420
at least one perfect - all right so a

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:24,150
pull request is essentially the it's the

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:26,550
github word for it really for just

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,699
requesting a code review for some sort

00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:31,019
of change and in reality I was talking

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,290
to a few people I think it was during

00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:37,110
lunch or at another or last night I

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:39,210
don't remember and there was some

00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,100
conversation about how people had used

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,200
github for like planning their wedding

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,079
so that that's kind of a completely

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:49,559
different way to do it so we're gonna

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,260
we're gonna dive into pull requests I'm

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,390
just using as a very general term for

00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,629
just if you're in a situation where you

00:00:54,390 --> 00:01:02,609
deal with a code review and it sucks so

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:06,810
to to start out that is a live github

00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:08,970
repo so github comm /au Smith slash how

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,860
not to review a pull request if you want

00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,810
a copy of the slides because I will have

00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:18,119
some links in them this way maybe you

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:21,060
don't take pictures so let's look at a

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:24,659
maybe possibly decent pull request

00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:28,170
comment so here I'm specifically

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:32,159
pointing out hey these are you may not

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:34,439
want to do this you may not want to use

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,299
the same ID here because here's a link

00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,960
to the documentation that says how we

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:42,240
can't do that the action items are very

00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,579
clear for a person and this is the last

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,899
good comment that's going to be in this

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:51,210
entire presentation alright so in my

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:54,920
professional career so far I have seen

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:58,229
four types of code review behavior

00:01:54,920 --> 00:02:01,790
there's Tim and code reviews so they're

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:04,619
going to be or rather rabbits it's so

00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:08,580
questioning their statements in the code

00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:11,009
review may lack conviction so it's hard

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,620
to determine exactly what to take is the

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:17,280
action item from them

00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:20,340
then there's idealist that they're

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,420
probably not really eating your code

00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,110
they're probably a little more

00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:30,150
interested in their solution for the

00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:33,269
problem then there's Spartans so they're

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:36,300
going to be a little bit more terse hard

00:02:33,269 --> 00:02:37,500
to get further information from maybe

00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,989
their comment was just straight-up

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,790
missing information or maybe it was just

00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:43,790
something really short like fix this

00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:52,829
then there's tornadoes so these would be

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:56,040
a bit more indiscriminate so like so

00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:58,079
when you submit a pull request on github

00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,120
it will actually highlight like trailing

00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:01,860
whitespace let's say you accidentally

00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,110
did that a bunch of times in your pull

00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:09,650
request and then you had a tornado come

00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:09,650
along and comment on every single one

00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:16,650
sometimes a little overzealous so these

00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,180
are these are especially more

00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:27,690
entertaining when you start to combine

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:29,280
them so so like someone who's not that

00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,319
they don't their comments don't have a

00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,590
lot of conviction but they could come in

00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:39,480
on absolutely everything

00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:41,489
or maybe Spartan ID lists so not only

00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,620
were they too terse to understand what

00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:47,540
the heck they wanted from you but they

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:51,630
also only cared about their solution or

00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:57,269
Spartan an idealist rabbit alright we've

00:03:51,630 --> 00:04:00,720
exceeded my photoshop skills so let's

00:03:57,269 --> 00:04:02,370
look at some actual code comments you

00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,349
may notice throughout this presentation

00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:08,900
from here on out there's a little little

00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:08,900
cat personas those are actually my cats

00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:17,049
fun aside my partner bought that little

00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:21,850
outfit for our cat just support this

00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:25,300
presentation okay

00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:27,670
so let's say business cat here is is my

00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:30,580
engineering manager and I just submitted

00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:34,390
this this code change that has this

00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:37,060
changing operating systems and so they

00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:39,550
comment did you even read the memos so

00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,050
at this point I'm totally frantically

00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,640
reading through my emails trying to

00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:44,800
figure out what the hell I missed from

00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,680
my manager and wondering whether or not

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,490
it's going to come up in my next review

00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,960
or have I if I submitted an open source

00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:56,170
change and I was just straight-up told

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:59,260
delete your account I kind of I kind of

00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:02,590
don't feel okay with that one and I

00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:04,510
statement I don't feel okay with this or

00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:06,820
or if someone just said why would you

00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:09,550
even do this like me reading that I'm

00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:12,610
totally like why would you even do this

00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:16,540
right like that the connotation sucks

00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:20,290
there and it's not like I went out there

00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:22,420
and and had this as the title of my pull

00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:24,910
request though you may actually notice

00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,650
if you go to that github repo reference

00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:28,390
at the beginning that this is actually

00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:31,780
the title of one pull request on that

00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:33,730
repo this is not typically what were

00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:37,150
what we're seeking when we submit a code

00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:39,340
change right let's look at a few more

00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:44,470
that are on the more passive aggressive

00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:45,550
side like just fix this so all right

00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:47,500
sure

00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:49,840
I happen to know just because the

00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:51,130
Spelling's very obviously wrong here but

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,230
what if that was a slightly more

00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:58,120
abstract situation or on that same

00:05:55,230 --> 00:06:00,970
really like code change maybe change

00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,880
this to do something useful yeah that

00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:06,990
doesn't feel great or how about just a

00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,990
link to the correct spelling

00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,830
the the second comment there whatever

00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:15,870
this is fine totally would have been

00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,849
acceptable and made me feel just as

00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:22,949
badly if they had done that this is fine

00:06:17,849 --> 00:06:28,469
dog or have it this is not bad for

00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:30,719
someone in your position I so so notice

00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:34,409
that all of these were totally attacking

00:06:30,719 --> 00:06:36,419
the reveal the actual author of the

00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:39,210
change and they weren't focused on the

00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:43,590
actual code that we were upset trying to

00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:46,020
make changes to what was nice about not

00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:49,340
being first in heart effects today is

00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:52,250
that multiple people but John and Aisha

00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:55,439
mentioned taking a deep breath and

00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:59,189
that's gonna be kind of our focus here

00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:02,490
so that concept is called active pausing

00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:04,349
so it's while the definitions vary it's

00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:06,680
basically just taking a step back

00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:11,419
recognizing that you feel an emotion and

00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:13,710
figuring out how it's impacting you so

00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:16,529
one example is taking a deep breath

00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:19,469
right or this might manifest in the form

00:07:16,529 --> 00:07:23,069
of you do taking a five minute walk

00:07:19,469 --> 00:07:24,839
before before giving a response or maybe

00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:27,479
you pause before responding to an email

00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:30,629
like you write out all of your all of

00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:32,190
your feedback and then you just minimize

00:07:30,629 --> 00:07:34,430
that window and come back to it in half

00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,430
an hour

00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:39,779
the goal here is not to bottle it up

00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:41,279
it's not to say okay so I felt that

00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:42,990
emotion so now I'm going to completely

00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:46,830
ignore it and I'm never going to go and

00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:48,839
do that fit on on the mattress in the

00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:51,870
middle of my living room later like John

00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:54,000
was describing it's instead to identify

00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:56,819
what emotions you were feeling consider

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,379
why you feel those emotions think about

00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:00,210
your desired outcome and that one's

00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:02,370
important you need to think about what

00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:04,379
you want to happen with your follow-up

00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:06,060
interaction with them and then choose

00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:11,310
the responses most likely to achieve

00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:12,990
that outcome if you're interested in

00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:14,789
reading more about active pausing the

00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:17,460
first two are more focused on the

00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:19,979
definition and the last link there is

00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,660
talking about some physical exercises

00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:25,080
that you can do like stress Falls and

00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:29,190
the like alright so let's talk about

00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:31,440
typos sometime they can be totally

00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:39,360
harmlessly funny like take capsule till

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:43,740
dead or embarrassing we remember all who

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:47,640
served hot breakfast who has served a

00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:51,650
practice or downright insulting like the

00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:53,790
lyndon b johnson school of pubic affairs

00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:55,980
fun story about this one

00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:58,650
so lyndon b johnson school apparently

00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,000
issued an official apology and sent out

00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:04,020
new copies of the commencement program

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:08,940
afterwards that was nice of them so how

00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:10,230
did how can typos i mean i don't know

00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,779
that i would have wanted to keep that

00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:16,950
but I probably would have burned it and

00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:19,770
enjoyed that cathartic experience so how

00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:22,890
can that actually affect a comment in a

00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:25,140
code review we have made the mistake of

00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:27,410
over complicating things before we

00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:30,330
should now make this mistake again I

00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:34,650
think they meant we should not make this

00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:36,600
mistake again and assuming this is my

00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:38,880
engineering manager it's got double

00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:43,200
meaning like do they want us to over

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,850
complicate I don't know my point though

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,660
is the written communication presents

00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:52,740
many avenues to misinterpretation typos

00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:54,570
like you on all the points I think

00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:58,470
that was supposed to be you hit on all

00:09:54,570 --> 00:10:01,550
the points I think connotations

00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:05,310
important like what an innocent change

00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:11,190
so so was I supposed to know better is

00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:14,370
that an insult or emphasis like when

00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:17,430
someone writes why not try X I might

00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:20,400
read why not try X like questioning me

00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:24,390
or or why not try X like hey maybe this

00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:28,019
is a better solution or commas are

00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:29,939
really really important so

00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:32,009
I I definitely did a double take when

00:10:29,939 --> 00:10:34,379
this one showed up in an email a couple

00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:38,399
weeks ago I have too soon to be three

00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:41,309
children and wife I'm not sure if they

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:45,389
wanted to say sons I'm also not sure if

00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:47,279
they need if it's a white so so I'm

00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:54,269
assuming they meant I have too soon to

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:58,199
be three children and a wife I think all

00:10:54,269 --> 00:11:01,860
right let's go back to this so hey

00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:10,799
delete your account that sucks right

00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:13,199
or how about what were you thinking this

00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:15,899
is more like Darth Vader from episode

00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:22,739
three in Star Wars right just shouting

00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:25,170
at the sky so exactly so this one

00:11:22,739 --> 00:11:26,699
actually has a interesting story and

00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:31,040
it's one of the few non fictional

00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:34,410
comments in here so I was being told I

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:37,769
went out asking others co-workers and

00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:40,529
friends of some examples of bad code

00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:45,179
review experiences they had had and this

00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:47,100
was a college friend said that they had

00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:49,980
just graduated they were there first

00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:51,809
week into their job and they submit this

00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,999
and they're excited and they submit

00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:56,639
their first code change they submit

00:11:53,999 --> 00:12:00,089
their first pull request and this is a

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:03,869
5200 person company and this is this is

00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:08,749
the comment that her CEO pops into this

00:12:03,869 --> 00:12:11,160
first pull request their their

00:12:08,749 --> 00:12:15,299
self-confidence is shattered at this

00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:17,100
point right how about I would consider

00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:20,850
your solution if you had senior in your

00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:23,100
title I'm seriously not sure why senior

00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:25,499
in my title would matter it all here

00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:28,939
this one is not a true story by the way

00:12:25,499 --> 00:12:28,939
well for me

00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:35,780
so these boil down to the concept of

00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:38,750
psychological safety which is talk which

00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:41,270
came up as one of as the number one key

00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:44,180
factor for a successful team at Google

00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:47,030
after they did an internal study I

00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:49,580
believe the year was 2012 and it's the

00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:54,130
concept of can we take risks on our team

00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:54,130
without feeling insecure embarrassed

00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:59,210
Alex harms so earlier this week there

00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,770
were apparently a few conferences

00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:04,070
earlier this week

00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:06,740
besides rails comp so DevOps days in

00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:09,650
Atlanta was Tuesday Wednesday this week

00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:11,660
and Alex harms did this really good

00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:16,040
presentation which I highly encourage

00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:18,920
you checking out called psychological

00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:21,980
safety the hard part and she had this

00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:24,560
really good comment saying of nobody wow

00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:29,440
I spilled nobody wrong nobody sets out

00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:32,840
to do the wrong thing that's impressive

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:44,360
all right I think that one's not

00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:46,130
intentional right also if you want to

00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,910
see an absolutely awesome presentation I

00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:52,000
recommend that Vimeo link because she is

00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:55,640
presenting at the lean agile Scotland

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,530
conference and her slides end up not

00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,390
working so she ends up doing the entire

00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:00,500
presentation without slots which was

00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:05,230
freaking awesome

00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:05,230
similar to the talk we just did actually

00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:15,360
and with without this sense of safety we

00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:18,629
tend to we tend to see teams have a

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,249
breakdown of creativity and and support

00:14:18,629 --> 00:14:23,699
within the team and the result is

00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:25,379
usually a decrease in productivity that

00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:29,160
link is from an O'Reilly conference

00:14:25,379 --> 00:14:35,850
where a slack manager came in with a a

00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:38,370
slack join slack as a manager and they

00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:40,350
had a product that they had to produce

00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:42,959
within two months of her joining the

00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:47,279
company and this is where I was first

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:49,470
exposed to psychological safety all

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,720
right let's go back to some some code

00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:54,059
comments you should initialize this

00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,759
variable before entering the loop all

00:14:54,059 --> 00:15:01,670
right well I'm pretty sure I did that on

00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:05,999
line 15 so did you miss it

00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:07,949
or maybe suggesting that for Charen

00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:10,439
characters should be for see in

00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:14,240
characters like that that seems a little

00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:18,120
pedantic or how about the the

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:21,930
all-important naming problem where they

00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:26,610
just kind of generally I'm not sure they

00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:30,199
read the actual code at this point so

00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:32,309
for me these boil down to a concept

00:15:30,199 --> 00:15:37,559
called trust but verify

00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:41,040
where if for example this individual had

00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:42,980
instead trusted the the person who wrote

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:46,139
the code to have at least run it once

00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:49,860
they probably would have known that hey

00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:51,809
it was already initialized first this

00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,429
concept where you're willing to you're

00:15:51,809 --> 00:15:55,470
willing to trust your teammates like you

00:15:53,429 --> 00:15:58,679
hired them right so you're willing to

00:15:55,470 --> 00:16:01,589
trust your teammates and also verify

00:15:58,679 --> 00:16:03,449
what they what they did I think this

00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:06,209
applies to both technical and human

00:16:03,449 --> 00:16:09,269
problems personally and I tried to apply

00:16:06,209 --> 00:16:12,839
it to my everyday a recent example of

00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:14,429
this was a co-worker of mine was

00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:18,370
fighting with the technology called

00:16:14,429 --> 00:16:20,110
rabbitmq and he had been handed some

00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:23,710
he had been handed a set of certificates

00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:25,690
from another team who was who had tasked

00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:27,520
us with spinning up the RabbitMQ server

00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,900
and he was bashing his head against the

00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,360
problem for like three days where it

00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:33,670
just wouldn't run and then he realized

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,670
that the certificates he was handed were

00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:38,580
actually bad but it took three days of

00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:40,870
troubleshooting for him to find that so

00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:43,210
totally trusted the other guy to do the

00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:48,880
right thing but forgot to do the

00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:50,529
verification step this sort of comment

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,620
like what test cases has it been

00:16:50,529 --> 00:16:56,680
verified against I I encourage everybody

00:16:53,620 --> 00:17:00,130
to put that sort of review comment in

00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:07,000
code reviews this doesn't need to be

00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:11,230
fictional all right so let's say the

00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:15,819
count see here just just missed it let's

00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:18,069
give them the benefit of the doubt we're

00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:22,050
all human we all make mistakes we're

00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:22,050
emotional beings happens

00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:27,880
Adam Osbourne who I didn't learn about

00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:31,300
until I started putting together this

00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:33,730
presentation looking for good quotes he

00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,890
he said people think computers will keep

00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:38,700
them from making mistakes they're wrong

00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:42,340
with computers you make mistakes faster

00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:44,800
and this kind of lines up with the with

00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:47,830
the mentality today that we should fail

00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:51,400
fast right though I kind of disagree

00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:54,490
with the concept of we we use computers

00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,690
to fail more I don't like that idea but

00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,460
I definitely like the rest of the

00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:59,770
concept and if you're curious about Adam

00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:02,230
Osborne apparently in 1981 he was

00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:05,559
working on portable computers so that

00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:08,170
was cool all right so what I hope you

00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:10,450
take away from this presentation active

00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:12,490
pausing is really really useful for

00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:15,370
being able to get to a positive outcome

00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:18,160
when you start to feel emotional or feel

00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:21,070
an emotion not emotional written

00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,730
communications are really hard and

00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:25,960
really easy to misinterpret

00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:29,470
psychological safety helps teams be

00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:32,140
productive so creating that safe space

00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:36,190
for other people it's really important

00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:41,770
I trust but verify you'll be happier I

00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:44,320
promise and we all make mistakes the

00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:47,800
obligatory slide of a lot of links and

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,120
why I made this into a github repo in

00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,040
the first place because I didn't want

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:55,450
people be like what the hell are all

00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:57,640
these links the first two are focused

00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:01,980
around the code review process itself

00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:06,010
that very first one actually is a great

00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:07,660
great presentation that a blog post

00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:09,820
about a presentation at a conference

00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:11,650
earlier this year on basically the same

00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,780
topic that this ended up being

00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:17,320
fortunately I had already submitted the

00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:20,080
abstract at this point the second one is

00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:22,150
a good blog series the third item is

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:26,290
actually a talk from uptime Kampf last

00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:28,930
August here in Pittsburgh which was it

00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:30,670
was really really good if you want to

00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:32,740
watch someone present better than I ever

00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:34,270
will in my life I encourage that

00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:37,150
presentation but that's where I learned

00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:40,300
about trust but verify we mentioned the

00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:43,270
successful Google teams we mentioned the

00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:44,920
slack engineering manager anatomy of a

00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:48,220
great pull request this is a member of

00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:50,020
the rails core team talking about his

00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:52,150
experience reviewing open-source pull

00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:55,990
requests and what makes them good and

00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:57,520
easy to review and then the last two are

00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:59,650
if you're interested in the concept of

00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:03,070
mindfulness which active pausing is a

00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:05,920
part of mindfulness Jon kabat-zinn is

00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:08,500
considered the foremost expert in the

00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,000
subject and Time magazine thought it was

00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:13,500
an important enough topic to do an

00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,730
entire issue on at the end of last year

00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:18,280
so thank you very much

00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:20,830
thanks for your time those really are my

00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:26,770
cat's we do take lots and lots of

00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:28,090
pictures of them the obligatory comment

00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:29,560
that I failed to mention at the

00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:31,270
beginning is I work for a company called

00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:34,080
pin drop all right now I can write off

00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:34,080
this entire talk

00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:41,460
so yeah thanks for your time

00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:41,460
