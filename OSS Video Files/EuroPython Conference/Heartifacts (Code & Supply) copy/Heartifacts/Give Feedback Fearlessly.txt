Title: Give Feedback Fearlessly
Publication date: 2018-05-03
Playlist: Heartifacts
Description: 
	Constructive feedback can be difficult to receive gracefully and even harder to give effectively. In this session, we'll discuss why peer-to-peer feedback is necessary for a healthy team dynamic, introduce techniques for sharing feedback with team members, and work through example scenarios.

Sara mentioned by the innovation and I'm

00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:10,139
really really excited to talk to you all

00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:14,190
and hopefully get you to a point where

00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:18,720
you can give feedback seriously so a

00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:20,070
little about me I can't make reveals

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,779
laughs there we go

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:27,260
I am primarily a JavaScript developer I

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:31,470
work for a company called Detroit labs

00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:35,399
literally it's great I love it you

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:37,890
should all visit I am also the one of

00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,530
the ego development chapter leaders in

00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:53,270
Detroit's and I just I really love dogs

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:56,879
I cannot tell you how excited I've got

00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:59,160
some questions that I want to kind of

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,550
guide us through the next 30 minutes or

00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,650
so I realize that I the thing between

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,040
you and lunch I will try to keep it

00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,040
moving

00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:15,840
so first I want us to ex question what

00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:21,000
is feedback when I say feedback what

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:25,759
what do you think of I heard criticism

00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,759
twice what

00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:45,390
so I think I give them a lot of things

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:48,000
to a lot of people to play why do we

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,030
need it why is that important all of

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,659
those things

00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:57,539
gross we have a blind spot what else

00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:00,570
course direction gentlemen and the

00:01:57,539 --> 00:02:03,619
target t-shirts it's how we learn I like

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:08,130
that what else

00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:10,709
perspective we got some perspectives and

00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:13,470
the last question and the lemon that

00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:18,959
kind of sparked this talk in the first

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:22,260
place for me is this why is it so scary

00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:29,549
why is it uncomfortable for us to give

00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:33,390
other people feedback so we in the fear

00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:33,630
of rejection there are power dynamics at

00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:38,250
play

00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:41,160
yes aberration you're going to feel some

00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:48,750
new admiration you elaborate a little

00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:50,600
bit there are so many people there you

00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:55,200
go

00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:58,380
so there's a lot a lot of these feelings

00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,959
tied up and it was very logical very

00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:06,720
practical thinking's that we just sent a

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:08,280
feedback it so this came out of a

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,019
conversation or not we had at Detroit

00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:16,290
Labs and can tell you she's not invested

00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:19,139
we so we are at a largely flat

00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:21,420
organization we don't have managers we

00:03:19,139 --> 00:03:24,900
are starting to experiment with like

00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:28,920
technical needs but largely we are all

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:29,549
responsible for each other and that's

00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,190
awesome

00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:34,380
most of the time like I really love it

00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,480
it's a place where I feel like I hadn't

00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:39,930
direct my own growth and that's amazing

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:43,090
however what also means that we each

00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:46,810
need to step up

00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:49,300
and talk to each other when things are

00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:53,590
going really great and also when things

00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:56,440
are maybe not going so limit and so the

00:03:53,590 --> 00:04:00,310
idea that we hold ourselves back that we

00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:03,400
struggle to give each other back gift of

00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,870
feedback was really hard for me if I'm

00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,690
one of those people I can't let things

00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,760
say if I have a problem I need you to

00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:12,250
know about it as soon as possible or

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,570
it's just going to eat me up inside I

00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:19,450
can't sleep and I need sleep

00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:22,180
so this is what I think of when I can

00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:24,669
give feedback I picture a behavior and

00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:27,970
not a person I think Sara said something

00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:30,310
along these lines it's not a person that

00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:32,080
I'm trying to change it's not a person

00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:35,970
that I'm trying to influence necessarily

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:39,490
it is the behavior that I'm observing I

00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:42,039
think that it's really important because

00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:44,350
none of us works in a bubble we are all

00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:47,410
interconnected I don't care if you are a

00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:51,340
one-person shop and you're freelancing

00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:53,410
in your kitchen like you are interacting

00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:59,440
with people and you need to be able to

00:04:53,410 --> 00:05:01,570
give those people feedback and lastly I

00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,919
hope this is what you take away from

00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:08,410
this session it doesn't have to be scary

00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:09,910
there are ways that we can approach a

00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:13,419
situation even a really uncomfortable

00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:17,380
one things that we can keep in mind so

00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:20,110
that we can come up with one actionable

00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:24,130
solutions until walk away with the

00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:26,169
relationship intact so as Sarah

00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:28,479
mentioned we're going to talk a little

00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:31,960
bit about how we might go about doing

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,490
that and then I am going to ask you to

00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,550
do an exercise I'm gonna ask me to

00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:42,220
participate talk to each other no that's

00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:44,500
why else but well once we get there

00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,070
we're gonna wrap up about five minutes

00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,530
and then

00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:52,930
I will release you all maybe unless

00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:56,800
there I'll be able to eat so let's get

00:05:52,930 --> 00:06:00,250
started so when I talk about feedback

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:02,770
remember the first two things I heard or

00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:06,280
criticism the first thing we think about

00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:08,470
when we talk about feedback is criticism

00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,620
something is wrong I've done something

00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:16,480
wrong I like to think about that as a

00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:19,480
constructive feedback the hope for me at

00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,610
least is that there is a purpose there

00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:26,260
is a reason that you are getting that

00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:31,240
feedback and hopefully that purpose is

00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:33,610
aligned with your team's goals I want to

00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:37,690
talk to you about this things that I

00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:41,290
noticed you that you do when you submit

00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:42,790
a PR and that's maybe keeping us from

00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,290
moving forward as quickly as we could

00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:47,560
let's let's talk about that let's see if

00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:50,020
we can find a solution on the other hand

00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:52,750
the part of this that I think we often

00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:56,980
forget is that there is also a formative

00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:58,270
feedback it is so important to tell your

00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:02,560
team members when you think they're

00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:06,310
doing really well if I am a new

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:10,660
developer on a team and this totally was

00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:12,790
not me three months ago not at all I'm

00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:15,700
the brand new developer on this massive

00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:18,760
progress and there are 15 other people

00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:23,100
who've been there for a year I am just

00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:29,020
drowning it no idea what I'm doing but

00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:31,570
in reality I know I'm gonna know that I

00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:34,300
want you to tell me because I have no

00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:35,650
frame of reference I don't know how I'm

00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:38,890
doing I'm doing everything that I can

00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:41,250
and I'm asking questions and I'm trying

00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:44,590
and getting your figure out but I

00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:48,280
am NOT going to know unless you give me

00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:50,020
your honest feedback it is so so

00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:52,600
important that we make sure that we are

00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:54,370
not only talking to each other when

00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,470
things are going wrong but also we're

00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:57,980
uplifting

00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:02,790
we noticed specific behaviors that are

00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:06,780
really helpful and productive the point

00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:09,660
here is that we mean both oh all mixed

00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:11,700
in together when it's appropriate to

00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:13,710
give affirmative feedback you're giving

00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:16,560
affirmative feedback when you really

00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,510
need to step in and give some

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,790
constructive feedback we're giving

00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:27,330
constructive feedback and none of this

00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:28,890
sandwich nonsense but whenever I was

00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:30,480
taught someone is always like oh well

00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:32,159
you know there's this thing where you

00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:34,530
can start with something really positive

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:40,740
and then you just slip in the hard thing

00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:42,419
and we want both of these types of

00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:44,640
feedback to kind of have their own space

00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:47,790
they're both equally important we don't

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,910
want to downplay either one they both

00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:58,290
have an impact on your team and the work

00:08:50,910 --> 00:09:01,320
that you're doing together so all this

00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:03,360
is again is say when I'm talking about

00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:06,120
feedback I'm talking about peer to peer

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,930
feedback that goes kind of for all of

00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:14,010
these points that I'm making if there is

00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:16,620
an instance where something happens you

00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,570
know there is an issue with bias or

00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,510
harassment that you need to escalate

00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,190
that's an entirely separate situation we

00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:25,290
are not talking about those instances

00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:27,690
what I'm hoping to cover

00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:30,570
Earnest the thing is that one directly

00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:34,170
affects me work and two could

00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:35,730
potentially escalate into these more

00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:38,750
serious situations but we want to try

00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:42,830
and nip them in the bud

00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:46,200
so this is a meat-and-potatoes

00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:49,490
some techniques for actually delivering

00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,510
feedback effectively

00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:56,550
this first thing we kind of touched on

00:09:51,510 --> 00:10:00,050
right want to be specific how many times

00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:04,230
has someone told you that you are great

00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:09,750
thank you or they did a good job or that

00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:11,580
that that PR was awesome anyone ever

00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:22,040
gotten anything like that or are you all

00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:22,040
just right there how does that feel okay

00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:33,720
not that great why what what's good

00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,580
about what I just did I don't know

00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,910
I can't reproduce that and go into

00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:44,760
feeling for you in three months because

00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:52,230
I just don't know and if you're me then

00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:54,930
I start to wonder like what on the other

00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:57,570
hand you said something like I really

00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:00,720
appreciate that you are so specific in

00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:03,000
your contributions to stand up every day

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,710
because I know exactly what you're doing

00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,030
I know where I can step in and help and

00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:10,170
then know when you're not gonna be

00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:13,170
available now I know exactly what I did

00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:16,200
that was helpful to you and I know why

00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:18,000
that was helpful to you and so I can

00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:23,000
iterate on that and I can say okay well

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:25,470
I can be Evan be more specific if the

00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,730
opportunity arises awesome and I know

00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:31,980
that's going to be helpful to that

00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:35,070
person we also want to deliver feedback

00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:38,970
proactively now this is where I measure

00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:40,830
that escalation in issue so how many

00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:43,440
times have you compress and at route

00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:47,769
work but was maybe just kind of annoying

00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:52,569
the first time or two and then it

00:11:47,769 --> 00:11:56,920
just that thing kept happening got more

00:11:52,569 --> 00:11:59,079
annoying and all of a sudden you find

00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,959
you bet you just can't even look at this

00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:07,410
person anymore as I've ever happened to

00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:10,749
you many yes most of the time

00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:14,399
most of the time and those sorts of

00:12:10,749 --> 00:12:15,610
things happen if we catch it the first

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,759
second

00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:21,429
maybe you've been the fifth time

00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:24,369
everything to go can be fine we can move

00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:27,699
on we can maintain a normal relationship

00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:30,699
without any sort of real struggle but

00:12:27,699 --> 00:12:33,459
when we you let it get that deep we let

00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:37,269
it fester for that long it becomes so

00:12:33,459 --> 00:12:39,339
much harder to have a reasonable

00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:42,040
rational conversation because you're so

00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:44,170
wrapped up and how angry and upset you

00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:47,949
are about this really awful thing that

00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:50,709
this terrible person is doing you don't

00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:54,249
want to let it get that far

00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:59,410
we want to try and address things as

00:12:54,249 --> 00:13:01,749
they come up flips like that let's take

00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:04,329
a breath every time I do this someone

00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:07,089
else really everyday has had a 5-bit

00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:07,959
justin breathe or take a breath so I'm

00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:11,309
gonna ask you again

00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:11,309
I thought us

00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:24,350
it's not that deep bacala portal we

00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:28,639
don't want to rush in when we are

00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:34,910
extremely well when we're only thinking

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:46,399
with is it section one there's a number

00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:52,910
one in some kind of brain Emily with

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:58,670
humor of the brain so we don't want to

00:13:52,910 --> 00:14:01,819
jump in too soon I just saw a slack

00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:04,699
message that was really really hurtful

00:14:01,819 --> 00:14:07,610
and I'm not reacting well I'm really

00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:10,610
angry that's not the time for me to give

00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:16,999
someone feedback what I will do instead

00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:21,860
is I'll say hey Nathan that didn't feel

00:14:16,999 --> 00:14:24,470
great interaction we just had and I I'm

00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:25,610
feeling really angry about it I don't

00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:29,300
want to talk about it right now because

00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:33,079
I I don't wanna say something that I'm

00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:33,769
gonna regret I don't want to overstate

00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:36,199
the issue either

00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:39,699
so can we subside sometime and talk

00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:39,699
about it maybe in a couple days

00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:49,649
and this is something that maybe is not

00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:51,120
quite so obvious you want to check your

00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:56,959
bias when you're going into these

00:14:51,120 --> 00:15:00,690
conversations you want to remember that

00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:02,970
your interpretation of the exact same

00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:07,110
events that this other person has

00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:10,740
experienced might not be the city you

00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:14,490
might see that conversation as this

00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:16,050
really hostile interaction and they

00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:23,160
might have thought that they were just

00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:27,420
being funny and recognizing that and

00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:29,579
being open to the other stories that

00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:33,079
this person is telling me I don't know

00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:36,149
if you've read additional conversations

00:15:33,079 --> 00:15:39,990
being being open and recognizing that

00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:43,380
those other stories exist is a good

00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:47,190
first step to being able to come to a

00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:49,350
reasonable resolution and sort of

00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:51,720
related to that is inviting discussion

00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:55,230
you don't want to make too many

00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:59,100
assumptions about the facts of the

00:15:55,230 --> 00:16:00,540
situation again your your own emotions

00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:03,620
your own stories are going to be feeding

00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:08,190
into your interpretation of those facts

00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:12,089
and you want to ask questions to try and

00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:14,550
mitigate some of that so that that

00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:17,940
person is drawn into the conversation

00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:22,160
then and you can come into you can come

00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:28,470
to a solution together and come forward

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:30,209
so stay with that for a second and we're

00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:33,720
going to talk through an example

00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:35,940
scenario once we've done this I'm going

00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:39,089
to ask you to look at the cards that you

00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:40,980
were given and I will explain in great

00:16:39,089 --> 00:16:43,550
detail what I would like you to do with

00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:50,760
those cards

00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:52,260
so let's chat about Michael Michael is

00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,820
actually a friend of mine who went

00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:56,640
through boot camp and was a junior

00:16:53,820 --> 00:17:00,660
developer that's where the story comes

00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:03,270
from so Michael is relatively new to the

00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:06,060
team still getting used to the processes

00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:08,400
and he is struggling to keep up with his

00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:10,440
more senior peers he's often taking

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,710
significantly longer to complete tasks

00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:16,620
that he is estimated sometimes that

00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:19,050
involves code style issues that code

00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:21,839
then requires discussion on how to fix

00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:25,410
it and additional development time to

00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:27,750
satisfy your success criteria so how do

00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:39,870
we approach the conversation with

00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:44,060
Michael what's going on there yeah it

00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:44,060
sounds pretty normal how do we think

00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:58,380
yeah exactly

00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,800
you all are much faster at this than

00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,800
anyone

00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:29,650
but you could also explain that you

00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:34,730
would like him to work on giving more

00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:38,600
exact estimates or in if you could work

00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:44,540
on estimating then the team can plan for

00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:45,980
it really and it's not that it's not

00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,620
that it's not okay to take that time

00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:51,850
they just want to know what time and

00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,850
I'll shake one more okay

00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:57,950
I would also invite him to talk more

00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,230
about his experience and how he feels

00:18:57,950 --> 00:19:01,820
about the situation's of it I'm not

00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:09,230
making assumptions that he's feeling

00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:11,240
that way awesome so you oh of course

00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:25,880
we're on a conference but with a little

00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:29,390
feeling so you guys nailed it so there's

00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,670
a lot of stuff going on here one well

00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:37,990
had that experience we were nobody in

00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:43,670
this room was born right in libraries

00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:45,470
nobody nobody just magically came upon

00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:49,130
this knowledge that they have now

00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:53,690
they're all juniors all started

00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:54,740
somewhere and so there is some level of

00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:58,880
and the thing that we can hopefully

00:19:54,740 --> 00:20:01,670
achieve miracle there are couple things

00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,400
here so Michael very well might be

00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:06,050
feeling like he is underperforming he

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,720
might be stressed about that that may be

00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:11,030
playing into some of the mistakes that

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:15,230
he's making in his code we don't know

00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:19,900
and so simplest thing to do is asked

00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:21,880
Michael how he's feeling how he thinks

00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:28,110
has first couple months on the job or

00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:28,110
going just start that dialogue with him

00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:34,840
and I think to one thing we didn't get

00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:39,130
to you which you all probably with

00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:44,980
heaven another five seven is we want to

00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:47,350
look at our process to why why does this

00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:49,810
been going on I didn't tell you how long

00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:53,070
it's been going on could have been a

00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:55,360
week could have been three months but

00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:59,230
something that something's happening we

00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:01,720
can we can see that something is going

00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:04,090
on and there really needs to be a

00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,820
conversation but where could we have

00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:09,160
supported Michael better could we have

00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:12,310
assigned him a buddy when he joined the

00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:15,640
team could we have made sure that he

00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:17,620
paired with all of the other developers

00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:21,370
to coming in a sentence for the act then

00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:26,190
the team and how everybody works could

00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:30,000
we have had a lunch and learn about

00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:31,870
estimation then how it's really hard

00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:36,370
there are a lot of things that we could

00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:38,740
do on our end as well to have rectify

00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:42,460
the situation and also to make sure that

00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:46,390
in the future this sort of struggle of

00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:48,900
this sort of main point is hopefully not

00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,900
as common

00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:07,730
you all have a chance to hopefully at

00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:11,450
least mostly work through your scenarios

00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:13,909
I thought would look like they were done

00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:20,779
in a couple other sources but I would

00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:24,110
think to use that's okay I know some of

00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:26,240
you notice the the eventual releases the

00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:27,889
bullet points but these are things to

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,730
keep in mind when you're having these

00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:35,929
some of these conversations now in this

00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:38,360
situation it's manufactured I told you

00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:40,490
who you were and I've gave you very few

00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:45,379
details so you don't know some of these

00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:48,769
things but you can imagine how some of

00:22:45,379 --> 00:22:51,559
these things might affect the tone or

00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:54,259
even the holes in the conversation how

00:22:51,559 --> 00:23:00,309
is it different if you're talking to

00:22:54,259 --> 00:23:04,210
your manager or the CEO versus you're

00:23:00,309 --> 00:23:04,210
going to say for me

00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:18,179
first it is you know a person next to

00:23:10,269 --> 00:23:21,100
you does other conversation change if

00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:24,869
your communication status are just

00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:26,470
really different does that lead to more

00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:32,019
misunderstandings does that lead to more

00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:35,679
conflict in my experience probably what

00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:37,659
happens if you become angry what happens

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:42,220
if the other person becomes angry

00:23:37,659 --> 00:23:44,409
how would you deescalate that that is Oh

00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:48,999
far more than I could pack it into 30

00:23:44,409 --> 00:23:51,039
minutes but come back and see me for

00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:56,049
round 2 at some point in the near future

00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:57,700
so I want to make sure that we are at

00:23:56,049 --> 00:24:05,190
least thinking about these things that

00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:10,179
they're on our radar and one last thing

00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:12,940
I would like to hear just two of the

00:24:10,179 --> 00:24:17,230
action items that people came away with

00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:19,299
does anyone have one here one of the

00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:21,190
things I liked about what he did was he

00:24:19,299 --> 00:24:23,739
said this is something I have noticed

00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:26,289
and then asked me for how my experience

00:24:23,739 --> 00:24:32,049
matched address was just saying this is

00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:34,029
going on let's deal with it why not

00:24:32,049 --> 00:24:36,070
what's one of the things I'm like that

00:24:34,029 --> 00:24:38,919
when did during our scenarios that she

00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:41,200
asked me what can I do to help you and

00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:42,789
she made it so that that it was safe and

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,889
comfortable for me as the employee

00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:46,960
situation to do that because often time

00:24:44,889 --> 00:24:48,580
today employee might not feel empowered

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,399
to be able to speak up and do that so

00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:53,730
know that it's okay to ask of that or

00:24:51,399 --> 00:24:53,730
someone

00:24:53,890 --> 00:25:00,200
well thank you all so so much for

00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:03,860
sticking with me and if you can't see

00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:06,650
that anyway I really appreciate you

00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:10,640
coming into these conversations and

00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:13,040
committing to actually participating in

00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:18,920
a presentation right before you get to

00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:20,870
go eat I truly I feel that here if you

00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:23,390
wouldn't mind just you can leave your

00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:24,830
cards on your chair you can come up and

00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:28,700
leave them on the table whatever you

00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:29,700
prefer I'll find them but thank you so

00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:33,789
much

00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,789
