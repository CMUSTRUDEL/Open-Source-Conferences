------
Goal of the conversation for Heartifacts 2020: People would have entry-level knowledge about the brain and basic cognitive processes which directly impact the work they do (and how they process information) on a routine basis so they might be able to “hack” their own brain.

Why does it matter?

Before the tech, is always the human. We bring ourselves to whatever it is we do.

1. Managing ourselves results in better output. We manage so many aspects of our lives, but many people don’t consider the role of their brains as it relates to what it is they do.If I know better, I can do better. Focus on skill acquisition as it pertains to your body and your brain. Awareness is where it begins.

1. Cognitive Control - frontal lobe in attention, concentration, problem solving and decision making. Insight and awareness too.

2. Emotional Control - limbic system/mammalian brain

3. Relational Control - Empathy, respect and compassion and boundaries.

What’s the science behind it?

1. The frontal lobe — Role of executive function in decision making, prospective planning. All of these things require energy and consideration around the allocation of resources. Bottom up/top down processing.

2. Limbic system and the mammalian brain - The emotional center of the brain. My emotions impact my decision making, attention, memory and resiliency. “Name it, to tame it.” The better we are at naming what we feel, the better we are at navigating ourselves and our relationships. Left/right hemispheric integration, the amygdala and the hippocampus.

3. Relationships - How can I manage myself and others better?

1. Mirror neurons and empathy…and respect too.

2. Compassion and boundaries - leading with understanding while setting parameters/clear expectations for performance and feedback.

What’s the practical application? So what, now what?

Where do I begin? Ask yourself, where am I having trouble or what area of my work do I want to improve?

Ask for feedback from your top 3. We all benefit from having a “board of advisors.” Who in your life do you permit to tell you about who you are and what you can do and where you struggle?

1. How are you performing in your job? Are you able to focus/concentrate/attend to the things you want to or are there distractions that continue to interfere with your performance? When do you tire and have trouble “keeping up” in the way you desire?

1. Then do this—examine your self-expectations and how you allocate energy. What things in your life (work, home, relationships, etc.) demand the most of you? Are there feelings or stressors in life that may be contributing to or interfering with your performance?

2. The value of emotions and the WHY behind what we do.

Ask yourself if it’s worth it? Is whatever job your doing/task you’re assigned to, workplace you’re in, is it valuable enough for to you to embrace the obstacles that you encounter on a regular basis? This gets at emotional seat of what you’re doing. Emotions always count—they’re just data. Data that needs to be considered and not omitted. How we respond to this data is important.

Strategies for improved emotional control: Mindfulness, gratitude, exercise (movement as a bartering of emotional energy), and more.

3. We never lose when we start with curiosity.

Can you practice being curious about others when you don’t understand them and why they do or say what they do? If I’m not willing to look beneath the surface, I’ll end up being distracted by the behavior I find ……….fill the blank (aversive, upsetting, irritating, annoying, etc.). Perspective taking and empathy. → Not “my perspective” of someone’s experience or challenges, but THEIR perspective. I have to be willing to move to the other side of the table when I “look” at what they’re doing.

Per Kristin Neff at the University of Texas, leading researcher on compassion, how might I practice being compassionate when I want to be demanding or hold others to the expectation of output? The interplay between my response to myself and flipping the lens to that of the other? How can involve them in the process of choice and decision-making, so that they feel and believe that their actions impact their situation and that of the team.

**When I level up, and manage myself effectively, I increase the likelihood of others following suit and leveling up themselves. We lead by example.

uh first up we have dr marielle reese to

00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,000
kick off our saturday

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
she's a licensed clinical psychologist

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,440
who has spent the past 11 years working

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,400
in private practice in the pacific

00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,000
northwest

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,320
prior to that she spent nearly three

00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,639
years working in clinical

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,560
neuropsychology

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,480
she's a co-founder of changelog in the

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,720
host of podcast brain science which

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,240
focuses on having conversations around

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,640
not just simply what we know about the

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,320
brain but how we can apply it

00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,920
how we can apply what we know to the

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,519
brain to improve our lives

00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,960
marielle's about to give us a great talk

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,120
to start us off for the day

00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,730
being human managing ourselves and our

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:41,360
output

00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:44,800
[Music]

00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,640
hello hello and welcome i am so excited

00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,680
to be here with all of you today

00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,680
especially in this alternative format

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,440
i just welcome the opportunity to

00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,480
interface with others

00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,320
in a sort of new way of doing things

00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,320
and so let me take a quick second and

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,719
introduce myself to all of you

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,400
my name is dr marielle reese and by

00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,920
trade and training i am a clinical

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,240
psychologist

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,159
i have spent over the last 11 years

00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,680
working in private practice here in the

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,080
pacific northwest

00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,360
and prior to that i spent nearly three

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,439
years working in clinical

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,880
neuropsychology wherein we primarily

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,040
worked with individuals

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,240
who sustained brain injuries or were

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,280
struggling to navigate

00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,680
developmental disabilities and so

00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:31,680
it was through that experience in

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,720
neuropsychology that really cultivated

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,799
my love for the brain and understanding

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,759
some of the physiological underpinnings

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,000
behind

00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:41,600
the choices we make and the behaviors

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,799
that we all do

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,600
and so it was

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,079
through a relationship with adam

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,280
stokovic that we also

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,079
founded the podcast brain science just

00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,280
over a year ago

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:59,759
which focuses on these conversations

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,560
around the brain and the body and

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,040
especially

00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,640
mental health and so we have

00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,960
conversations

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,119
talking about not just what we know

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,959
about the brain but how what we know

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:15,599
about the brain changes our lives and so

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,280
thank you to artifacts and everybody who

00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,120
has contributed to make this event what

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,720
it is today

00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,879
and this week because you guys can also

00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,840
see the need for having conversations

00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:28,400
around learning how to manage our mental

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,599
health

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,959
just as much as we do physical health

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,400
so thank you to all of you and i want to

00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,400
give you one little nugget

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,680
sort of that we repeat often over on

00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,560
brain science

00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,519
and that is name it to tame it and what

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,200
i mean by that

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:50,319
is we know from research that when

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,879
we have a vocabulary relative to what's

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,599
going on

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,080
internally that we're better able to

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,440
tame

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,519
or sort of manage the feelings we have

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,159
and ultimately that's my hope for you

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,239
today that we build a little bit more of

00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,560
a repertoire of vocabulary

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,519
around what's going on in your brain and

00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,840
body

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,720
so that you can learn how to human

00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,680
better

00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,480
because before the tech is always the

00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,000
human

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,000
there are a couple of things that are

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,920
really important for you guys to hold on

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,440
to amidst our conversation today

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,840
when it comes to neuroscience and

00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,720
neuropsychology the research is ever

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,760
evolving

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,799
what i mean is that when we're trying to

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,280
put together

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,000
this sort of puzzle about the brain and

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,159
the body and how

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,760
things work together we don't really

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,760
know what the ultimate picture

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,879
looks like and so if you've ever put

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,519
together a puzzle

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,720
with overlapping or seemingly similar

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,879
colors

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,400
you might have put a piece in that

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,680
puzzle thinking that that's where it

00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,159
belongs

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,360
only later to discover the correct piece

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:54,640
that goes there

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,640
and move that old piece and so

00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,120
when i talk today there are sort of

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,599
little nuggets relative to

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,400
what we know about the brain today but

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,439
bear in mind

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:08,640
those are ever changing with that said

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:12,000
the other thing i want you to hold on to

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,200
is this concept of neuroplasticity

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,920
so i wouldn't be having this

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,400
conversation today if i didn't really

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,280
have

00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,880
so much hope for people in changing how

00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,680
they feel and how they navigate their

00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,360
lives

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,199
and what's at the root of that is

00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,600
actually brain change

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,560
what i mean is that our brains are

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,720
designed

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,280
to adapt and this is a concept called

00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,320
neuroplasticity

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,880
wherein brains our bodies

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,840
are made up of chemical and electrical

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,000
processes

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,360
all right and neurons which is sort of

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,560
the most fundamental

00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,360
thing relative to our thoughts neurons

00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,160
operate by the all or none law and just

00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,800
like that sort of

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,479
wonky carnival game wherein you take a

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,440
hammer and hit the platform

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,080
and this little trinket goes flies up

00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,840
the pole

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,639
and it either hits the bell or it

00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,199
doesn't that's how neurons operate

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,199
and so they have to get to what we call

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,440
the threshold of excitation

00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,360
they have to get big enough or powerful

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,639
enough in order for

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:15,440
a neural network to run so it's sort of

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,520
like

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,680
this is the way to grandma's house we go

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,639
we learn how to sort of do our lives and

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,360
operate

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,639
as based on what we've practiced before

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,479
and so

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,919
when we manage ourselves more

00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,360
effectively we're

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:33,680
actually better able to output

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,280
more of what we want and that's i think

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,880
why we're all here today

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,639
is that you want to understand more of

00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:41,120
what's going on internally

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,479
in order to be able to produce perform

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,199
and cultivate

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,880
more of what it is in your life i'm

00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,280
going to talk about this relative to

00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,160
three

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,680
aspects of our brains and that involves

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,960
cognitive control

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,240
or managing cognitions that involves

00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,720
emotional control

00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,759
and relational control when i'm talking

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,759
about

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,600
cognition and sort of cognitive

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,720
processes i think it's helpful to

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,960
understand

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,800
what i'm talking about in the brain and

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,840
so i'm going to be talking not only

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,319
about structures

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,440
but functions and so luckily i brought

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,600
my brain today

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,360
nope not this one but this one right

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,800
here and so if you'll join me and put

00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,000
your hand up sort of like you're being

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,080
sworn in

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,319
all right then what i want you to do is

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,720
take your thumb and fold it across

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,160
the forefront of your palm and then fold

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,319
your four fingers

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,600
over the top and now you have your brain

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,520
too

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,000
so what i'm referencing in terms of

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,000
structure is we have our brain stem

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,840
which is sort of here at our wrist

00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
inside we have what we call our limbic

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,759
system which the two key structures

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,120
while there's more the two i'm going to

00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,919
talk about today

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,680
are our amygdala and hippocampus and

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:51,599
then when you fold your fingers over

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,280
this is your frontal lobe which is

00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,360
seated right behind

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,039
your skull and your forehead here all

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,360
right and why that's important

00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,479
is because the way in which we process

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,199
information

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,680
is multifaceted we process it from the

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,680
bottom

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,520
up like through the brainstem up through

00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:09,360
the limbic system and up to the

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,720
neocortex which the frontal lobe is a

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,680
part of

00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,160
and then back down so sort of what we

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,560
know

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,400
other information we have previous

00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,120
experiences etc

00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,000
so that's top down and then outside in

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,880
what's going on

00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,039
outside of us and how we sort of put

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,039
that puzzle together on the inside

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,240
so in cognitive control i really want to

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,680
focus on the con

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,599
the parts of the brain in the frontal

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,000
lobe and so our frontal lobe

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,599
does a lot of things one of the ways in

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,080
which researchers talk about it is what

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,680
they call

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,199
executive function and what that

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,199
function of our brain does is a lot of

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,280
what you guys are doing in

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,199
technology and really any sort of higher

00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,080
order job in that attention

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,759
is a component of it um speed of

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,800
information processing like

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,199
how quickly can i make sense of the data

00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,800
set shifting switching from one task to

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,199
another task to another thing to

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,160
answering a phone to being interrupted

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,160
as well as judgment and decision making

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,199
i mean this is a major workhorse of our

00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,840
brain

00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,440
and so bear in mind none of sort of what

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,759
our brain does is ever just

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,639
one part there's always different parts

00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,240
at play

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,479
the reason why managing ourselves from a

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,720
cognitive perspective is so important

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,599
is because it's really around managing

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,080
energy

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:32,719
and attention and researchers have said

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,680
attention is a very competitive

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,919
environment

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,880
so what you are doing all day long is

00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,440
trying to sort of

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,000
jock you around allocating energy

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,360
managing

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,240
attention making decisions and

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,040
it can be just like lifting weights in

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,279
the gym

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,200
there's a significant cognitive load and

00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,680
that's why this is so important

00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,880
because if you don't manage what's going

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,519
on in your brain

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,959
it's simply harder to do basically

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,519
everything that you do

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,560
there was research out of the university

00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,399
of oregon's

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,000
social and affective lab and if you're

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,839
not familiar with the term

00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,320
affective it's really just regarding

00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,680
emotion so we say affect or emotion

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,399
and so moving that what they looked at

00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,800
was sort of

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,720
willpower and sort of what's going on

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,640
and why does it make it hard

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,160
for us to sometimes do the things we

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,680
want to do

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,080
much of the time researchers have sort

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,959
of looked at willpower and then said you

00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,959
just have to sort of will it to want it

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,399
but it isn't that simple is what these

00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,800
researchers found

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,440
and that they identify that there's a

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,399
will

00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,480
relative to what we are trying to do and

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,800
a way that we go about it

00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,600
and i think many of us sort of get stuck

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,720
in this

00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:49,600
sort of you push harder you focus more

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,680
you sleep less and yet all of those

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,560
things are actually going to take away

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,959
from your ability to do it and this is

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,560
why

00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,800
the problem solving makes such a

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,800
difference because

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,320
you can look at alternative ways to do

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,519
things and then go

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,320
oh that didn't take so much energy now i

00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,120
have

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,480
energy to put over here so much of

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,279
managing our brain

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,800
has to do with managing resources and

00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,519
just like we learn how to manage our

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,279
money

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,959
and we all have different preferences

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,880
and proclivities with what we

00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,959
want to spend that on and what feels

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,360
good so it is with our brain

00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,440
and so i can't talk about cognitive

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,760
without talking about the emotional

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,560
the emotional is so significant because

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,920
it can sort of

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,200
run interference with our ability to

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,279
process data

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,200
i've seen this a lot actually in working

00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,000
or in evaluating people with

00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,640
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder

00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,160
which i'm

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,880
so excited to hear that other

00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,800
conversation at the conference this week

00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,800
but part of what's going on especially

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,760
with adults who were not diagnosed in

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,800
childhood

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,760
is i'm always looking to sort of examine

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,519
if there is some other disorder

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,200
diagnosis that's running interference

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,240
and what i mean by that is

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:06,480
are there other sort of emotions

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,320
that actually are contributing to the

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,560
difficulty with attention

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,640
or is it truly a neurobiological

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,640
disorder as is the case in attention

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,959
deficit hyperactivity disorder

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,480
much of the time we can be overwhelmed

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,440
and so it's sort of like going up that

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,760
whole system

00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,480
right if we're taking in information and

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,760
i'm super

00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:27,279
anxious i can't process data in the same

00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,680
sort of way

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,720
and in working with people many of them

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,200
have said i never

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,560
thought about the way in which anxiety

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,760
could sort of

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,360
hiccup or interrupt the way in which i'm

00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,079
processing and so they're surprised like

00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,240
maybe they don't have adhd

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,120
but it's actually more this anxiety or

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,320
depression

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:51,040
like i can't concentrate i can't focus

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,440
might be more relative to that than it

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,040
is

00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,720
actually a different way in which your

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,200
brain is designed

00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,120
and so we have to learn sort of

00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,399
emotional coping strategies

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:06,160
skills and awareness and with

00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:09,279
that i always say feelings aren't facts

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,600
but they are feedback and

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,560
much of what happens is throughout our

00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,000
lives

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,959
we have experiences and

00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
we have feelings about those experiences

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,160
and like i mentioned

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,240
earlier about the different structures

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,440
involved in emotional control

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,600
the hippocampus and amygdala those are

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,200
two key things that help sort of

00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,839
assimilate data

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,760
and then bank it for future references

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,320
one of the things i often talk about

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,079
with

00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,399
sort of how we can help our brains do

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,320
better is we remember better when we

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,720
make information meaningful

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,160
and so my apologies to anyone with the

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,639
name amy today

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,519
but when i talk about the limbic system

00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,440
i reference the amygdala as crazy amy

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,680
and the hippocampus if you just think of

00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,399
a big hippo because i think of the way

00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:59,360
in which we

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,000
bank emery memories what we know about

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,240
the brain

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,920
and relative to emotion is that the

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,639
bigger the emotional valence and it

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,839
doesn't matter

00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,920
positive or negative the more likely we

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,639
are to bank that information

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:14,480
and so what we can do is actually sort

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,639
of condition ourself

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,920
to anticipate a certain feeling or

00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,959
experience

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,839
as based upon the past which may

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,440
very well be how you felt at that moment

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,440
but it doesn't mean

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,360
it's true when we talk about research

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,720
in the field we always sort of talk

00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,560
about it relative to a couple of

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,920
different terms and that is validity and

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,160
reliability

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,279
and what i mean by validity is sort of

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,880
it's true like

00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,720
yes that happened like i went to the

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,120
grocery store the other day or

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,399
i went out swimming but when i'm talking

00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,199
about reliability

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,800
i'm meaning over and over again that if

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,720
multiple people researched

00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,560
according to the same way i did that

00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,040
they would cultivate the same results

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,480
and that's sort of what it is with

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,720
emotional control

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,959
that we have to sort of be able to label

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,000
things and know what's going on

00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:08,160
emotionally in order to be able to

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,920
navigate them differently and so i talk

00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,800
a lot about the value

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,040
in therapy of differentiating sort of

00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,160
like i put things like i understand i

00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,160
feel this way

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,920
in my work environment or in this

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,480
relationship with someone

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,079
as a result of past experiences i've had

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,760
and the way in which i labeled it

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,240
and so the hope with that and the

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:31,120
amazing thing is that again

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,760
we can build alternative vocabulary that

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,680
helps us

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,519
even sort of differentiate things

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,639
further and further and make things more

00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,199
succinct

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,959
so that they don't run interference with

00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,920
our work in the way in which

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,959
we want to actually produce shifting

00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,519
gears

00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,880
i can't help but talk about

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,839
relationships

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,720
because so much of managing our

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,120
relationships

00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,839
has to do with managing our brain and

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,079
managing

00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,360
our emotions and working with couples

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,600
and families

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,720
couples in particular i often say the

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,760
hardest thing

00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,839
is to learn how to manage yourself and

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,519
advocate for yourself at the time you're

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:13,279
hearing feedback from the other

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:16,079
person so you have to be sort of open

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:17,120
and yet advocating for yourself at the

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,440
same time

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,160
at the heart of relationship kind of

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:26,000
like that validity and reliability thing

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:28,000
is validity as it relates to empathy

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,360
if you want to be able to work well with

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,320
other people

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,440
we have to learn how to empathize

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,000
empathy

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,360
was discovered relative to mirror

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
neurons and these have sort of been a

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,639
hotbed

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,199
of neuroscience for some time now as

00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,880
reachers

00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,720
researchers try to understand what's

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,639
going on but the

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,160
location or research study in which they

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,959
were developed was actually

00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,360
in the case of monkeys and what they

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,120
found

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:58,000
out was that monkeys ran the same neural

00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,320
networks i.e the same play

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,199
was shown on the screen sort of when

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,600
they were measuring

00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,600
how the brain worked whether a monkey

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,720
was actually eating a banana

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,279
or watching another monkey do that and

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,320
so

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:14,560
i find it super fascinating that

00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,680
when it comes to empathy our motor

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,880
neuron system

00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:21,920
is actually involved in that so

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,480
empathy involves this sort of movement

00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:27,759
not only do can i sort of identify with

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,000
where somebody is at emotionally but it

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,560
also spurs me to move

00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,600
a sort of analogy i give relative to

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,920
this with patients

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,519
is when i'm sitting across from someone

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,560
i'm not necessarily going to see their

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,800
vantage point

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,240
however if i get up and i move and i sit

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,199
beside them

00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,959
at some point what we see in our line of

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,360
sight has to converge

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,160
and that's at the heart of empathy so

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,320
look

00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,639
all of us have different experiences and

00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,560
even if you have a sibling

00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,800
you might talk through childhood

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,959
experiences and memories that you have

00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,720
and they are not the same thing but

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,959
that's because we're all different

00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,720
and so it's not my job to tell someone

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,199
that their struggle isn't real

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,079
that how they feel doesn't count because

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,120
how we feel

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,959
is always valid but we have to be able

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,919
to learn how to manage that and modulate

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,839
that

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,679
as it relates to our relationships with

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,559
others as well

00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,480
so i can't talk about empathy without

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,439
talking about compassion

00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,880
and compassion is this sense of like

00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,880
gosh that is hard

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,720
and is there any other way that i can

00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,360
help you again

00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,720
movement is involved in that and so i

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,000
want to be very clear

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:43,200
when i talk about compassion i do not

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,400
mean permission compassion does involve

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,960
boundaries

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,039
and so in the same way if i had a

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,880
patient in my office come in who was

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:53,120
really distraught and upset

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,960
and they started throwing my pillows on

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:56,320
my sofas all around or jumping on my

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,480
desk or my sofas

00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,480
i would have a very clear conversation

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,960
relative to the expectations

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,600
and what the consequences might be like

00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,039
hey

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,720
i understand that this is super

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,320
challenging this is just not the way in

00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,880
which we navigate that

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,160
here are some other options that we can

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,400
do and talk through

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,080
however if you can't if we can't work

00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,280
within that framework

00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:22,400
i'm going to have to you know let you go

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:25,280
because it involves the sense of respect

00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,200
and so boundaries and respect are a part

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,200
of that compassion and empathy when it

00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,720
comes to relationships

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,360
sometimes when we feel like our feelings

00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,360
are so

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,520
so so important and we're not being

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,880
heard those can be the hardest and most

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,360
challenging times

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,160
to be able to get up and move and see

00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:44,480
something for

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,160
a from another person's perspective but

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,640
just because we can't do it at that

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,080
moment

00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,160
live doesn't mean we can't do it it just

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,360
might mean we need to develop some other

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,919
skills or strategies or ways of managing

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,679
our brains our bodies so that we can

00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,200
manage our relationships better

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,200
so with that you might be saying well

00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,039
marielle this is all fine and dandy but

00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,720
like to some degree so what

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:11,200
now what what can i do to change or

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,320
manage myself better i would say i'm so

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,720
glad you asked

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,919
when we're trying to change the place we

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:18,720
always start

00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,640
is asking questions and with asking

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,200
questions the reason i do that

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,039
is so that i can develop more awareness

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,280
around what's going on and what could be

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,799
contributing to where i'm getting stuck

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,960
or why i'm having trouble

00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,640
awareness is interesting because you

00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,600
might think that

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,720
you know it's just sort of hardwired

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,720
into us

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,160
but interestingly enough insight is

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,440
actually another one of those frontal

00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,679
lobe functions

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,039
and so while i would love to say our

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,200
perspective

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:49,360
is amazing and we don't need any other

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,520
input or feedback from others

00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,039
i'm gonna have to disappoint you when i

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,960
worked in brain injury

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,320
one of the strategies that we practiced

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,160
so often with clients

00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:01,120
was cultivating what we call the board

00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:03,280
of advisors and it's interesting because

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,440
i think so many things i learned through

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,640
that experience still apply to anybody

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,960
without an injury

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,320
because they're still helpful what i

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,559
mean by our three to five

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,520
board of advisors are who are the people

00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,440
who can sort of

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,880
help us with ourselves bear in mind you

00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,840
pick these people they don't

00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,000
self-appoint

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,919
that's not how boards work right but

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,120
these are people who really we can have

00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,760
conversations with

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,600
they can help us be more aware and

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,600
considerate of ourselves

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,039
and sort of where we're having

00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,039
difficulty or

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,600
getting stuck whether it be at work in

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:38,960
relationships relationships at work

00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:41,840
or even maybe with them right

00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,679
what i want to start with is what i call

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,960
being your own scientist

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,320
and that involves exploring you

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,320
don't always know what you're going to

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,159
find when you go researching but it

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,159
doesn't stop you from doing so

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,520
where do you get stuck are you having

00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,320
trouble if we're going to start with

00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,559
this sort of

00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,000
cognitive aspect we want to look at

00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:02,000
ourselves from a basic

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,919
physiological perspective and i think

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,760
you guys all know the sort of

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,080
basics that are important when it comes

00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,200
to managing our physical body right

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,840
like food sleep

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,200
exercise right and really a lot of that

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,360
has to do with managing

00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,679
energy because if i don't get enough

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,480
sleep i'm probably going to struggle

00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,360
with my energy i might you know borrow

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,760
some from

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,280
some from caffeine but that's going to

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,520
dissipate at some point

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,640
so i want to make sure research shows

00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,400
eight hours of sleep

00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,240
makes the biggest difference seven hours

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,200
can cut it but eight hours you're

00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,120
further ahead

00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:41,679
i know that many people aren't a super

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,640
big fan of exercise but what if i told

00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,520
you

00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,960
that exercise might actually help you be

00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:50,000
a little bit

00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:53,200
what do i say nerdier like

00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,280
brainier because what exercise

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,679
actually helps us do is improve that

00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,320
neural neuroplasticity

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,240
so our brain can change all the more

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,559
there's been so much fascinating

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,640
research relative to this and there's

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,760
focusing on this little thing we call

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,880
bdnf

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:13,520
or brain-derived neurotrophic factor

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,799
and what that has done is really shown

00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,080
the way in which

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:20,080
exercise helps change our brain not just

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,080
today but for the future so it really

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:25,280
sets you on a different trajectory

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,440
and with that you can have

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,039
more ability to see things from

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,520
different perspectives

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,159
because your brain is more flexible dare

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:35,280
i say

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:38,400
exercise also helps

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,400
us to navigate our emotions so much of

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,320
talking about emotions is really

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,960
relative to managing energy

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,919
along with that and it's interesting

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,400
because

00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,039
um oftentimes i find that people have

00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,159
feelings

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:54,000
about feelings right like

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,440
i can have a feeling and not want to

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,480
have the feeling that i'm actually

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,919
feeling

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,280
which can be problematic and so exercise

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,360
is going to help us

00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,760
modulate and manage those feelings too

00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:08,640
almost like a bartering system

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,919
this sort of discharges and sort of

00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,520
moves the energy

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,280
so that it doesn't just sort of stay

00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,400
confined inside of us

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,640
but rather we exchange it in other ways

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,440
with the world outside of us whether i'm

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,840
in a gym

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,880
walking outside playing tennis

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,280
basketball

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,080
you name it swimming any and all of

00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,840
these things

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,600
really help us to manage both the

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,679
cognitive and the emotional

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,760
aspects of ourselves i don't know if

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,000
you've thought about this much but

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,799
the role of expectations we have for

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,440
ourself

00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:41,120
also plays a significant role in how we

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,279
feel and how we manage

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,720
ourselves and our especially our work

00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:47,039
because we can sort of

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,880
be critical or upset with ourselves

00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,360
because we don't feel like we measured

00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,919
up

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,880
to our expectations and when that

00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:55,200
happens

00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,520
there tend to be a few feelings about

00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,120
that so i want you to be aware of what

00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,120
you expect of yourself

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,720
could you even answer that if i asked

00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,360
you today how

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,200
are you expecting yourself to perform is

00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,440
there any standard for that

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,520
does it have to look the same day after

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,559
day i might ask you how do you respond

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,440
when you get stuck

00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,960
working on a project at work any and all

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,480
of these questions like

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:23,039
begin that process of discovery

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,760
and look when you know more of yourself

00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,400
and sort of

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,360
what's going on internally and then know

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,840
what you can do

00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,279
to modulate it differently it can make a

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,440
world of difference

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,919
another key thing because i'm trying to

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,960
barter allocate this energy

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:41,600
is what we would call what

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,960
what is journaling i know i might get

00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,559
eye rolls on that too

00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,799
but just like i talked about the name it

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,799
to tame it the reason that is so

00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:51,279
valuable is because i put that

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,520
emotion i put what was going on into

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:56,320
words like i put it in a container

00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,039
and i filed it somewhere and so the

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,480
journaling

00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,200
helps me sort of put that aside and then

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,120
move on

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,200
i often recommend this for people who

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,799
have trouble sort of with sleep

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,720
that if you're having these sort of

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,799
recurrent thoughts

00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,799
that keep popping up that you just sort

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,279
of when you're awake

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,000
unwanted of course that you write those

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,000
things down

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,120
close it and as the thoughts come back

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,960
up that you

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,400
tell yourself yep i know where to find

00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,360
those i wrote them down and i can look

00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,440
at them in the morning

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,200
after i've slept so see how much

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,279
interplay there is even between

00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,640
our physical bodies and just sort of

00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:33,279
managing the fundamentals

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,640
as well as our emotions there's a couple

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,760
of other key things

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,840
and one is the practice of gratitude

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,440
which what researchers have found is

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,240
it's not just sort of being

00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,200
thankful but actually expressing

00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,840
gratitude

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,200
to a person or writing it down on a more

00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:51,440
routine basis

00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,120
i've heard it said you know that it's

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,679
not happy people

00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,279
who are thankful but rather thankful

00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,679
people who are happy

00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,799
our brains tend to feed whatever it is

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:04,240
we focus on

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,200
and if i practice gratitude guess what

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,240
i'm focusing on

00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,080
more often than not i'm focusing on the

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,559
good on the things that i'm thankful

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,200
for which sort of prompts my brain to

00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,640
see more

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,960
and more of the good things and the

00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,919
opportunities that i want to see

00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,520
apart from that one of the other really

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,880
helpful things if you're not familiar

00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,039
with mindfulness

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,880
it really is just orienting yourself

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:30,480
around the here and now

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:32,559
and so that could look like

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:35,039
i'm sitting here having a conversation

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:38,159
with you via video

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,720
right it could be you know orienting

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,440
yourself

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,120
around what's actually happening and not

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,480
what you imagined to be happening in the

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,279
future or what's happened

00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,039
in the past when we're really upset

00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,880
sometimes it's really even helpful to

00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:53,120
orient to the senses

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,159
because senses are all real time they're

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,240
live i'm not

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,720
imagining smelling something from the

00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,799
past i'm literally doing that right now

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,320
same thing with touch so if you go

00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:04,720
through and say name three things you

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,440
could see smell touch taste or hear

00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,039
that's a huge way to help manage our

00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,039
emotional responses

00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,320
so that we're less overwhelmed and then

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,559
we can go finish

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,760
a job talk to a coworker or a

00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,679
significant other

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,799
it really helps sort of lower that

00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,000
threshold

00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:24,240
of emotion when we manage our emotions

00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,919
it also will help us manage our

00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,000
relationships all the better

00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,600
it's not uncommon to have strong

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,600
feelings about people

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:33,919
in terms of what they say or what they

00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,200
do especially when you're in close

00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:38,240
proximity

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:40,159
not that anybody is like that today

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,320
with our relationships with others

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,880
there's two c's that i want you to focus

00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,320
on

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:49,600
and that is compassion and curiosity

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,880
we all start in different places we all

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,159
have different strengths

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,880
weaknesses preferences

00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,840
all of those things and so when i

00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,080
approach another

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,320
and i make judgments around how they

00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,919
should be how they should performed

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:07,520
if i expect them to meet my expectations

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,200
i'm gonna end up having more trouble

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,000
with them because

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,480
look they might have challenges with

00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,880
something

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,720
that i don't and so i could look at them

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,880
with a sense of judgment

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,840
as opposed to compassion and going you

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,880
know what

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:25,919
if i were them or i had that background

00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,840
maybe i would struggle with that too and

00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,000
i could see why that would be hard today

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,880
we don't have to know even all of what's

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,720
beneath the

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,120
iceberg of the people we work and live

00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,240
beside in order for their struggle to

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,120
have validity

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,399
and that is why the curiosity is so

00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,240
important

00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:45,120
along with the compassion but the

00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,799
curiosity goes there's something else

00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,840
underneath that's likely driving how

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:51,120
they're responding

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:53,039
and so if i can go gosh

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,799
i wonder what happened before they got

00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,440
to work today before they bit my head

00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,640
off

00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:01,919
or you name it that

00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:04,320
allows us to be able to navigate our

00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:06,880
relationships with them differently

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,440
a great place to look into this further

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,279
is

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,760
kristin neff's work she's out of the

00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:13,919
university of texas at austin

00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,520
and she even talks about in her book on

00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,679
self-compassion

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,720
how valuable this is and learning this

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,600
for ourselves

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,000
ironically so that we can in turn extend

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,600
it

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:29,279
to others look at the end of the day so

00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:31,360
so so much of managing our lives has to

00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:34,679
do with managing ourselves

00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,840
and that involves my energy my output my

00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:38,559
relationships

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,679
my body there's so many different

00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:43,039
aspects

00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:46,000
at play and i just have to

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:47,360
invest in being a perpetual learner and

00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,840
that's part of why i am

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:52,240
so grateful to artifacts again to having

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,240
me that i can interface with all of you

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,000
thinkers out there and reflectors who

00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,559
are curious about

00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,080
mental health and being able to be your

00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,159
best self and so

00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,679
i would love to hear from you at any

00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,760
point throughout this week

00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:07,440
i'm happy to answer questions if you

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,559
have those as well

00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,039
and feel free to reach out to me over on

00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:15,360
brain science we're at changelog.com

00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:16,880
brain science you can find us on all the

00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,960
major podcasts

00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,159
and of course we also have our community

00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,480
in slack so

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,440
reach out say hi introduce yourself i'd

00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:37,150
love to meet you

00:30:23,440 --> 00:31:26,819
and thank you again

00:30:37,150 --> 00:31:26,819
[Music]

00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,840
do

00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,039
all right thank you marielle you're

00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:41,279
having me feel like i want some like

00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,279
good podcast intro and outro music every

00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:46,320
time i have a video call now

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:48,000
um uh so welcome thank you for joining

00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,440
us and thank you for your talk

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,200
um now's our q and a portion um we got a

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,919
question i'm hoping i can pronounce all

00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,519
these words

00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,679
uh are there natural ways to increase

00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:00,559
noefernephrine

00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,440
and eso chlorine prior to tests that

00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,080
require

00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,679
focus and or something you want to learn

00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,440
or does increasing these chemicals

00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,840
actually help with neuroplasticity

00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,960
specifically in adults

00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:16,799
yeah so can you hear me okay yeah

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,880
okay great so um yes there are natural

00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,080
ways to increase norepinephrine and

00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,559
acetylcholine

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,320
um so those are neurotransmitters and if

00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:26,480
you're not familiar with them

00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,559
they're sort of the fairy boat system

00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,279
between axons

00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,480
in our neural network okay so it's like

00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,320
unless there's

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,919
already been a way in which information

00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,679
is linked these

00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,840
neurotransmitters help carry the

00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:43,519
information down a pathway

00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,720
so exercise is actually the way in which

00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:48,080
we increase those

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:50,720
and so specific types of exercise work

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,440
differently for these neurotransmitters

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,960
for example

00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:58,480
yoga dance that seems to work more on

00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:01,120
dopamine whereas i want to say

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,240
um and i will double check this but

00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,440
norepinephrine

00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,559
is a hit training is where that can be

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,279
most helpful

00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,320
and serotonin is bilateral movements

00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:14,480
like swimming

00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:17,679
walking running um so as it relates to

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,600
neuroplasticity yes because um

00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,960
that's like i noted all of these are

00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,559
involved in that

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,919
bdnf growth when i exercise that's how i

00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,799
can

00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,799
improve my cognitive flexibility if you

00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,320
want a great resource there is a book

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,880
called spark

00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,120
that was written relative to exercise

00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,360
and sort of how it can help us

00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,720
um learn better so there's research i

00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,279
want to say out of

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,360
the school system in florida state and

00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,919
how kids who came in and started moving

00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,640
and exercising and did that more often

00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:51,120
actually were able to learn better and

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,240
so

00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,840
then what you said post-focused learning

00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,559
what is the best way to ingrain what was

00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,159
learned

00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:00,159
um there's a number of different

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:02,960
strategies relative to

00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,519
memory and remembering so the process of

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,919
memory

00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,039
involves three steps or stages there's

00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:09,839
encoding

00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,320
there's storage and there's retrieval

00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:13,919
and so

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,320
if nothing goes to get stored or banked

00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:17,599
there

00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:21,520
isn't retrieval because it's not there

00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:23,919
so um we the shift or in between

00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,960
that attention or sort of encoding and

00:34:23,919 --> 00:34:27,679
storage

00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,280
is only about 30 seconds long so your

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,000
brain makes a decision whether or not

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,240
it's going to

00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,079
assimilate it and consolidate it or let

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,240
it go

00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:39,119
we tend to remember information in

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,599
chunks of seven plus or minus two

00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,520
interestingly enough but there's all

00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,000
sorts of strategies so you can make

00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,399
information meaningful like i said

00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,560
in terms of how does it relate this is

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:53,359
why people create mnemonics or sort of

00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:54,079
short um words that help them remember

00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:56,320
certain things

00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,599
and that's why little things like name

00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,480
it to tame it

00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,839
are helpful so that you can remember so

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,520
that's a way of consolidating

00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:06,160
information to learn it better

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,200
to sort of have it for future reference

00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,200
yeah

00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,800
um and i know we're going to answer a

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,760
little bit of this in the next talk but

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,240
maybe you have

00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,000
some ideas empathy and compassion can be

00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,000
hard with the distributed team of people

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,920
who've never met in person um do you

00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,000
have any resources for group activities

00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,400
that could encourage stronger empathy

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,839
and compassion among your co-workers

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:28,000
yeah so one of the things

00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:30,160
that researchers have looked at is

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,920
actually the role of facial expression

00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,720
in emotion so ironically some people

00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,920
actually looked at

00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,079
i don't know if you've heard this that

00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,800
how couples will start to look more like

00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,520
each other

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,960
as they age and ironically because of

00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,440
that motor component

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,599
in empathy people when they're

00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,880
empathizing contort their faces

00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,760
similarly

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,680
hence as you age your face starts to

00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,760
have similar creases because you've been

00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:58,480
empathizing repeatedly

00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,400
so this is why like even after starting

00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:03,599
and doing brain science with

00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,400
um changelog we actually switched to

00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,880
recording

00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:08,720
with video so that is one of the most

00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,480
significant things i think is helpful

00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,760
with remote teams

00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:17,040
to help cultivate more empathy and

00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:19,440
really um i think about just even random

00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:22,880
games for example if i asked you

00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:26,320
you know think about a tree i suspect

00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:28,640
that where you live and what trees you

00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,320
typically think of is based on what

00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,079
you're most exposed to so if i lived in

00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,520
hawaii of course it wouldn't be crazy to

00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,760
think of a palm tree

00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,680
as opposed to my world in the pacific

00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:40,400
northwest where i would consider

00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,200
an evergreen so facilitating more of the

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,480
process

00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,440
of discovery in benign ways where people

00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,040
can sort of

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,800
say their sort of perspective or how

00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,480
they made sense of it can help you

00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,320
better learn and understand the people

00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,839
with whom you work

00:36:54,320 --> 00:37:00,000
yeah um somebody had asked uh for the

00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:01,599
body it's food exercise and sleep and

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,040
are there similar things that you can do

00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,839
to help take care of the brain or are

00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:09,359
they like about the same things

00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:09,920
um say that one more time so food sleep

00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,800
with the body

00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,960
uh they said for the body you need food

00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,480
exercise and sleep and are there similar

00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,160
things you can do to kind of help take

00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,000
care of the brain

00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:25,839
um well it's all sort of one in the same

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,160
um but there's research relative to

00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:30,079
inflammation and the foods that we eat

00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,079
and all of our bodies are different

00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,440
so this is why i really encourage people

00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,480
to be their own scientists

00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,400
like even you know foods might be

00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,079
upsetting to you like they don't sit

00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,520
well or make you feel good

00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,200
you know then it probably doesn't

00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,200
behoove you to eat those

00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,400
in the same way if sort of i have

00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,960
inflammation throughout my

00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,640
body that's sort of a signal like i'm

00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,400
going to be in more pain

00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,240
and then i'm going to have trouble

00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,520
navigating things differently

00:37:54,240 --> 00:38:00,800
because pain is so significant so

00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,200
really um inflammation is sort of the

00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,599
key

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,880
thing with that and we know you know

00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,280
sugar can cause

00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,480
um some more inflammation and there's

00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,240
certain foods

00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,160
and things like that that also

00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,000
contribute to how we feel

00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,680
um but all of our bodies are different

00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,599
so go

00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:33,839
explore and practice within those sort

00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:33,839
of different lanes

00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,320
