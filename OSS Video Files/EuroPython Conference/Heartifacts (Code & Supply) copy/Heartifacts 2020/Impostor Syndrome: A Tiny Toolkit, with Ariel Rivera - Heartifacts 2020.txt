Feeling like a fraud, or that you don’t deserve to be in the room, is sadly easy enough in any industry. In the tech landscape it’s that much simpler, with languages to learn, systems to understand, and roles to have experience in - and to my dismay, there’s no mockumentary or fine-tuned HBO show to allay the sentiment. Ideally, there’d be a series where there’s a “diverse and fun-loving group of friends who deal with imposter syndrome in moving up in their jobs and life in the big city”. Nothing brilliant by any means, but utterly relatable.

We don’t have that, at least not yet, but I’ve learned that imposter syndrome can be as big a beast as any, and I’ve read and experimented with small steps in how to try and get past those moments in which it causes anxiety.

In this talk, I’ll discuss experiences like job applications and networking events, and present my tiny toolkit of steps for handling imposter syndrome in a way that is honest and accepting for what works for you.

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,320
let's talk anyway no matter what field

00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,240
it's been

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,600
imposter syndrome has been really

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,360
familiar to me

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:15,120
and not a great thing it's unwelcome

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,760
but i've had it um always wants to hang

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,280
often wants to linger doesn't care about

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,920
making curfew

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,319
shows up when it wants to not a lot of

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,959
fun to deal with

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:31,440
uninvited so imposter syndrome

00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,720
what's the deal here i don't really care

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,120
for it

00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:39,840
i'm not a fan

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,080
so right now um we'll get into this

00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,200
what's imposter syndrome

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,160
what does it look like why you shouldn't

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,840
feel like the worst

00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,200
if you've experienced it and you

00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,720
shouldn't

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,280
and what we can do about it in small

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,440
steps and what i want to say

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,959
just as a note this is not a talk where

00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,360
i'll have a lot of imposter syndrome

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,120
statistics

00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,200
it's not something where i'm suggesting

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,800
broad changes

00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,959
um i'm very much focused on

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,440
tiny small things that you can do

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,239
practically

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,959
just in your regular everyday life

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,760
without

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,319
the big expectation that very quickly

00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,239
there will be this sudden change

00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,280
um and then there are other talks out

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,319
there that i just want to mention

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,000
they're really wonderful

00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:32,080
and do talk scientifically about uh

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,440
what kinds of groups or which pretty

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,200
much everyone

00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,440
get imposter syndrome or feel that way

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,080
and experience it um this is not that

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,680
but

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,760
i'm happy to point you in that direction

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,319
as well uh there's a lot of great things

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,120
out there

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,840
and uh people who discuss it um so just

00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,840
as a note

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:55,360
so imposter syndrome this is it right

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,920
um i don't know i i haven't seen the

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,319
show

00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,680
maybe i want to see the show if you've

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,920
seen the show

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,319
tell me if it's good i don't really know

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:09,280
what it's about

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:11,920
um it's this a psychological condition

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,120
um that involves persistent doubt

00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,640
concerning one's abilities or

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,799
accomplishments

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,079
accompanied by the fear of being exposed

00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,320
as a fraud

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,840
despite evidence of one's ongoing

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,479
success

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,040
um so i just want to stress there's this

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:29,840
persistent doubt

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,479
you're not feeling good um and there's

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:36,400
that fear of being exposed as a fraud

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:38,320
you feel like a fake um and it can get

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,160
near on ridiculous because as the

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,199
definition says and it was just added to

00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,400
the dictionary

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:47,600
um in april which is kind of funny

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,800
uh this is in spite of ongoing success

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,880
um so you can be doing really well

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,280
and you know in the workplace let's say

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,360
you can have your colleagues who

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,880
who rely on you and trust you and who

00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,000
would otherwise probably say really

00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,120
great things about you

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,160
but for you you still have this notion

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,520
that you know maybe you don't quite

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,680
belong there

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,560
um and i just want to point out the

00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,160
difference between an

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,080
actual imposter here which is why this

00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,160
is crossed out and

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,680
imposter syndrome um when you're

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,120
actually an imposter

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,759
you're actually trying to deceive

00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,199
someone and you are trying to be a fake

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,320
for fraud

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:29,199
that's a difference it's intentional

00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,440
um with imposter syndrome you're quite

00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:34,160
feeling like you are

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,720
but you're really not it's not an

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,160
activity

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,960
it's not a hobby of yours it's not real

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,400
you're not actually the fraud and if

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,440
there's something that

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,479
could make you feel that way hopefully

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,880
you can take steps to change it um but

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:54,639
with imposter syndrome

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:58,080
it can bring up these sentiments

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,520
i'm a fake i'm a fraud i'm not good

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,759
enough

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,039
i don't deserve what i have or maybe the

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,400
other people in the room do

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:09,520
but i don't i don't know how i got here

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,199
um and i don't belong here not with them

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,720
i'm not smart enough i'm not funny

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:18,240
enough i'm not good enough

00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,880
so and this is like whoa

00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,479
not feeling not feeling so hot when this

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,440
suddenly happens

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,440
we're not so suddenly

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,880
have you ever experienced this um if you

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,000
have

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,479
a lot of people do it's it's very common

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,080
um you know these are some people by

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,680
their own admission who have been in the

00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,280
same boat

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:46,840
so you know politicians

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,680
writers uh celebrities

00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:53,199
actors um

00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:57,840
i guess i guess you can ignore cat pen

00:06:53,199 --> 00:07:00,240
fine um but anyway it's very common

00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,000
and it happens in multiple spheres of

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,199
one's life so it can be socially

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,960
it could be professionally in academia

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,160
um any realm this can just kind of pop

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:15,680
up

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:18,639
so not not great but you're not alone

00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,199
i've been feeling it for years um so

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,800
here's me

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,479
i'm here trying to intimidate imposter

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,720
syndrome you know like

00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,080
it popped up and it's here and i'm like

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,400
hey you get out of here

00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,720
i want to feel really good right now

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,960
we're not doing this and then within

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,199
seconds uh you can see that

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,000
i'm basically getting eaten up by

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,360
pac-man

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,840
or uh you know he's holding on to me for

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,400
any moment now um that that's going to

00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,440
happen

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,759
um and i will want to say it's again

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,080
very common um anytime i've brought up

00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,840
imposter syndrome to anyone

00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,240
the overwhelming majority of the time

00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,919
they tend to fall into one of two camps

00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,520
so either they've heard of it and they

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:03,120
can totally relate and they're like

00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:06,080
i've had that i don't like it or

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,759
they've never heard of the term but now

00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,240
they're starting to think of times when

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,360
maybe

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,560
they've experienced it so i'm not saying

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,120
everyone

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,800
but i'm seeing it's pretty common there

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,680
are a lot of people out there

00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,199
um so it's okay and you're not on your

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,879
own

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:29,039
and for me let's see whoa

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:32,479
what music video is this think about it

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,680
we're not but i have this here because i

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,599
can think of some times when i've

00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,360
experienced imposter syndrome

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:42,800
um and they really range

00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,720
areas of my life um so even just going

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,600
to like bar trivia

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,519
i've almost gotten kicked off of my team

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,680
not because i wasn't good at

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,600
answering or coming up with anything and

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,560
i'm really bad at that

00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,519
um but more because when i did know the

00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,839
answer

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,839
i wouldn't say anything i would look

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,959
around at my team

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,360
and i'd be like oh i really think it's

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,160
this

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,360
but you know like someone else would

00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,200
have

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,560
probably would have said that by now and

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,880
if you know

00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,680
if they think you know that's that's

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,360
this person

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,360
that they they must be right you know i

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,720
everyone here's green and i probably

00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,519
like

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,040
i probably don't know what i'm talking

00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,440
about

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,399
so even in trivia that would happen and

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,279
then after when we get the answer wrong

00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,320
because i didn't input like didn't say

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,200
what i

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,600
what i really thought was right about it

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,440
uh i'd have to be like oh my god

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,760
oh my god i knew that

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,959
and it would make everyone frustrated

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,519
because

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,399
it was over weeks and months and this

00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,399
would keep happening

00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,399
and once again i almost got kicked off

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,640
not because of wrong answers but because

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,560
i just wasn't sharing what i thought

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,480
and everyone thought it was okay for you

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,320
to be wrong as long as you try to

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,640
contribute

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,560
so that's for me socially um i've had

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,760
plenty of other times where

00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:17,519
imposter syndrome's come up and i can

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,839
think of recently even

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,920
at my current job i've only been working

00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,279
there since january

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,480
and it's a legal tech non-profit so we

00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:29,519
help um

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,519
other nonprofits

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:36,959
help people who who need legal resources

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,320
and that involves not just building

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,360
online tools

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:44,560
but also having some legal knowledge

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,560
i have zero legal backgrounds

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,959
so when i'm sitting in a meeting with my

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,320
colleagues people on my team

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:54,399
people i really like and get along with

00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,800
and see or talk to you every week even

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,279
if it's just virtually

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,160
i look around and i'm i think about the

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:05,200
our content meetings for example

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:09,120
i don't know these legal issues

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,440
i'm not a lawyer why am i here

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,399
i get very anxious i start to think you

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,560
know what

00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,399
i love this job but i don't know if i

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,079
belong here

00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,120
and that's another example of where it's

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:24,640
really not fair to myself

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:27,440
because i am there for a reason

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,000
and i do have the technical background

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,120
to do my

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,440
job well that's why i'm there

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,040
and that's why i've been there since

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,920
january

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,920
um but it's hard in the moment it's very

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,320
easy to fall into those

00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,760
those times when you're saying well you

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,000
know there's one thing

00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,279
and now it's just not good enough i

00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,279
don't really know what to do about it

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,800
the other thing i can think of is even

00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,399
in

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,959
coming up with this talk and thinking

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,959
about being here with you

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,880
um one of my co-workers in another

00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,240
department had said like why is it a

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,680
tiny toolkit

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,360
does that show that you have imposter

00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,480
syndrome why are you saying it's just

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,959
tiny

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,240
and that kind of stuck with me i'm like

00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,880
why

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,519
why would i just offer tiny is there

00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:18,240
something wrong with me for saying that

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,040
um but really in all honesty i just

00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,240
think

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,600
well for what i've needed i just need

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:28,240
really small

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:31,519
bits and i know that i just need

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:34,560
to go with tiny steps

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:37,279
and posture isn't hard enough as it is

00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,720
when you can plan for it um and you

00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,320
don't want to set yourself up from

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,320
failure at least not to me

00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:56,000
but anyway it's ongoing

00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:59,200
but i'm better off now that i'm able to

00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,200
reflect on it than before

00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,519
if it's so common with people why is

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,079
this even happening

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,320
well there are a lot of factors here

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,360
there's a lot going on

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,480
um i would say at least within tech

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,480
there's so much pressure

00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,560
you know their insecurities about one's

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,519
own ability

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,000
uh your educational background maybe

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,320
your

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:34,079
income background um how you got there

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,519
where you're going um you know dude

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,279
there's always a question on me like did

00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,880
i go to a boot camp

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:43,680
did i go to a college for this

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,880
you know who do i know if i'm not in

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,320
with certain

00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,959
networks am i less than

00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,320
um so there's a lot of pressure there

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,920
and i think that's the nature of the

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:57,920
industry

00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:01,040
new languages updating systems

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,199
being expected to know how things are

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,920
changing as they're changing

00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,680
um is something that is not necessarily

00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:11,279
unique to this industry but

00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:14,800
one that does not

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,800
quite fall into line with others

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,480
and then there's perceived expectations

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,120
concerning work performance

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,360
um not just from managers from but also

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,040
from your peers

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,639
i say there's a lot of pressure and

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,440
there can be a lot of doubt that comes

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,720
from

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,120
even like work life balance

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,040
are you able to take breaks are you

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,320
supposed to be on call

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,320
at any given moment in the day

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,399
what's the expectation for being someone

00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,839
who knows everything

00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,000
are you in a work culture where you can

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,639
ask questions

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,079
are you in a place where you can act as

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,000
a team

00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,000
or is there some kind of fault there if

00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,440
you can admit that maybe you don't know

00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,360
everything

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:06,079
or that you want to ask ask for help

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,079
ask for guidance ask for a mentor

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:16,320
so there are plenty of talks that can uh

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,839
go into why this happens

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,959
why it's so common but um

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:25,279
that deserves its own discussion why not

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:28,800
just get over it

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:31,519
well i really hate that i feel like

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,959
people mean well and you might have a

00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,399
friend who says like oh you're feeling

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,720
bad you know

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,240
oh that's terrible but you know what

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,959
this is gonna pass in a second

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,240
and that's great um but then there's

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,000
some people are really like

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,959
that's not real what are you talking

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:50,399
about get over it

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:53,600
and i could get upset about this

00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,600
but really i'll just say

00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,279
imposter syndrome is an ongoing issue

00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,399
again

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:03,199
and it is one that goes on

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,040
just as much as it's situational and

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,240
every person's unique

00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,720
and you have your own personal

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,720
experience it with it

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,480
not just when it happens but also in

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,759
addressing it

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:15,759
and in your response

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:22,000
so i would just hope that everyone here

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,440
knows that

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,920
not just get over it it's probably not

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:29,600
the right question to ask

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,600
even if you mean well

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,320
um and let's see why is it not the right

00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,880
thing

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,320
um i'd say another reason it's not the

00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,320
right thing

00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:45,759
is that this is happening in real time

00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:49,279
so i know myself

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,079
that i have experienced imposter

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,279
syndrome

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:56,240
and i can anticipate it sometimes

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,759
but often it's just happening it's

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,399
happening in a moment

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:01,920
it's happening in real time i'm already

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,480
in the media and i already feel like my

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,039
input

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:09,600
doesn't mean as much i could be

00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:12,000
i could consider applying for a job or

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,000
going to an interview

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,360
and then the deadline is here or the

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,880
moment is about to come and i'm just

00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:19,039
thinking you know what

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,160
someone else out there they deserve it

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,319
more

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,079
we can be in the same level be

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,919
colleagues and i just would think

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,079
you know i i don't think i have what it

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,240
takes maybe maybe i won't bother maybe

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:33,039
i'm gonna cancel

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,000
it's happening in real time plenty of

00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,679
times where i've thought

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,200
you know like oh man i'm so stoked to go

00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,440
to this event you know

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,799
i'm not big on networking but i'm

00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,480
excited for this one

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,080
and then the time comes and i'm just

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,160
thinking you know like i'm i'm gonna go

00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:49,360
back and let's say i'm just gonna

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,720
cancel i'm not gonna be able to talk to

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,880
anyone

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,240
no one's gonna want to talk to me it's

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,679
not gonna feel good i'll have nothing to

00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,840
say

00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,080
or here you know you sign up for a

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,120
conference

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,200
and uh even though it's

00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:06,480
possibly a conference that is specific

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,240
in theme

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,799
and everyone else is signing up for it

00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:13,760
for this specific theme

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,600
you just decide well maybe you're the

00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,280
odd one out

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,480
maybe you don't want to go maybe you

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:23,120
don't want to participate it's just

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,720
not worth it you don't have anything

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,679
good to say

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,000
these are all the things that are

00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:32,880
happening in that real moment in real

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,760
time so you can't quite get over it

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,760
not that easily

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,600
so no matter what the situation may be

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,039
um i think the sentiments are relatable

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,280
even if it happens for us in different

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:47,760
moments it's tiring

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:49,919
it's a bummer let's do something about

00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,919
it

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:56,480
tiny toolkit anyway

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,559
i just want to reiterate that these are

00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,440
small things

00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,480
and they're small for a reason and it's

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:06,240
because

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:08,840
once again imposter syndrome is hard

00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,919
enough as it is

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,400
and i would rather not set myself up

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,640
to be disappointed by trying to make

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,480
broad changes

00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,760
in a matter of just a few minutes or

00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,760
days

00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:26,799
and i also want to admit that

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,320
it isn't just a solution situation it's

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:32,559
about meeting it

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:39,840
um addressing it and hoping that you can

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:39,840
manage your response as it's happening

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,520
so i'm thinking about small actions um

00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,679
some things to remember

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,880
and then you can decide what mental

00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,640
image you might want for your toolkit um

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,640
i was recently thinking maybe hello

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,480
kitty and her twin sister mimi

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,360
uh maybe you don't want to do that for

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:07,039
yourself um

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:11,120
let me know it's not necessary though

00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:12,400
all right first thing i would always do

00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,640
once i decided that i just started

00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,640
addressing this is brainstorm

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,200
from what you've heard i've experienced

00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,520
this quite a bit

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,559
and even though it'll just pop up

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,559
sometimes

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:28,000
for me since i know there are certain

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:32,640
stressors

00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,640
i decided well what are those stressors

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,720
is it a meeting for me it's a content

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,640
meeting

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,000
because i don't create content and i'm

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,440
in that meeting

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,840
and maybe i just feel like i don't

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,840
belong

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,679
for you is it seeing people just

00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,799
generally

00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:55,039
um is it an event is there anything that

00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:58,080
you can anticipate

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,840
um and so the small step here i would

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:04,320
say first

00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:06,159
is jotting it down or brainstorming

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,080
if this is something that is a little

00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,679
too stressful in itself

00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,280
don't do it but for me i just think just

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,960
the act of writing

00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:19,440
in a journal or trying to

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,880
acknowledge what those stressors are is

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,320
helpful

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:26,720
um and then once i see

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,240
at least okay well i know i'm going to

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,559
be doing this weekly

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,240
and i don't feel good about it what can

00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:35,120
i do about it

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,080
and i think small things i can do just

00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,720
as an example

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,159
and everyone is different um schedule

00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,400
out a few minutes before meeting to take

00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:47,919
a walk

00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,200
scheduling out time to look at the

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,640
agenda again

00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,480
it's a matter of knowing yourself and

00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,039
knowing if you want to check in or check

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,520
out

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:58,640
and which is going to be more relaxing

00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,159
or less stressful for you

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,960
um scheduling time to reach out to

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:06,640
someone that you trust or support

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:10,640
um and it that can be a check-in

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,280
i would say you can talk about what it

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,400
is that

00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:17,520
you're expecting or not sure about

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,520
or it can just be high

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,080
before uh joining this morning on this

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,840
call

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,360
i really just went on instagram and just

00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,799
let me just be mindless for a moment

00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,799
that's what's going to be what's right

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,799
for me just for a few minutes

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,559
and i would say the important thing is

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:38,960
to take uh the small moments

00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,320
to plan because there's so much about

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,760
experience and posture syndrome that's

00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,960
unexpected

00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,960
so why not do what you can

00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:50,960
once again reach out do you have someone

00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,720
that you trust

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:57,120
um a friend of yours a colleague

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,280
someone who could be supportive of you

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,400
reach out to them

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:04,640
um and try to think of someone that you

00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,520
can consistently reach out to

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:09,440
and that once again is a small thing you

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,640
don't

00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:15,760
have to unload or

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,280
try to make some kind of plan to resolve

00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,760
things necessarily

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,720
it's more that you can plan right before

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,400
the thing that's

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,640
like the event that is going to be

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,240
stressful or that you anticipate being

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,600
stressful

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,720
um and just shoot a text

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,480
whatever works for you you could say

00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,000
like hey i'm going to this i don't feel

00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:37,360
that great about it

00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,080
i think i mentioned it to you before or

00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,000
once again if checking out is better

00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,760
saying like hey yeah send me a cat photo

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,440
that's that's what i'm looking for right

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,360
now

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,960
and i would say if you have a friend or

00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,240
colleague or someone that you can reach

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,760
out to

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,240
i definitely recommend if you can

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,120
that's someone who will nudge you and

00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,120
will say like oh

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,559
you're nervous about it like maybe i

00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,559
know you really wanted to go to this

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:09,600
maybe you should or ask you you know

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,200
what's the harm but also have it be

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,600
someone who knows

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,960
you or your situation well enough to not

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,559
push

00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:21,120
not too hard because that's also not

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,120
fair to you

00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:27,679
similarly uh find your network so

00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,080
whether or not you have someone you can

00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:33,600
turn to specifically

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,880
i'd also recommend this um just in terms

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,320
of like networking

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,400
i used to be extremely anxious and i

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,400
couldn't really go to any events

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,480
um i just didn't feel like anyone would

00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,919
want to hear what i had to say

00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:51,360
or even chat over soda um

00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:54,559
i'd say an online community for example

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:57,520
like code in supply their slack channel

00:24:54,559 --> 00:25:00,640
um or for me women who code i would say

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:04,559
that can be really low pressure

00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:06,320
um these communities often have channels

00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,000
also that go beyond their mission

00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,120
statement um

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,080
so you think women who code okay i mean

00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,120
maybe you're thinking

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,799
of women and coding

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,640
but there are also channels just about

00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:22,720
things like speaking

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,080
um you know different slack communities

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,640
have specific channels around mental

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:30,000
health a safe space

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,679
even virtually that's low pressure

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,919
where you can talk about things are very

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,960
relatable

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,919
and so the small stuff there is to seek

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,840
that out

00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,279
um and i can definitely help if you want

00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,440
to chat with me about that

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,880
about how to start um but you know

00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,720
i don't know if you've heard of google

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,760
but that works and even

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,279
uh within this community uh

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,960
i'm pretty sure there are people who

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,880
know networks that

00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,080
might work for you um based on what

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,480
you're interested in

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,600
um but it's very low pressure which is

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,640
why

00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,840
i recommend this you can participate or

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,919
you can just be a lurker

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:11,200
for a bit until you get comfortable um

00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,640
but uh

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,039
that's really what's made a difference

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,640
for me uh many a time

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,880
and getting more comfortable and

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,120
actually being in a space with others

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,120
and

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:25,279
feeling like maybe i do belong there

00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:27,279
um i'm gonna move a little faster now

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:31,120
but uh another thing is that

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:33,360
noting literally the positive um

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,120
this is a key thing about tiny toolkit

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:38,880
i'd say

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,440
um for all these negative feelings about

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,039
feeling

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:47,120
like you're a fraud uh what do you know

00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:49,760
that you're doing right write it down

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,799
literally um i definitely recommend

00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:53,120
making little cards

00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:54,960
little notes you know like hey you know

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,520
this is why i'm at this job this is why

00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:01,279
they hired me

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:04,080
i did this right i'm feeling really good

00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,960
i'd say it's tiny cards or a tiny

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,320
notebook

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,240
but it has to be something that you can

00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,039
hold and have with you

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,159
um or if you actually look at all your

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,000
apps

00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,200
i get overwhelmed by my apps so i

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,039
wouldn't use a notes app

00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,720
but if you actually would use and look

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:22,240
at inner notes app

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:26,159
that's also an option as well um

00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,240
and i would just say it's so hard

00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,840
to find some things like that sometimes

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,360
on your own especially when you're not

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,360
feeling good

00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,760
and that's when i would say maybe reach

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,760
out to a friend or say like hey like

00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,960
what's that thing that you said or find

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:45,120
an email even have a birthday email

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:49,200
find the positive and make it small

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:51,120
and something that you can have with you

00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,320
make your moments i feel like people

00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,600
have been talking about this in

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:59,600
other talks completely unrelated to this

00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:02,480
but absolutely make your moments um

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,039
when you're stressed it's pausing my

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,279
timer

00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,520
so i know i'm almost out when you're

00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:10,159
stressed

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,360
sometimes you really just need to check

00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,960
in

00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,799
about what else you're doing like

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,159
outside of work do you want to learn

00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:17,760
something new

00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:21,360
can you start a new hobby go back to an

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:23,360
old hobby do you just want to take a nap

00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,720
make sure that you're taking time for

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:27,760
this

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,200
um if your work's your life

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,000
that's not going to help you in your

00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,279
moments when you're especially stressed

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,200
and it's not going to lead you in the

00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,640
right direction

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,559
and i would just acknowledge it even if

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,120
it's taking a nap and making time

00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:45,679
for that if that's what you want that's

00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:48,080
absolutely a good thing

00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,279
i say push yourself things are going to

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,039
happen not necessarily when you're

00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,640
expecting it

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,320
and don't give up the first time when

00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,120
you have your inner voice saying that

00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,159
you're not

00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:00,799
quite good enough um

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,360
it's just going to happen and all you

00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,559
can do

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:09,360
is practice and try

00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:09,360
to push back on that voice

00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,679
by the way that music video is britney

00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:17,200
spears toxic

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:21,120
and uh i only mentioned that because

00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:23,440
finally at trivia someone asked

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,240
what that music video was in a visual

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,840
round

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,279
and i think that was one of the first

00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:31,200
times that i said

00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:33,360
i know what that is um

00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,200
instead of looking around and just

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,640
thinking

00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:41,600
no one's mentioned this yet i don't have

00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,600
anything to say here

00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,640
finally answered and if you haven't seen

00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,640
that video it's pretty silly

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,200
and then some final things to remember

00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:53,120
once again you're not alone in this

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,480
it's common that might not always make

00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,520
you feel too good

00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:00,720
anyway um but

00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:02,960
you know there's nothing wrong with it

00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,919
um it's okay to take steps at your own

00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,799
pace

00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:11,120
you should um because it's you

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,960
and it's okay to make mistakes you don't

00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,520
want to compare yourself to others

00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,159
that's also really hard um but what you

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,640
can do

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,159
is try to remember what you're doing

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:25,360
right

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:28,960
and that you know you're on your way

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:32,000
um start small so even just five minutes

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,880
um even just a few notes don't pressure

00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,760
yourself

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:39,840
to do everything all at once

00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,799
and thanks i'm grateful for this

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,600
community

00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,600
um i'd love to keep the discussion going

00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,600
and i'm happy to share resources

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,039
about many many things around this topic

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:51,919
of imposter syndrome

00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:54,399
that i couldn't even get to today thanks

00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,399
very much

00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,679
all right thank you ari that was great

00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,200
um

00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,279
one of the things you'd mentioned was

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,120
having a friend to reach out

00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,200
um do you think it's helpful for this

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:11,200
friend to be somebody outside of work

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,200
or a co-worker or perhaps both

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,159
i would say

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:21,039
um that's one thing that i definitely

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,320
recommending doing your own small

00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:25,679
brainstorm for um

00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,519
there are times when i've had

00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,200
specifically a work friend

00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,880
and if you would have that connection

00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,320
with someone in your workplace i'd say

00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,799
take advantage of it

00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,600
um because they really will probably

00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,720
have similar

00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,279
experience with you maybe they're

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:42,880
dealing with the same management manager

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:44,960
um or uh on the same

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,960
road map in terms of a project and

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,720
dealing with similar stressors

00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,840
so even if they're obviously a different

00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:55,679
person i think a workplace

00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:58,240
person to confide in is really helpful

00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:00,000
but at the same time if you're even

00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,000
nervous about talking about with someone

00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,279
in your workplace about even feeling

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,360
this way

00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,559
if you have someone who just understands

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,679
you and is a friend

00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,480
there's nothing wrong with that either

00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,559
and i encourage it more the merrier

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,960
even though i do think you should start

00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:16,399
with one main person for check-ins

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,799
if it's something that's really giving

00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:21,919
you anxiety

00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:24,399
yeah um so for you

00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,640
personally do you feel like over time

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,399
just your awareness of imposter syndrome

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:30,159
and knowing about your toolkit that

00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:33,120
you've come up with helps make it less

00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,120
intense over time

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,880
yes but uh for me um one yeah absolutely

00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,080
not speaking to anyone else's experience

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:43,600
um

00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:46,159
and there are plenty of times when

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,240
i still am thinking at the last thing

00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:51,200
i'm like i'm i'm not gonna do that

00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,000
no one's gonna want to talk to me um so

00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,840
it's

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,279
not foolproof um but at the same time

00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,559
when i wasn't addressing it

00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,080
or if i didn't even really know that

00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,799
that imposter syndrome was something

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,120
that

00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,000
related to me and for a long time i

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,240
didn't

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,039
um you know i wasn't searching for

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,799
something i didn't

00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:14,159
know about uh i'm better off now

00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:17,360
um and it can be really hard but

00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:20,240
i'd say even just you know like i said

00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,679
that meeting that is a stressor i

00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,799
i can go on instagram for five minutes

00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,080
so i wanna that's one of those times

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,720
where i'm not checking in to the

00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:27,360
stressor

00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,640
um every situation is different for me

00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,840
but that's one example of time where i'm

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,720
like i'm checking out for five minutes

00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:34,080
right before

00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,320
i'm looking at some memes and uh

00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,600
it can be really helpful but it is

00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,760
something that

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,200
i've practiced i hate using that word

00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,240
because it's so personal

00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,320
and it you can't practice enough to

00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,519
point like oh i'm gonna learn this chord

00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,559
on a guitar

00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:53,360
so it's not the same as that um

00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,320
but it's it's like the muscle memory in

00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,399
its own way

00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,240
so it has been helpful as long as i

00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,399
acknowledge that the tiny steps are what

00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,000
work for me and

00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:07,840
then it's not the end of the world if i

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,840
am having a bad day anyway

00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,879
