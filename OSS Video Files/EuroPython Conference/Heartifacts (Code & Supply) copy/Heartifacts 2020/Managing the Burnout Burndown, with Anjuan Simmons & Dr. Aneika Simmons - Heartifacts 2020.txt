Engineering managers are, almost by definition, highly capable and strongly driven individuals. These traits are indispensable to success in leading software engineering teams, but they are also the very traits that make engineering managers susceptible to burn out. People who can get things done often find themselves overwhelmed by their to-do lists.

This talk will combine the understanding from the trenches of Anjuan Simmons (who has been an engineering manager for more than 20 years) with the academic understanding of his wife, Dr. Aneika Simmons. Together, they will provide a framework for reducing burnout and consistently keeping stress levels in a managed state.

all right in case you haven't heard

00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,919
2020 has been a bit of a rough year with

00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,280
the pandemic among what feels like a

00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,880
million other things

00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,480
you're probably a bit burnt out which is

00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,519
why our first talk of the conference is

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,759

the two of them will be sharing about

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,799
how you can manage the burnout burn down

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,640
so here they are dr enika simmons and

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,520
anwan simmons

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,159
hello i'm edwan simmons and i'm dr anika

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,920
simmons

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,079
and this is our talk on managing the

00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,600
burnout burndown so let's

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:48,960
get right to it

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,240
so if you're like me then you work in

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,360
software and

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:54,079
you are just a real fan of the fact that

00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,719
we can turn

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,159
any idea into working software that

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,880
anything that we think of

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,240
that we think our users won't can become

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,240
code and

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,240
the excitement around this has been

00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,600
something that the media often reports

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,000
on the idea that these

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,959
amazing companies that most of us use

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,640
some of their

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:17,599
software to figure all daily lives

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,360
started in garages as just ideas and so

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,480
there's a lot of press about how

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,680
software is cool in fact this

00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:29,120
exuberance has even come from

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,200
the levels of companies that most of us

00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,200
uh have heard of to even our day-to-day

00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,800
lives and the idea that

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,599
anyone can take a really easy to use

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,040
language

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,920
and then create something everyone

00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,959
carries around in their pockets to use

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,879
every day but there is a dark side to

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,400
building software that is not as well

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,519
covered in the media

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,840
and that's the fact that building

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,840
software can be exhausting

00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,840
and some of this exhaustion is due to

00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,519
the fact that software is an industry

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,080
that's always changing

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,200
there is some new language or framework

00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,640
or technology

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:06,319
that we need to use to do our daily work

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,400
and for a lot of people this is really

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,120
surprising because software's not like

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,280
construction

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,040
and most of you watching this you're in

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,319
a building that has a floor and it has

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,560
walls and a ceiling

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,599
and people actually did labor to lay

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,239
that floor and

00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,680
hang the drywall on those walls and put

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,000
up the light fixtures

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,519
and so we think about that as labor and

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,360
we don't think of building software as

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,080
labor because often we're sitting at our

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,560
desk and

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,560
we may have some nice well-crafted

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,200
coffee next to us and we are

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,159
usually sitting in nice plush chairs but

00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,200
building software

00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,840
is labor uh it is work that it does

00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,040
extract a cost to the people who work in

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,720
software development

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,120
and and it's this dark side of software

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,280
development that we often don't

00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,560
talk about and the fact is that building

00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,519
software does

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,480
put a mental and psychological burden on

00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,920
the people

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,519
who write software and those are the

00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,200
engineers the testers the project

00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,760
managers everyone involved

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,040
feels this burden and so

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,799
we don't really have a lot of language

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,159
around this burden and so we really

00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:10,080
wrote this talk

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,599
to be able to help people who have

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,280
worked in software development

00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:17,759
understand ways to cope another part of

00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,359
why software can be such a burden is the

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,959
idea of always be shipping

00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,720
and this is something that many of you

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,800
have heard about and maybe

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,400
your manager or your manager who has

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,080
used this term

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,400
and this is the idea that if we're

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,280
always shipping features to users

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,800
then we are always justifying the reason

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,759
that our team exists

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,720
but the reality is that any system that

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,600
is always on

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,040
will fail and you have to take time to

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,440
take the system offline

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,280
and maintenance it give it a chance to

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,120
rest give it a chance

00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,800
to be restored and i am before you right

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,960
now and we both

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,840
experience a degree of stress and that

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,960
stress

00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:02,400
if left unmanaged will lead to burnout

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,840
and burned out people burn out they burn

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,840
down valuable things

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:07,520
but they also go outside of structures

00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,240
that we set up for the team and for the

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,160
company

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,320
and maybe you've seen people burn down

00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,120
code by introducing bugs when they

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,600
usually

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,400
have not done that or they start to

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,160
become

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,520
argumentative and they sometimes burn

00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,800
down relationships with the people who

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,720
are on the team

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,880
and then they go out they go out of

00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,199
communication tools like slack

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,120
or the documentation that the team is

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,759
using to track what we do

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,240
and you begin to see their contributions

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,759
begin

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:38,560
to slow down and trickle down over time

00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,120
and so we really need to take stress and

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,360
managing

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,320
seriously and a big reason why we wrote

00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,880
this talk

00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,479
is to do just that to present a really

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,039
easy to use framework

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,680
because if you don't handle stress then

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,000
your team

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,360
will begin to be handled by it and

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,080
you'll see always be

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,560
shipping turn to always be slipping as

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,880
your team slips deadline after deadline

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,000
as they labor under the weight of being

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,360
burned out

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,440
now this is something that i'm happy to

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,960
have my wife here with me

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,800
because she's going to go some she's

00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,600
going to go over some of the academic

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,880
research

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,880
behind burnout thank you and one

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,400
yes so really we have an issue here and

00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,160
it's called the burnout problem

00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,919
now being married to someone who's built

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,080
enterprise software for more than two

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,720
decades and myself i used to work for

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,319
accenture and captain ernst young as a

00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,639
information technologist

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,400
i've also seen firsthand the experience

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:31,440
of stress in this industry but also as

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,680
an academic

00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,440
i see it as well so as a business

00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,080
professor i've studied the research that

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,759
proves

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,280
burnout isn't something that only

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,680
happens to my family

00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,960
it's a com it's an issue that is common

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,759
to man

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,560
so before we go further let's define

00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,400
burnout

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,400
we've looked at a number of academic and

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,840
contemporary resources to get a working

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,599
definition of burnout

00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,759
and here's what we've come up with as

00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:58,880
stated in the june 2016

00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:01,520
issue of world psychiatry burnout is a

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,840
psychological syndrome emerging as a

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,919
prolonged response to chronic

00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,000
interpersonal stressors on the job

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,520
now stressors are what cause stress

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,360
stress is what i feel

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,800
the three key dimensions of this

00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,520
response are number one

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,479
an overwhelming feeling of exhaustion

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,120
number two

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,160
a feeling of cynicism and detachment

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,800
from the job

00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,319
and third a sense of ineffectiveness and

00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,039
a lack of accomplishment

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,680
so to put it simply burnout is the

00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:32,000
ongoing feeling that today's resources

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,240
aren't enough to meet tomorrow's demands

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,080
we're here today to focus on how burnout

00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,840
affects those who are part of

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,599
software development teams but it's a

00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:43,520
problem that spans

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,240
multiple industries the three dimensions

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,560
of burnout

00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,919
let's kind of dig deeper emotional

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,720
exhaustion well this is an

00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,560
overall lack of energy in a sense that

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,879
your emotional resources are being

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,000
fully consumed by work that means that

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,599
when you come home

00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,039
you feel like you have nothing left to

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,400
give to the things or the people that

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,560
you love

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:04,160
depersonalization is the second one this

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,720
signifies an unfeeling

00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,960
cynical or even impersonal response

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,639
toward the recipients of one service

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,000
this is like when you go to the hospital

00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,879
to check on a friend and the nurse

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,639
says there's a broken arm in room two

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,440
that nurse has stopped seeing patients

00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,280
as people

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,560
and just these them as a problem to fix

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,599
and i've experienced that

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,560
myself while i was addressed as just a

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,400
problem like oh

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,759
you know the the stomach element there

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,120
in room three um

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,039
i have to give my stuff and go so you

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,599
gotta be careful with that and number

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,399
three

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,640
reduce personal accomplishment this is

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,440
marked by a tendency to evaluate oneself

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,039
negatively

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,560
particularly with regard to work with

00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,279
clients you begin to be

00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,640
overly critical of your work which leads

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,080
to self-criticism

00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:51,040
which is no good now

00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,519
widespread burnout how widespread is it

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,640
well

00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,640
a gallup workplace poll did a three-part

00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,959
series last year on employees burnout

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,640
it showed that burnout is a very common

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:04,160
problem in fact

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,920
23 percent of 7 500 respondents

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,600
reporting feeling burned out at

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:12,080
work very often are always while 44

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,880
said they felt burned out sometimes that

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,800
means almost

00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,399
two-thirds of full-time workers

00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,240
experience some degree of burnout

00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,000
you may be thinking well my team is

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,480
highly engaged how could they be burnt

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,640
up

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,560
surely they can't be we have hackathons

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,880
video consoles in the office we keep the

00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,720
bar

00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,920
stock with beer when we were all at work

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,080
of course and

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,000
people love hanging out at the office

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,080
while engagement is often seen as the

00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,080
opposite of burnout the university of

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,120
cambridge published an article

00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,480
in february 2018 that showed even highly

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,200
engaged employees

00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,360
are subject to burnout the article cited

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,959
a study published in 2018

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,360
by the crew development international

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,519
journal which states interestingly many

00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,800
employees appear to be optimally engaged

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,800
while they are burned out and

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,800
considering leaving the company

00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,800
the article observed the highest

00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,160
turnover intentions were reported by the

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,560
highly engaged

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,480
exhausted group higher than even the

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,079
unengaged group that might be commonly

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,399
expected to be eyeing an exit

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,600
so i can be highly engaged and exhausted

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,240
and want a way out

00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,160
well why is this well there's an

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,560
individual cost to burnout

00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,240
ignoring burnout can present significant

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,560
consequences to individuals

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,640
when we first gave this talk in april

00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,680
2019 i can't believe it's been over a

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,760
year babe

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,320
in new york city there was no medical

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,560
diagnosis diagnosis for burnout however

00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,079
in late may of 2019

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,160
the world health organization

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,200
reclassified burnout as a legitimate

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,000
diagnosis

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,320
the myoclinic has a list of symptoms

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,880
which

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,600
include number one physical illness like

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,440
fatigue

00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,079
and high blood pressure we don't want

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:51,680
that psychological distress including

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:53,440
sadness irritability anger and rage i

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,880
like our little symbols for that

00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,200
even though these are not good things

00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,279
and of course lastly increase sick days

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,760
and visits to emergency room

00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:02,399
these symptoms add up and have real

00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,160
world

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,480
ramifications in addition to their

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,240
impact on our work and our personal

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,480
lives

00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,680
harvard business school found in 2015

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,320
that workplace stress

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,920
contributes up to eight percent of the

00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,360
national spending on health care

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,040
if you don't happen to know how much

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,399
national spending on health care was in

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,399
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,560
it's about 190 billion dollars

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,399
the biggest factor in these costs high

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,360
demands at work which accounted for

00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,360
about 48 billion in spending furthermore

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,920
approximately 120

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,480
000 people die each year of stress at

00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,160
work that's horrible we do not want that

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,160
now we want to make it clear that stress

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,160
and burnout are not the same thing

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,279
stress is one of the factors that can

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,440
lead to burnout

00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,880
however it's clear that stress and those

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,040
who succumb to burnout

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,800
results in costs to directly impact the

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,959
bottom line of companies

00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,079
given the cost of stress and burnout

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,399
it's not supposed

00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,079
surprising that it's a problem that a

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,440
lot of people try to solve

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,440
and one will go over some of those

00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,519
common solutions next

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,480
well when you think about the cost of

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,480
burnout right

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,320
billions of dollars and so many people

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,079
who have died because of burnout

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,079
you almost when there's this talk about

00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,560
burnout or about thanos

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,160
well the fact is that because burnout is

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,560
such a common problem

00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,839
many people both as a set of

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,680
corporations and as

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,920
individuals have tried to solve the

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,000
problem and we found in our research

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,320
that these problems are fairly common

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,760
but

00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,440
they often come up short so we're going

00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,760
to talk about both uh

00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,600
in the next few slides so let's talk

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,240
about how corporations try to soil

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,920
burnout

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,440
i've been very privileged as someone who

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,000
has worked in technology for over 20

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,320
years

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,399
to have gone to a lot of software

00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,519
development companies i've been

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:48,959
to github in san francisco i've been to

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,519
mailchimp in atlanta i've

00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,000
been to prezi in budapesh and you go

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,200
into these

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,440
offices and they're in these

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,000
magnificently designed buildings with

00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,639
of steel and stone and glass and there's

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,040
often

00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,120
these beautiful break rooms and there's

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,800
foosball tables and you can play table

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,320
tennis and all these amenities

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,639
that are there to help the people who

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,120
work there feel like royalty

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,160
but sometimes royalty winds up at the

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,720
red wedding

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,720
and no matter how plush your office is

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,360
when your team gets to that point

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,160
there's really not a lot that you can do

00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,920
to get them

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,000
out of the damage of stress unless

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,040
you're very intentional about it

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,519
and the reality is that these amenities

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,560
and these techniques are often there

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,920
when times are good

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,680
but when we hit a recession or some

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,920
downturn in the economy

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,800
often these things are the first things

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,120
that get cut

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,480
and so we wanted to create a framework

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,399
that was beyond

00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,240
what corporations would do it had to be

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,399
effective but it had to be

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,360
a way that people without privilege

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,920
could access

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,760
and take hold of these techniques and so

00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,920
uh we want to do something more

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,199
than what we've seen corporations do so

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,399
nick is going to talk about how

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:03,839
individuals

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,839
try to mitigate stress and avoid burnout

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,360
i love this picture of course boots on

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,519
the beach

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,360
i don't know but given the often

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,079
precarious availability of help from

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,760
their companies

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,519
individuals often try to come up with

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,360
their own solutions to burnout

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,199
however people are often bad at

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,800
effectively dealing with stress

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,680
meaning they actually don't solve the

00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,480
problem we often go to excess by abusing

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,560
food drugs alcohol or we turn the

00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,800
escapism by doing things like taking

00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,480
exciting extravagant trips well those

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,959
aren't bad things

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,160
but how many of us actually love to

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,040
practice self-care

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,720
by taking a vacation but with our

00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:44,000
current social media environment

00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,320
even self-care becomes a performance

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,160
people are often unfortunately falling

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,440
off the grand canyon trying to get the

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,519
perfect selfie

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,720
for instagram and snapchat and that

00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:57,920
really defeats the point we're trying to

00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,800
build and reinvigorate ourselves but we

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,279
work to show

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,959
people how much we're not working also

00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,959
escapism usually

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:06,399
requires access to wealth that isn't

00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,279
available to everyone

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,279
in tech or in academia so some people

00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,720
have the funds to go on these trips or

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,240
maybe others do not

00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,399
so corporate efforts are often

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,279
undermined by concerns about the success

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,519
of the business

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,399
and individuals efforts often lack

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,639
efficacy

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,000
and accessibility so the solution to

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,639
burnout has to involve

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,720
simple and effective practices for

00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,800
managing stress

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,120
as we look for a model for addressing

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,639
burnout in tech in other industries

00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,320
we wanted a framework that would be

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,240
effective yet not require

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,160
privilege to access we found a

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,880
three-part plan that we've seen in our

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,240
own lives

00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,240
as well as the lives of software

00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,079
engineers we want this plan to be

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,880
accessible so they are geared around

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,560
practices

00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,800
that individuals can immediately

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,120
implement with very little cost

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,560
however for each part of the model we

00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,160
also have a point or two

00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,920
but what companies can do given the

00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,639
budget and if they have the willingness

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,519
to tackle

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,040
burnout it can't be ignored we have to

00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,720
we have a lot to share about this

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,839
framework but we want to make sure we

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,399
specify

00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,839
clear calls to action so in each part

00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,480
we'll share something we call

00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:14,320
the one thing you simply must do that we

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,720
think are best ways to start burning

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,279
down

00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,880
burn out before we go into our model and

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:19,440
we'll give you some inspiration behind

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,880
it

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,720
right so i'm sure that many of you

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,959
watching this have used a burn down

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,480
chart but just to make sure we're all

00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,639
using the same terminology i'm going to

00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,720
quickly describe what a burn down chart

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,880
is now i'm an engineering manager and

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,399
i've also done work as a scrum master

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,399
and so it really comes from the world of

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,000
agile software development so where burn

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:39,040
down trump works is that you have the

00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,839
horizontal

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,839
axis which is time you have the vertical

00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,880
axis which is work and so the idea is

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,360
that over

00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,800
a period of time this ideal line will

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,800
guide the team

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,880
showing what would happen at the team

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,360
perfectly burn down the work evenly

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,079
over the 10-day period as shown in this

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,000
example

00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,160
and so we have the work and then we see

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,959
that as we do the work

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,160
we'll burn it down and that the work

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,240
left to be done

00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,199
will hopefully become less as we go

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,959
throughout

00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,600
the time period that we're trying to

00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,839
specify in this 10-day cycle

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,959
usually referred to as a sprint and so

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,280
this work

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,720
becomes what we're trying to burn now

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,640
we're trying to burn down the work so

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,640
that by the time we're over

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,079
uh by the time the sprint is over then

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,720
it's down to zero

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,120
now i've used a lot of burn down charts

00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,960
with

00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,320
many teams across multiple companies i'm

00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,559
sure that many of you have

00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,400
seen this some of you may go through it

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:36,480
every day doing your daily stand-up

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,919
but as i worked with burndown charts and

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,400
often worked late at night looking at

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,880
them

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,840
i realized that as an engineering

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,760
manager

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,480
who cares about my team but also as a

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,160
person i had to do more than burn down

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,000
work i realized that there are certain

00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,840
things i needed to burn down

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,280
to deal with the stress that my team was

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,000
under and that was

00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:58,080
really the model uh and really the thing

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
that was the inspiration for this talk

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,840
that we needed to burn down certain

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,400
things just like we burned down

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,679
work uh and that's really how we came up

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,080
with this talk

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,799
and so a lot of what we try to do in

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,520
this toggle

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,559
is be very action-oriented uh to make

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,160
sure that

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,799
everyone can have things that they can

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,960
take even right after this talk is done

00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:21,200
and begin implementing into your daily

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:21,200
life

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,280
burning down barriers i love this

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,039
picture eye contact is so powerful and

00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,640
so meaningful as human beings we want to

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,880
make sure that we have people we look

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,640
them in the eye i know it's difficult

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,320
with all these zoom meetings but just

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,400
that human connection is

00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,080
really important so we all need a

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,280
network of people who will walk through

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,520
our lives with us

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,799
human beings are actually built for

00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,640
relationships that's why when

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,160
unfortunately if someone goes to prison

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,559
one of the worst things that they can do

00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,520
to you is put you in isolations we need

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,840
other people

00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,360
so it becomes cliche but if you want to

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,440
go fast go alone

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,440
but if you want to go far well let's go

00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,600
together in our research into burnout

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,320
we've seen human relationships cited

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,160
as a key way to protect against burnout

00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,080
as members of software development teams

00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,640
it's vital to burn down barriers between

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,640
you

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,320
and the people you work with you should

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,160
also foster an environment of open

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,799
discussion where every team member feels

00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,280
empowered

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,120
to share their ideas even if you're not

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,039
the manager you should also recognize

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,600
good work ideally immediately after it

00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,360
occurs

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,120
however make sure you know how each team

00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,799
member likes to be recognized

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,720
some people may want it done privately

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,559
while others don't mind public praise

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,400
also some prefer written recognition

00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:32,960
while others want it to be said

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,480
verbally there are low-cost ways to

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,120
strengthen your relationships with your

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,520
teams

00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,600
but companies can also help they can

00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,240
incentivize socializing around shared

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,880
interests

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,240
or companies can give out gift cards

00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,559
that can only be used if two

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,080
or three or more people take part in the

00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,559
purchase or the activity

00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,000
so the one thing you simply must do is

00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,240
have regular meetings with people

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,160
in person this can be anywhere like in a

00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,679
coffee shop a restaurant a park

00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,280
but it should be at least once a month

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,520
and with cobia 19

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,960
then of course perhaps a park is a good

00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,760
idea because you can easily kind of

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,280
space out and

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,360
everybody bring their own food that

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,200
would be nice pick the one thing that is

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,039
causing you the most stress in your life

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,640
and share with the people in that group

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,240
while they may not be able to solve the

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,799
problem they can offer support

00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,840
and sympathy and one will cover burning

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,960
down distractions

00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,240
yeah i'm going to cover that i just want

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,480
to linger a little bit here because

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,400
burning down barriers and building up

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,080
relationships is so important i want to

00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,679
share a word for introverts

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,080
if you're introvert like me where you

00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,840
recharge in solitude and

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:34,080
you really can be drained by being

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,520
around people even people like us people

00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,960
who are introverts we need these

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,640
connections we need

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,080
to have someone who's walking through

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,840
life with us so i really want to

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,360
spend time as we go through this first

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,760
part of our three-part

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,440
framework really doubling down on this

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,600
idea that we need to have

00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,919
connections with other humans in order

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,280
to really properly manage stress

00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:55,120
all right the second part of our

00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,039
framework is what we call

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,880
burning down distractions and that's

00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:01,039
harnessing the power of focus

00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,000
to truly get things done you know we

00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,919
live in a world where

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
there's always things distracting us

00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,640
there are notifications on our phones

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,400
and

00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,679
people can contact us in so many ways

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,159
either calling us

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,520
texting us seeing an email walking up

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,799
and talking to us

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,440
and it can be so distracting

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,320
having those interruptions and it really

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,600
blinds us to

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:26,159
the truth that our attention is finite

00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:27,679
we only have so much attention that we

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,919
can spend throughout a day

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,360
and if you're not careful you can not

00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,280
even get to the end of your day

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,880
but have your attention totally drained

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,840
away so that when there's things that

00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,919
come your way

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,679
you don't even have the resources to

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,080
address them and the really

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:42,960
the key to this the key to burning down

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,080
distractions

00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,440
is really the simple power of no we have

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,440
to be willing to tell people

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,440
no that's not something that i can work

00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,840
on right now or even

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,039
to social media no i'm not going to

00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,120
check you right now

00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,440
because i need to harness my attention

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,200
right now every tweet that we read every

00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,360
instagram post that we like

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,240
knicks away and ticks away at our

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,400
attention

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,760
and it's really important to really get

00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,679
to the power of this

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,960
that we have to identify what's really

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,720
valuable to me

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:17,200
what really is important in my life

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,360
and by doing that by really focusing on

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,960
what we think is really valuable

00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,440
that's the way that we can identify

00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:26,240
those things and really get

00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,000
our action and our attention lined up

00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,760
with making a difference in those areas

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,720
so just take some time right now even as

00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,799
you're watching

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,919
this think about what's really valuable

00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,600
to me and

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,960
if you think about it it's probably not

00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,039
20 or 30 things

00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:40,159
even though your task list may be 20 or

00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,400
30 things long

00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,200
there's probably one or two and so we

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,080
really have to do

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,280
the work of narrowing down what are our

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,720
core values

00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,720
and making sure that we give our

00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,360
attention enough space

00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,080
to progress those values and make them

00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,919
real

00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,640
now the one thing that you simply must

00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,559
do to make a real dent is

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,159
to get off social media and i know that

00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,520
that's a lot to say that some people may

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,760
have fallen on your chair

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,320
but yes i recommend getting off of

00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,960
social media but if you can't do that

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,240
at least take a fast from it i recommend

00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,080
at least a month

00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,520
uninstall the social media apps from

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:18,159
your phone and you will be

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,120
amazed at how much of your attention you

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,360
get back

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:24,000
that your attention is not being drained

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,559
by tweets and retweets and comments and

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,200
likes

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,159
but you'll be able to harness that freed

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,919
up attention

00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:33,200
to really make a difference and to

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:35,919
really get the values that you hold dear

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,200
progress and make them real so even if

00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,679
that's not

00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,600
even that's too much right even if a one

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,799
month fast i would say at least put into

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,080
a time box

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:48,000
and say okay only between 10 a.m and 11

00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,919
a.m or whatever hour period works

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,600
i'm gonna get my social media fixed and

00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,559
then i'm not gonna shake it again until

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,559
the next day

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,919
and i'm really trying to simplify it now

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,960
because i really

00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,600
think people underestimate how much we

00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,200
lose out

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,559
by always being on social media so

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,279
that's one thing that i really encourage

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:07,120
you to do

00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,120
in order to get your attention back

00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:13,840
yoga love that i know sunrise sunset

00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,640
beautiful so the our next point is

00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,600
burning down

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,559
illness and a focus on health software

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,039
developers are

00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,480
often trade health for productivity

00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,559
productive people do

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,679
but this often results in a future loss

00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,159
of productivity that

00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,960
outweighs whatever was temporarily

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,760
gained

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:34,240
burnout takes a physical toll on our

00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,240
bodies on our mental and physical health

00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,080
but if we improve our health then we can

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,799
build up resistance the effects of

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,120
burnout

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,720
this includes getting adequate sleep and

00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,559
staying hydrated throughout the day

00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,720
especially in texas where we live

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,000
we have to make sure we we have that

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,799
water and that we're taking care of

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,880
ourselves

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,200
it's also important to get regular

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,720
exercise and improve our nutrition

00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,640
companies can contribute to the health

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,360
of their employees by doing yoga in the

00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,520
office

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,720
paying for gym memberships and giving

00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,200
people mandatory

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,279
no work times each week these no work

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,200
time shouldn't come from their vacation

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,039
and while they don't have to go to the

00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,720
gym they should be encouraged to do so

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,520
so i like the network times where we

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,240
might say

00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,880
from six to nine you know no emails no

00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,600
no phone

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,640
no work just you know engage focus time

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,720
with the family

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,760
so the one thing you simply must do take

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,679
walks

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,440
working out often requires a fair amount

00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,480
of privilege to get access to weights

00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,320
and gym equipment

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,240
working out can be time consuming but

00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:32,880
most of us can take a walk and for me

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,520
when i was doing my um dissertation at

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,679
texas a

00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,960
m university pursuing my phd and i got

00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,720
really really stressed because i want to

00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,039
do such a good job

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,000
i started implementing walks out in the

00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,360
evenings and it's just

00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,760
a part of our life and everyone and i

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,080
walk together almost every single day

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,400
so we can start small walk around the

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,159
block once a day maybe after dinner

00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,919
walking is free it's a simple way to

00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,559
invest in your health and burn down

00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,080
illness

00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:58,159
we've covered a lot and everyone will

00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,360
talk about how to balance everything out

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:00,799
you know i just want to go back to this

00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,480
burn down chart because one of my

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,880
favorite features of a burn down chart

00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,080
is this ideal line right it represents

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,120
perfection

00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,720
but i don't want people to get

00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,840
bogged down by perfection you might be

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,279
thinking okay this is a three-part

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,760
framework it's really simple

00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,880
it's my relationships it's my focus and

00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,799
it's my health

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,559
but even though this framework is really

00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,640
simple and we believe it's powerful

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,159
you can get burned out worrying about

00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,880
burnout and we don't want that to happen

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,880
to you

00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,480
and so what this means is that with the

00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,880
with the ideal line

00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,559
one thing i realized having led many

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,960
teams across many sprints

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,000
is that i don't get hung up if the

00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:38,240
outdoor line

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,279
is not where i wanted to be right maybe

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,200
we are a little bit

00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,640
higher than we like to be and we're not

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,279
where we want to be with bernie on the

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,360
work but

00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:47,360
i know that there's a tolerance range

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,159
where i know that my team has time to

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,000
recover

00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,240
before the sprint ends and so there will

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,760
be times in your life where you're not

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,400
perfectly managing the stress in your

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,240
life

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,919
you're not maybe meeting with people the

00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,240
way that you like to or maybe you

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:00,960
skip a couple weeks at the gym or maybe

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,679
you

00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,799
just are binging on social media well

00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,279
that's okay

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:09,600
as long as you take regular intervals

00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:12,240
and regular checkpoints with yourself

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,880
and say okay things are where i want

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,640
them to be

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,320
and i need to make sure that i get back

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,000
into working out or i'm going to take

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,480
those walks that i started doing

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,360
so well for several weeks until i fell

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,960
off and

00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:25,360
it's really key to have those regular

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,080
checkpoints maybe once a week or once a

00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,120
month

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,159
and maybe with a partner to walk through

00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,919
this together

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,360
but you want to have those checkpoints

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,840
and so don't be

00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,360
too worried about not being perfect it's

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,840
really the practices

00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,640
that we're trying to enable you to take

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,640
hold of today

00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,440
so i just want to go into the fact that

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,679
again the practices

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,440
are really what matters and i like this

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:54,000
picture because it shows that this

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,520
these rocks are balanced and it's really

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,840
a balancing act

00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,440
uh you won't ever be able to balance the

00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,360
stretches in your life

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,640
but that shouldn't be your goal your

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,240
goal should be to know

00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:08,960
when am i outside of my stress tolerance

00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,679
when am i outside of this three-part

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,520
framework

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,840
and that and that you really make space

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,000
and time to get back on track

00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,760
and so again those regular check-ins are

00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,679
really so so important

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,520
and you don't have to perfectly manage

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,600
the stress that you have in your life

00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:25,279
uh you have to be committed to regular

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,480
practices that protect your

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:30,640
relationships

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:33,840
your attention and your health

00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,120
now um i have a couple of things that we

00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,039
put together and i think and i'm going

00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,640
to go through these and that's me

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:40,559
and that's really what you do when there

00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,559
are scarce resources y'all

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,760
and juan and nika it's great that you've

00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:46,799
shared with us

00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,840
these three-part framework items and yep

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,320
i can see how

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,520
they are actionable but what do we do

00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,440
when i don't have

00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,559
even enough to do that and so we have a

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,520
couple of slides

00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,760
i'm gonna go through the first two

00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,559
 gonna do the last one going

00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:03,520
through this framework what can we do

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,159
to really put boots on the ground and

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,200
make

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,399
progress so you might be saying hey

00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,240
and again i mentioned this i'm an

00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,279
introvert or i just don't have access to

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,880
a lot of people

00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:15,200
maybe i live in the area where i don't

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,399
really feel safe going out and meeting

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,039
with people

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,640
at a coffee shop or something well if

00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:23,279
you're an introvert or if you don't have

00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,399
easy access to people one simple thing

00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:26,000
that you can do

00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,840
if you have scarcity of people around

00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,240
you is to volunteer

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,840
and that means that you find a cause

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,120
that really speaks to you that makes

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,120
your heart sing

00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,159
and then you find those like-minded

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,120
individuals

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:41,039
who are organizing to make that cause a

00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,000
reality and you can usually find these

00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,799
online

00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,679
or maybe if you do have in your local

00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,640
neighborhood

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,840
access but i highly recommend joining

00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,480
this group and a lot of groups are

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,320
meeting

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,000
virtually where you can even not have to

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,760
leave your house and you can still

00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,159
take part you can take part in planning

00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,240
you can take part in brainstorming how

00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,000
you can make this call something uh that

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,840
becomes real and that you move forward

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,399
and i know that when i've been able to

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,320
volunteer and be able to engage in the

00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,600
community then you get the sense of

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,399
belonging to something bigger than

00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,000
yourself

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,520
uh and then not only that but then you

00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,240
can connect with people who are also

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,960
engaged

00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,799
in making that cause a reality and so

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,200
that can be extremely empowering

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,000
uh as something to do so if you can't do

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,000
anything

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
get involved volunteering is a way to

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,919
almost get automatic relationships

00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,279
where you know that you have a shared

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:30,880
interest with a group of people

00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,720
all right so that's the first thing i

00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,840
think can put things where

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,279
you can pick it up now you may think

00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:39,600
well yeah i understand

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,880
that my attention is finite and you talk

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,159
about social media you know i don't

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,039
really have a social media account

00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:44,880
because i

00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,159
stayed off that train a long time ago

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,960
well good for you

00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:50,080
but i think that one simple thing that

00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,000
you can do

00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:53,600
even if you have scarce resource is just

00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,520
journal and that's getting a pen

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,360
and getting a paper a piece of paper or

00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,399
a notebook and just writing down what's

00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,080
happening to you

00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,760
and i really do recommend that you don't

00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,799
type it out on your phone or using a

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,120
computer keyboard

00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,240
but you actually write because that the

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,640
the active writing

00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,600
actually reinforces memory and it helps

00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,960
you to

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,880
really feel that you're getting things

00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,360
out because one of the biggest things

00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,679
that

00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,399
i really enjoyed when i started

00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,919
journaling

00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:19,760
is getting things out of my head right

00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:21,919
there's just so many times when

00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:23,519
i have a lot in my head and if i write

00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:25,279
it down then i don't have to be

00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,880
afraid that i'm gonna lose it and that's

00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:29,600
a powerful aspect

00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,640
of journaling but one other aspect of

00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,200
journaling that

00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,399
is really part of how this practice is

00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,399
so powerful

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,840
is that i've gone back to journals i

00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,039
wrote years ago

00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,919
and i look at the things that were

00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,360
bothering me bothering me back then

00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,960
and i don't even really care about those

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:46,799
things like that didn't even

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,559
become a problem or that was a lot

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,960
bigger than i thought it would be

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,399
and by looking back on my past journal

00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,320
entries about my pain

00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,960
that gives me hope that my current pain

00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:59,200
will one day be as irrelevant that

00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,120
i can see that this is going to be

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,159
something that will be worked out and so

00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,600
by having

00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:06,320
that almost literal physical backup of

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,080
your brain

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,760
in the form of journals gives you

00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,399
perspective on what's happening to you

00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,080
today

00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:13,919
and i think it's going to talk about the

00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,480
simplicity the simple thing that you can

00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,679
do

00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,679
to take care of your health

00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,519
well we have a big yellow screen here

00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,320
reminds me of big bird and a person

00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,320
walking

00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,240
um so we're gonna drill down on that a

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,279
little bit so taking walks like we

00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,039
talked about

00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:32,640
um and some of you are thinking that

00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,480
walks aren't enough

00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,080
you have to work out and i agree with

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,760
that and i'm with that

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:39,600
and i agree that working out is crucial

00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,440
for good health um but it can be

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,360
intimidating you know do i use free

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,399
weights or use machines or do i stretch

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,600
before or after

00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:49,360
do i do highways do i do low reps it's

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,640
also easy to get distracted what's the

00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,799
first thing most of us

00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,720
do when we decide to start working out

00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,399
we might buy workout clothes or

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,720
i can't tell you how many times um

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,640
people have purchased new shorts or

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:02,080
new shirts or workout gloves and all

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,799
kinds of gear when they say oh i'm going

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,480
to start

00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,320
working out and then all that stuff

00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,919
unfortunately sometimes goes down to the

00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,519
bottom of the drawer

00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,279
after a few weeks i've never been able

00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:12,640
to have the time or find the time or

00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,320
make the time to work out

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,159
and so the cycle continues when i start

00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,039
working out again and buying new clothes

00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,720
and so forth

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,159
so working out often requires a fair

00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,240
amount of privilege to gain

00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,200
access to weights especially equipment

00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,799
especially during

00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,720
copenhagen where a lot of gyms are

00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:29,039
closing down so let's just keep it

00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,720
simple again we really want to encourage

00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,559
something that's simple and easy and

00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,399
that's taking walks now you need

00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,919
clothes to walk outside of course but

00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,480
you don't need to buy new workout

00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,320
clothes

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,600
we want to start small so you might want

00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,519
to just walk around

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,960
the block you know maybe once a day

00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,720
after dinner it's free

00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,080
and it's a simple way to invest in your

00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,919
health and burn down illness

00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,600
so as software developers most of you

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,240
have used a burn down chart to track

00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,159
your work

00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,840
so you already have this great metaphor

00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,279
for managing stress and avoiding the

00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:58,799
dangers of burnout

00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,640
if you use what we shared with you to

00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:02,880
protect your hearts

00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:05,120
minds and bodies you'll be more

00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,640
productive and model better behavior for

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,480
your colleagues at work

00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,839
as well as the people in your personal

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,839
people you live with

00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:13,839
building software requires motivated

00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:16,240
individuals and reaching out

00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,960
removing distractions and revitalizing

00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,879
yourself

00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,800
will improve what you can deliver to

00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:22,399
your company as well as to your end

00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,960
users and your stakeholders

00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:26,320
and one and i believe that healthy teams

00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,320
make healthy code

00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,399
and burning down burnout will help you

00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,399
be a healthy member of your team

00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,399
so we'll be rooting for you as you burn

00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,159
down the stressors in your life

00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:38,079
so that you can be the best version of

00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:40,879
yourself at work and also

talk that was really great

00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,800
um and i know it's definitely you know

00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,320
applicable generally in tech but i

00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,560
definitely feel like especially after

00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,880
everything this year um

00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,359
you know there's a lot of burnt out just

00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:25,119
from even day-to-day life let alone work

00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:29,440
so um thank you both uh

00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:30,880
are they here i know they're here but

00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,680
i just want to make sure their video

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,680
still comes up

00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,320
hello we are here here we go there we go

00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,240
okay

00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,240
we could not unmute ourselves but uh

00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,880
we're here yeah we are hello everyone

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:46,400
hello

00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,359
hello um so thank you for joining us for

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,400
our q a

00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:52,640
um so one of the things i wanted to ask

00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,560
is i know i heard a lot of your

00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,800
suggestions on getting off social media

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,240
and you know one things i heard a lot is

00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,160
quit watching the news because it's

00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,079
incredibly stressful you mentioned

00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:04,160
a couple times going for walks do you

00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,839
have suggestions on how to remember to

00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,400
engage in these because i know sometimes

00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,000
like i

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,560
i should go for a walk but you know

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,160
after a week i tend to just forget to do

00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,200
it so sometimes things like this fall

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,880
through the cracks

00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,359
well i mean one thing for us is we

00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,040
actually overuse our phones probably we

00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,720
put a reminder in our phone you know

00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,040
after dinner seven o'clock

00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,720
go for a walk um we encourage one

00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,520
another so if you have a neighbor or

00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,040
friend that

00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,440
you know lives near you if you can go

00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,040
walking with them um that would be good

00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,720
and kind of um decompress

00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,160
and share your day with one another i

00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,760
think it's a good thing yeah

00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,599
absolutely i think that after a while

00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,680
once you put the practices in place

00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,040
they become habits and you won't even

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,960
need the phone because you're getting

00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,520
the benefits

00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,240
yeah definitely um i also love that you

00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,800
mentioned

00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,640
uh volunteering and i know i've had some

00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,440
friends that wonder why i'm

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,040
always involved in some volunteer type

00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,440
of activity all the time

00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,880
but i know you anwan had said when you

00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,320
volunteer helps you feel great it helps

00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,000
you gain relationships

00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,560
um do you have any good suggestions on

00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,440
how to find a group or a non-profit

00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,119
or some other way to get involved with a

00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,280
group like that

00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,320
yeah a lot of them are you know are

00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,880
again if you're

00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,240
have a faith base a link uh that you can

00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,480
find a probably a

00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:20,400
a synagogue or a mosque or a church in

00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,480
your area if you're that inclined

00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,079
that's a great way to get involved uh

00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,280
but you know there's a lot of great

00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:29,280
technology groups i'm a big fan of black

00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,480
girls code which is a very

00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,960
mission driven group they're a

00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,960
non-profit and uh they always like

00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,359
people to donate equipment target

00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,800
mentor and they're utilizing zoom and

00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:41,599
other things like that

00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,520
and so um i think looking for

00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,079
non-profits in the tech space because

00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:46,160
we're all

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,280
i think affiliate with technology that's

00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,400
a great way to find a group to get

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,200
involved with and probably find

00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,079
something that's aligned with what

00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,839
you're really passionate

00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,599
about yeah and then maybe after and

00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:55,200
before covett i know i used to also do a

00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:56,000
lot of volunteering for habitat for

00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,839
humanity

00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,240
you know just when you help other people

00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:02,079
you just take the focus all the

00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,599
ruminating that we may do you think

00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,400
about other things and it just really

00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,359
promotes

00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,960
uh mental health for me it does yeah and

00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:11,200
i volunteered with the

00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,640
all-girls robotics team and since

00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,920
they're not meeting in person they can't

00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,520
really build robots but they've been

00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,040
trying to schedule all these things over

00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,960
zoom and with other things so it's kind

00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,400
of cool that still the volunteering

00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,320
opportunities have

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,920
kind of popped up through that um

00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,839
somebody had asked how do you suggest

00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,480
talking to your company about ways they

00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:28,320
can

00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,400
the company itself can help alleviate

00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,960
the burnout

00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,640
you want to take that one um well i mean

00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,480
one thing that's really important i mean

00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:38,079
i've been reading brene brown's um

00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,839
dare to lead and you know just having

00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,280
the uncomfortable conversations it may

00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,880
not be uncomfortable for some people

00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,920
really all depends on the culture of the

00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,520
organization

00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,920
but if you have that psychological

00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,760
safety with your um peers and with your

00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,920
subordinates then i feel that

00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,200
um sharing something like that hopefully

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,760
should be palatable

00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,599
and to be received but basically just

00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,640
like we believe that healthy teams build

00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,400
healthy code

00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,400
you know it takes healthy people to be

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,280
involved and to be productive and so

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,359
it's not that

00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,560
they're losing anything by investing in

00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:08,880
the health of their

00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:10,480
um employees or their team members it's

00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,280
you're actually investing in them so

00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,880
they can have

00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:14,720
be all they can be for themselves as

00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,920
well as for you and one

00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,160
yeah i mean i've been an enterprise

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,480
software development enterprise software

00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,880
development for uh for a very long time

00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,400
um and just like you should not feel shy

00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,280
about asking your manager about a hey i

00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,079
need more ram

00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,720
or i need a faster computer to do my job

00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,720
um

00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,720
taking consideration for your human body

00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,560
is part of doing your job

00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,160
and the ability to present the best

00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,640
version of yourself the most

00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,200
balanced and with stress in the managed

00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,119
state

00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:42,640
that will benefit the company and so i

00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,359
think that just like you would be asking

00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,440
to say

00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:46,720
that the physical tools that i have

00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,720
right now

00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,079
aren't really suitable to me doing my

00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,359
best work you should say

00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:55,520
look i'm i'm managing these items here

00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,800
that will help me bring my best self to

00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,119
work and hopefully

00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,160
if you frame it that way then your boss

00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,119
will see that

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,920
as easy to approve as an upgrade in ram

00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,119
or adding

00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,640
more cpus or an ssd hard drive right but

00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,040
i just want to say i'm just glad that

00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:13,119
you all would even accept or promote

00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,079
um a session like this because we need

00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,079
to normalize

00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,079
health and violence i mean i remember

00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:20,319
when i was a consultant i literally felt

00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:21,040
guilty asking to go have dinner at seven

00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,880
o'clock

00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,599
because they just wanted you to work

00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,760
constantly and i think just normalizing

00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:30,000
we have to eat we have to drink water we

00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,520
have to get enough sleep this is a part

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,359
of the human experience and it seems

00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:34,800
weird saying that but i definitely

00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,720
remember being in a world where i

00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,800
literally felt guilty to just ask for

00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,119
the basic things i needed to

00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,160
be the healthy anika yeah and i

00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,079
definitely agree we

00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,760
we need actually more of these kinds of

00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:46,319
talks in a lot of our conferences and

00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,960
events

00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:50,880
um and in fact i've been trying to watch

00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,920
uh some of the faces on the talk

00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,319
on the call while um reading some of the

00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,440
slack comments and you know so much i

00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:58,880
kept seeing like

00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,720
oh my god i need this talk i need this

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,760
talk i need this talk um

00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,240
so that's been great to see uh another

00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,160
question

00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,760
uh somebody had mentioned that they get

00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,200
a lot of stress from work it's things

00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,480
they can't control like a really high

00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,640
workload

00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,240
management being fairly distrustful of

00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,000
them things like that

00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,240
do you have suggestions on how to start

00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,680
making progress on burnout prevention

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,319
when you can't really

00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:24,079
interact with things like that um i

00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:24,720
think one thing that anyone and i talk a

00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:27,040
lot about

00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:29,280
is we talk about we use i guess

00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,520
timelines a lot so if you were to

00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,880
talk to your manager and you would say

00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,560
these are the things that i have to do

00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,319
then you would say okay these are the 10

00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,920
things that i have to do so in these few

00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,560
days and hours i would do this and i

00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,720
would do this

00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,400
and maybe if you walk them through it

00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:44,880
then maybe they would be able to come to

00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,560
the realization wow it is unrealistic

00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,000
that we're having you do all of this

00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:49,920
maybe we should cut off

00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,160
of these ten things you know eight and

00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,960
nine so it will take some work the

00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,359
framing

00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,680
um always um you know address people

00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,319
with um dignity and respect but i'm sure

00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,920
everyone

00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:03,680
um will but unless you let people know

00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:05,200
um what you're feeling in in going

00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:07,040
through they may not know

00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,800
and you know an old adage that we hear

00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,520
is that you know the squeaky wheel gets

00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,640
the oil

00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:14,720
i mean that that sounds kind of you know

00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,079
bizarre but it's the truth if you don't

00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:18,400
say it then they don't know

00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,160
and so we've got to and i remember as a

00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,720
consultant i i had to

00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,359
you know get strong within myself and

00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,119
say hey

00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:27,040
you know i you know i have to go eat

00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:29,280
dinner you know and not ask and just

00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:31,200
kind of like say it and it seems weird

00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,520
but a lot of the it depends on where you

00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:35,200
work in the culture of the organization

00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:36,720
where um those things get those

00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,160
conversations could be easier to have

00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,079
than others and one

00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,079
i think all that's good i think that if

00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:44,400
possible um

00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,359
well before i say this your essential

00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:47,119
humanity

00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:48,560
uh and being treated with dignity and

00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:49,440
respect is not something that you should

00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,200
have to ask for

00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,200
right that's something that as a human

00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,839
being you should get uh the reality is

00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,640
that we live

00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:57,200
in a capitalist society uh where often

00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,680
people

00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,119
are see are treated and viewed as simple

00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,839
resources and that's the unfortunate

00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,920
reality

00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:05,599
of where we where we live but what you

00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,160
can do is hopefully use that to you

00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:09,359
your advantage uh in the ideal world

00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,319
you'll have a track record of

00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:12,880
performance

00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:14,160
uh that is showing that you are a value

00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:15,920
to the organization

00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,839
and you can hopefully leverage that

00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,400
track record before you hit that burnout

00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:21,359
state

00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:23,119
and say look you know for me to continue

00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:24,000
doing these things and delivering at

00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,160
this level

00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,520
uh and meeting the things that you want

00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,119
me to do and sometimes you have to

00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,960
appeal to people's egos

00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,960
uh and so these are things that i need

00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,040
these are the accommodations

00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:36,400
uh that i need to continue to be this

00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,240
person for you

00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,000
uh and often if you have that track

00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,599
record uh that you've established

00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,680
if you dig your well before you're

00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,880
thirsty then you'll be able to leverage

00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:47,200
that hopefully to get

00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,640
uh some accommodations for what you need

00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,119
absolutely

00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,640
all right thank you both very much for

00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,480

00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,599
questions thank you for having us

yeah thanks everyone enjoy the rest of

00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:09,839
