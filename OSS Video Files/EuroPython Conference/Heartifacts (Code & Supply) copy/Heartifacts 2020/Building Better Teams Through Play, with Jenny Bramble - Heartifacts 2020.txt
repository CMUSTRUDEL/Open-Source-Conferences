Agile teams work incredibly hard to drive software and processes forward. Sometimes we neglect the emotional side of our hard work, leaving teams brittle and less able to adapt and bend. How do we release tension and form the strong bonds that a good team needs to be successful?

As children, we form strong bonds during recess or at play dates. As adults, we lose this sense of companionship and playfulness. Bring it back to your team with targeted fun activities that create a sense of mindfulness, improve skills, and are just downright enjoyable. Team building is the most difficult aspect of leadership--peer or otherwise. One of the best ways to facilitate team building is play!

Jenny will present a method for team building outside of the norm in play time. She will show how events can be arranged, when to do them, and what the benefits are for play time--including stronger teams that work better together due to their powerful relationships between team members.

if you wondered about how teams can be

00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,040
better at connecting

00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,799
and working together while being remote

00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,720
our next talk is for you

00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,400
jenny bramble came up through support

00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,840
and devops cutting her teeth on the

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,719
interesting role that accessed the

00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:15,040
translator

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,480
between customer requests from support

00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,720
in the development team before diving

00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,560
headlong into her career as a tester

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,119
her love of support and the human side

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,199
of problems lets her find a sweet spot

00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,199
between empathy for the user and empathy

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,359
for the team she's done testing

00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,320
support or human interfacing for most of

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,000
her career

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,680
she finds herself happiest when she's

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,280
making an impact on other people

00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,280
whether it's helping find issues in

00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,960
applications speaking at events or just

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:45,840
grabbing coffee and chatting

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,840
here's jenny bramble for her talk

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,960
hi everyone it's jenny bramble here i am

00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,399
so excited to be speaking at artifacts

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,719
i'm going to be talking to you all today

00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,079
about building better agile teams

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,760
through play

00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,440
and you'll have to excuse me my slides

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,640
are actually on my second monitor so

00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,600
occasionally i'm going to glance over

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,600
there super awkwardly

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,080
so one of my favorite things about

00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,760
virtual conferences right now is that

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,040
we're literally stepping into each

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,320
other's homes for

00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,759
a half an hour maybe more and it's a

00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,320
great opportunity to get to know a

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,560
little bit

00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,759
about each other so i'd like to propose

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,840
a scavenger hunt

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,880
now i want you to find something in your

00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,640
house that means something to you and

00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,240
show it to us i'm gonna have a thread

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,880
started on the slack channel

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,840
so pop on over there and post a picture

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,520
of your treasure

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,400
and let me know what it is here's mine

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,240
this is a lyric panel from one of my

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,560
favorite bands

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,680
uh custom made part of a kickstarter

00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,759
very cute

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,520
and it's really special to me because no

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,759
one else has one like it

00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,200
it's also my second favorite song that

00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,920
they've ever done

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,360
so that's super cool all right your turn

00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,479
go drop something in the channel real

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,399
quick so we can talk about it

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,920
so like i said my name is jenny bramble

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,240
uh human interfacing is my

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,399
absolute favorite thing i love it when

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,280
humans and computers talk to each other

00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:10,879
and make magic

00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,400
i love it even more when humans and

00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,319
humans talk to each other

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,160
and make computers make magic that's

00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,200
what this talk's going to be about

00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,879
my pronouns are she and her

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,040
we're going to start out by talking

00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,560
about what is play

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,400
then why do we play and why should we

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,840
bring play back into the workplace

00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,360
specifically

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,280
next we're going to talk about how we

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,200
play and how we start

00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,800
playing and then we're going to have a

00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,560
ton of questions at the end

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,160
don't forget you can post these on slack

00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,840
as the talk is happening

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,440
it is pre-recorded so i won't be able to

00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,920
answer them during the talk but i'll get

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,200
you on slack i promise

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,080
first what is play play is often thought

00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,280
of as an activity

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:56,319
that children do games puzzles recess

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,239
sports things that are incredibly

00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,959
serious to the players but when you look

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,959
at it

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,000
it's a little silly overall maybe even

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,480
ridiculous

00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,519
i'm talking dress up role play matching

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,239
colored squares

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,519
painting these are all playful

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,200
activities that can

00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,519
seem a little bit silly when you step

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,440
back and think about them

00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:20,560
and yet play is such an important and

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,720
vital part of our development that when

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,760
unstructured play time isn't present in

00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,879
the child's life

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,519
psychologists are concerned the lack of

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,599
unstructured play time

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,120
makes children score worse on a lot of

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:37,360
different metrics

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,720
so play is obviously important

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,959
the role of playing development

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,080
describes play as an activity that is

00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,560
desired

00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,159
involves an imaginary situation and

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,000
always involves rules

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,400
now if you've ever played tea party with

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,560
a four-year-old you know that last

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,400
piece is a hundred percent true

00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,080
when i talk about play for this talk i

00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,040
want you to think about a team activity

00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,000
that is fun

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,599
collaborative and bonding these three

00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,519
elements need to be present for it to be

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,239
considered play for the purposes of this

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,799
talk

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,480
now there could be other elements here

00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,000
um we're going to talk about

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,519
learning we're going to talk about

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,720
development and testing our social

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,560
hierarchies

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,720
we're going to talk about creation of

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,280
things but for the base definition this

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:25,120
is what i want us to work with

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,720
all right why play well

00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,240
let's look at animals for a moment you

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,160
might notice the cats are my favorite

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,280
animals i have a couple of them dante

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,360
and dax

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,800
animals play to learn skills when you

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,520
have a predator animal

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,639
they start by catching and clawing and

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,320
chasing

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:46,320
prey animals they run they hide they

00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,240
try to escape when my cats play they

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,800
actually play fight a lot

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,919
dante the older cat always wins dax the

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,040
younger cat

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:57,440
basically never wins that's their social

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,040
hierarchy and this is dax's way of

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,639
testing it and making sure that it's

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,199
still in place

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,680
dax the younger kitten he plays with a

00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:08,000
more variety of toys than dante does and

00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,639
he plays a lot more often

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,039
right now dax is playing and dante's

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,039
asleep

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,960
what i'm getting at here is that those

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,560
who have the most to learn

00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,360
play the most this is one of the reasons

00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,120
that dax

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,960
my younger cat and younger animals in

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,360
general play more

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,000
they are trying to figure out how they

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,440
survive in the world how they thrive

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,759
how they can do the things that they

00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,720
need to do to be successful animals

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,080
you'll see children do this well they

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,600
are encouraged to play

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,840
because this is how they experiment with

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,639
their world this is how they have a

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:47,680
safe structure in which to say does this

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,680
work does this is this gainful for me

00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,680
and how they fit into their world is

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,600
also a huge part of play time

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,520
when children role play they are

00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,560
experimenting with different roles they

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,199
can potentially have

00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:03,280
in the real world i personally wanted to

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,639
be a princess unicorn when i roll play

00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,639
i kind of still want to be a princess

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,720
unicorn honestly

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,479
so why did we stop playing if this is so

00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,759
vital to our learning and to our mental

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,960
health and all of this

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,720
why did we stop well

00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,400
it comes there comes a point where

00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,639
unstructured play time doesn't

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,840
serve our needs as well as other things

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,280
that we need to do

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,360
when we start to move into the adult

00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,759
world we leave behind tea parties but we

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,160
grill

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,759
out we stop having recess we have

00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,199
meetings

00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,520
instead of getting together to play

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,400
street hockey we

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,919
go to a pool party these are fun

00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,360
satisfying activities but they're not

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,120
really play

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,000
we do find ways to bring play back into

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,960
our lives board games and video games

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,400
and

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,639
pranks on each other all of this is play

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,160
we still bring it in even though we

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,479
don't really

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,599
talk about it as play when we talk about

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,360
it as play it's

00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,280
seen as diminishing the activities we're

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,479
doing which

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,000
i don't want to diminish them at all

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,960
they're amazing they're wonderful

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,479
they're bonding

00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:08,960
and we need them in our lives

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,240
we should start playing again especially

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,280
at work

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,400
uh i really want to encourage everyone

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,479
to bring play back in

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,599
and i've got three reasons that i want

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,599
to talk to you about here

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,560
and you'll pardon me if i'll drink a

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,560
little something do in the middle

00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,720
play helps those with the most to learn

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,400
play creates and reinforces and lets us

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,840
test the social bonds that we need to

00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,199
operate as a team

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,520
and finally play is good for our

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,240
professional development

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,759
let's start at the top here play helps

00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,120
those with the most to learn now if

00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,800
you're anything like me

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,160
you've been in software for more than a

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,520
hot minute

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,280
i've been in software for a lot of hot

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,240
minutes however many minutes or in 10

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,800
years

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,319
it's been more than that so what do i

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,720
need to learn i'm good at this

00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,360
i can do software i can test i can lead

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:04,560
people

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,560
i'm fine right well about that

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,919
this is the storm forming storming

00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,400
normally performing

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,599
model of teamwork and what it says is

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,440
that

00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,879
the first phase of a team coming

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,319
together is essentially someone who has

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,919
a bucket and they pour a bunch of humans

00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,680
in it and they say ah

00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,440
ta-da a team this leads us into the

00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,440
storming phase where the team is trying

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,520
to figure out how they work together

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,560
it's still a collection of individuals

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,240
in a bucket

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,080
they haven't learned enough about each

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:35,360
other to really start to

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,519
be a strong team that takes us to the

00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,440
norming phase we're no longer arguing as

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,839
much we're starting to understand

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,760
our roles as individuals in the team how

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,040
we communicate how we talk to each other

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,360
how we work together

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,720
and we start to form the bonds that we

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,040
really need to be a

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,040
well-performing team which leads us to

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,080
the performing things

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,800
now this is really interesting because

00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,800
what gets us

00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,839
out of storming and into norming and

00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,760
into performing is

00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,959
learning about each other finding out

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,800
how we operate

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,560
having discussions about our

00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,480
communication this is what gets us out

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,320
of those phases

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,320
play is an amazing way of

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,839
short-circuiting long-storming and

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,399
norming phases

00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,360
and building a better team faster and

00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:21,120
stronger in the end

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,880
play helps those with the most to learn

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,640
when we're forming a team and when we're

00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,120
on a team we need to learn about each

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,839
other

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,320
so that we can actually become a team

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,440
and be

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,760
something that works well together play

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,839
helps us do this in a psychologically

00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,839
safe manner

00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,240
i want to talk about a couple of games

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,320
really quickly particularly some social

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,240
deduction games

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,440
one night werewolf is my favorite kind

00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,839
of team bonding

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,480
social deduction game i have a couple of

00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,240
others

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,000
honestly y'all i have a list i will give

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,440
you the list i promise

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,440
um in this game everybody has a role

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,399
uh you've got the werewolves the

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,839
werewolves are trying to eat the

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,279
villagers the villagers are trying not

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,959
to get eaten by the werewolves

00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,480
you have a seer who can look at someone

00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,320
else's cards

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,519
you have a minion who's working on the

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,800
side of the werewolf

00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,560
making sure nobody knows who the

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,959
werewolf is and you've got the

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,040
troublemaker which is my favorite card

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,040
if you've ever met me in real life

00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,440
you're probably going ah

00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,160
yes it is she's essentially an agent of

00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,839
chaos she can switch two cards at random

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,200
so that if you were a werewolf and you

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,040
thought you were a werewolf

00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,560
now you're a tanner and you're on the

00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,200
village team it's just a little bit of

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,640
chaos

00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,240
she doesn't have any discreet knowledge

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,600
of the game herself

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,279
she just causes trouble what's

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,640
really interesting about social

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,240
deduction games and this one in

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,519
particular

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,760
is that it creates an artificial

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,000
hierarchy it creates a world that you

00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,120
need to operate in and it creates a task

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,399
that you need to do

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,480
you need to work with the other people

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,040
on your team without knowing exactly who

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,760
your team

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,600
is to get to the bottom of this this

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,680
mystery

00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,440
it's fun it's interesting it's

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,600
collaborative it's bonding

00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,200
you will learn so much about conflict

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,360
resolution within your team by playing a

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,440
couple of rounds of one-night werewolf

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,279
because it is setting you up to be in

00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,360
conflict it is setting you up to say

00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,320
i think that my boss is a werewolf and

00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,640
he's trying to eat me

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,399
and you see how your boss reacts to that

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,279
you see how someone reacts when they're

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,320
challenged

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,640
potentially incorrectly challenged how

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,240
is that conflict resolved

00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,000
how do we feel about each other

00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,959
afterwards

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,800
this is so interesting from a team

00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:39,200
bonding

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,160
viewpoint because we need our social

00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,800
hierarchy

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,320
but we also need to be able to challenge

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,079
our social hierarchy

00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,760
i need to be able to go to my boss and

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,160
say man i don't think this is working

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,240
out

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,120
or jeez i have a better idea can we try

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,959
it

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,800
having a framework that is

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,800
psychologically safe for me to make

00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,680
these challenges to practice these

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,800
challenges is

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,639
really important there's not a lot of

00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,079
chances to practice

00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:10,240
giving someone bad news or telling them

00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:13,920
something that they may not like

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,200
games provide us that area to practice

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,079
in

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,680
you have tools to start exploring start

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,160
looking at the social hierarchy that

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,160
you've got

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,160
plate also creates and reinforces these

00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,720
social bonds

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,399
whenever we are playing whenever we are

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,440
doing something collaborative

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,279
we are part of a unit think about when

00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,240
you were a kid you had a code word to a

00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,240
tree house

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,079
you had a secret handshake maybe you had

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,920
a secret hand sign that you did with

00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,680
your friends

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,519
all of these things are something that

00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:51,120
make us a team to make us bond better

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,880
and these collected experiences

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,800
start to become an oral history and a

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,639
tradition of the team

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,560
you'll start to see long-lived teams

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,160
actually have an oral tradition that's

00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:03,360
passed down to newer members

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,800
as an initiation almost i'm not going to

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,160
dive into this too deeply right now

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,680
because i'm going to dive into it really

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,160
deeply in a minute

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,079
um but i'm glad to talk about it

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,519
afterwards so hit me up on slack put

00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,040
some questions in the channel it's gonna

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,079
be great

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,959
play is also good for your professional

00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:21,040
development

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,120
oh man so i'm a tester i'm a test

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,519
engineer i i

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,800
hate saying i break software i make sure

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,800
the software performs to the

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,880
expectations we have

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:36,240
and a lot of that is actually

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:39,680
problem solving creating narratives

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,720
logic puzzles these things can't really

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:46,560
be practiced outside of real life

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,000
or in games games that create narratives

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,600
help me create a narrative

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,959
of a story of a jira story not an actual

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,959
story

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,639
maybe an actual story but it helps me

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,320
create a narrative and say okay this is

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,360
how my user moves to the flow

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,000
this is why this is important

00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,279
much like testing our social bonds games

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,199
actually give us a

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,720
framework in which to test our

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,560
professional development

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,959
and figure out what we know and how to

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,480
practice it i'm gonna hit this also a

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,560
little bit later

00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,920
and uh probably excruciating details

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,199
it's one of my favorite parts of this

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,639
talk

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:24,160
so how do we play i'm gonna talk about

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,519
three things i know there's four things

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,279
on the list but i'm not gonna

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,279
talk about team outings and happy hours

00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:32,160
right now because

00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,839
a lot of us don't have those so i'll

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,120
revisit this talk when the pandemic is

00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,160
over i promise

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,279
we're going to talk about agile

00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,560
ceremonies we're going to talk about

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,000
wolf time we're going to talk about

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,360
learning play

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,680
so from the top i have a question

00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,959
and answer this one in slack how do you

00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,800
end your stand-ups

00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,160
what do you do when everybody's given

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,440
their report

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,839
uh do you have something you do or do

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,440
you just sort of wander off back to your

00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,720
own little bubble

00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,320
ask this question at work and i know

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,000
this slide is really small

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,440
don't worry slides will be provided at

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,639
the end

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:10,480
i got so many answers

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:12,240
they ranged from silly to outright

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,120
ridiculous quite honestly

00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,399
a lot of teams do a clap some teams do

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:19,440
snaps

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:22,639
a couple of teams do a wave thing i do

00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,480
uh clapping for my team

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,720
there were some really fun ones like

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,240
shouting a random word of the day

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,480
and this is where it gets interesting

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,079
because a lot of different teams have

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,880
something relating to a random word of

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,040
the day

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,199
it turns out there was one person in the

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,079
company who really liked that as part of

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,399
stand up

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,839
and you could almost trace how he moved

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,480
around the company

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,079
by which teams had a random word of the

00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,440
day

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,360
again this starts to become our oral

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,360
history our tradition

00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,880
it's a history now not only of my team

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,639
but also of my company

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,959
everyone who has the same stand-up

00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,279
ritual

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,120
is part of the same team the same larger

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,199
team

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,759
these are all forms of play this is a

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:08,000
way to bring that levity in to bring in

00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,199
that idea of doing something

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,639
collaborative

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:16,079
bonding fun find it very exciting

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,279
having a team tradition for ending

00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:21,839
ceremonies is a form of play

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:24,240
this is like a jump rope when you're a

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,079
kid or the clap thing

00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,639
it is a form of play it is collaborative

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,079
it is bonding it is fun

00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,560
generally it's fun sometimes they're

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,160
very complicated and confusing

00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,639
so the next thing i want to talk about

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,920
is wolf time

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,360
no wait let me talk about flow time

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,240
first it'll make a lot more sense in a

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,480
few minutes

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,839
so flow is being in the zone it's that

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,880
moment where you're like ah

00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:49,600
yes i could do this forever i am in a

00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,480
perfect state of concentration

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,920
everything is

00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,600
beautiful colors are brighter i am so

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,000
enjoying this activity that i'm doing

00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,759
and i'm making so much headway on it

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,120
this is something you want to really

00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,880
optimize for

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,480
if you're trying to get the most out of

00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,360
your day

00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:09,600
so what's wolf time then well if you

00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,720
take flow time and you reverse it

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:15,039
you got wolf time uh

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,120
i can't take credit for this but i will

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,720
say it more times than is probably

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,280
necessary

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,880
wolf time is the idea that you are

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,400
taking time away from work to do

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,600
something collaborative something

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,679
fun something relaxing hopefully

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,000
uh i did find out that playing giant

00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:35,200
jenga is not a relaxing activity for me

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,640
which is fine uh this is a time that we

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,799
are not necessarily working

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,559
as a team but we are doing something

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,120
that's building the social bonds of our

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,840
team

00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,280
that's helping us to be a better team

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,120
even if it doesn't look like we're

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,240
actually working

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,240
actually uh it's actually become so

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,760
important at my job that we talk about

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,120
it when teams are first forming we talk

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,480
about okay so so

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,160
when are we doing what time who's gonna

00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,720
be in charge

00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,799
all right what does wolf time look like

00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,520
it is semi-structured

00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,440
it's very regular uh in general i like

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,039
once a sprint some people like once a

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,400
week

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,240
i think once a week is a little bit too

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,039
often but you know your team will may be

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,320
different

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:18,240
it's at least once a month limited to an

00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,440
hour or less and generally you want this

00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,799
during work hours

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,960
so it feels like people are taking a

00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,960
break taking a breather

00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:27,520
put someone in charge of arranging it if

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,840
you just leave it up to the

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,960
the void to kind of figure it out no one

00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,320
will do it

00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,240
so make sure you've got someone in

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,559
charge

00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,559
again i asked the question uh at work

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,080
what do you do for wolf time and i know

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,160
this slides a little small so

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,000
i'll read you off a couple uh my one of

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,080
my favorites my second favorite

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,440
is actually i had a team member who

00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,280
hadn't seen the movie

00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:53,520
alien so we booked a conference room

00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,360
and we did team lunch that day so we

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:57,600
actually did this two weeks in a row

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,440
we watched an hour of alien and eight

00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:03,280
team lunch and then we watched another

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,960
alien later uh the next week at 18 lunch

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,440
uh and if you haven't seen alien in a

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,640
while it is a wonderful

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:12,400
slightly terrifying movie uh

00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,000
that's made even better when you start

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,799
being like jonesy

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,960
where's the cat don't go down that

00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,799
hallway

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,320
it's a lot of fun and we were able to

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,720
talk about this for

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,679
four weeks afterwards and occasionally

00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,880
someone would peak their head in the

00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,480
conference room they're like

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,559
you're watching a movie you'll be like

00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,440
yeah you want to sit in

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,960
so much fun uh another team to logos

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,760
sculptures

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,440
um roll d and d characters make sushi

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,960
together

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,799
i know there's a lot of people that are

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,799
not in the office right now and maybe

00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,400
you've never been in the office so

00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,400
there's virtual ways to do this

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,000
i have another list i will totally

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,400
provide it y'all

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,440
jack box games are really great drawful

00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,280
2 is amazing

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,440
you can roll dmd characters together and

00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,720
play one shot

00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,840
it might take you a while to get through

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,840
one shot if you only have an hour

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:05,039
when we were in the office one team made

00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,320
gingerbread houses

00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:09,360
and then the rest of the company ate

00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,720
them so it can be it could be a group

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,720
group activity let me talk to you about

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,120
my absolute favorite wolf time that i've

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,559
ever

00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,880
done so to set the scene my team was in

00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:22,559
massive crunch time and

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,000
you know morale was down we were really

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,799
stressed you're starting to get snappy

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,039
in each other

00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,880
you know that kind of moment where you

00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:35,280
feel like the vase is about to

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:36,720
fall off the shelf and you're like

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,520
so i offered to run wolf time for the

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,280
team uh

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,799
i took these little canvases i think

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,440
they're either six by six or eight by

00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,840
eight

00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,320
and i drew our company's logo on them in

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,880
pencil gave

00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,720
everybody a a little square and said

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,200
paint it however you want but you have

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,159
to stay in the lines

00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,400
um i had regular paint metallic paint

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:03,200
glitter paint actual glitter

00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,320
glue i don't know why i had glue in the

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,679
paint containers but

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:12,000
it's fine there was some glue and

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:15,120
we made this crazy awesome picture

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,120
it's so beautiful and it's so weird and

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:21,280
each one of our personalities

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:23,360
kind of pops out when you look at it

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,640
this is something we did we did this

00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,080
together

00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,200
even the people that weren't painting

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:32,240
were being art critics like oh

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:36,080
i see it's blue it was so

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,600
much fun and we came up with this

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,919
beautiful painting that

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,520
hangs in our team's face every time we

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,080
would walk past it we'd be like ah

00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,679
do you remember that time and we had

00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,080
other teams come by and be like wow

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,720
that's

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,799
beautiful even the ceo of our company

00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,400
was like

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:57,360
clever so it not only was

00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,320
a moment for us to breathe and remember

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,520
that we're all

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,600
human and we're all people here

00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:05,200
it's also something that that's lasted

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,679
it's something that we can look at today

00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,880
and say

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,799
i remember doing that with you remember

00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,240
you're a person too

00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,159
and i think that's really important

00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,600
especially in the times that we're in

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,240
now

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,200
we need more space to be human and wolf

00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,200
time gives us that

00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,320
uh like i said i'm going to skip over

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,000
team outings and happy hour

00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,200
they exist they're wonderful we will

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:34,000
have them again someday

00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,000
the next piece i want to talk about is

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,640
learning through play

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,600
so this is one of my favorite things

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,360
ever i love play learning

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,280
i run office hours which is a time for

00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,760
the test engineers in my company to get

00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,760
together

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,679
and talk about test engineering things

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,919
to have these conversations

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,039
to do workshops and sometimes we play

00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,559
games

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,960
what kind of games the test engineers

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:59,200
play well let me show you

00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,840
this is one of my absolute favorite uh

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,320
decks of cards it's called test sphere

00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,679
test for your cards oh look at this my

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,679
expansion pack

00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:13,039
they have a word on them they have a

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:15,280
category so this is

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,080
data which is a quality aspect the

00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,080
definition

00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,200
data moves in through and from your app

00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,760
it can get

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,280
stuck lost scrambled and duplicated how

00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,919
does that affect your testing

00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,080
is is the kind of implied question there

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,919
so

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,280
what i have actually done with this is

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,760
worked with the ministry of tests to

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,919
create

00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,880
a version of test sphere called test

00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,720
sphere arena

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,960
test for arena acts like uno

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,000
and if you look in the corner you can

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,400
see

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,320
i actually did homemade uno cards this

00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,640
one says skipped feelings

00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:51,360
which honestly is an entire 20 20 mood

00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,760
for me the idea is you can play

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:55,360
light colors on light colors if you want

00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,360
to play a different color

00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,720
on a different color then you have to

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,799
say why

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,720
okay so i've got data the quality aspect

00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:06,559
here and i want to play

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:09,039
the feeling indifferent

00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,799
so i would have to explain how data

00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,120
makes me feel a difference

00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:14,480
or how indifferent relates to data and

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,120
what i would say is that

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,159
um if i'm ever really indifferent to

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,919
data

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,840
then what that tells me is i'm not

00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:25,039
paying enough attention to it

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,240
so i'm probably missing something

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,760
and the rest of the people the table

00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,919
would either give me a thumbs up for oh

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,840
yeah that that association makes sense

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,039
or a thumbs down for no that doesn't

00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,400
make sense

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,000
that's too much of a stretch you don't

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,799
get to play that card if you don't get

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,440
to play the card

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,880
it skips you you can also play a skip on

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,559
your friends

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,559
or you can play a flaky tests

00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,679
which makes the next player pick up two

00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,960
parts

00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,480
what you get here is a lot of

00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,120
information about how your co-workers

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,240
think

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,559
how they work and some of the

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,400
experiences they've had

00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,320
you were also reminded about a lot of

00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,000
testing pieces that

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,400
are not necessarily at the top of your

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,799
mind it is incredibly fun

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,279
but you're also accidentally learning at

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:10,159
the same time

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:11,440
um i literally have a list of about 20

00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,559
of those games

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,520
including happiness at work or choose

00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,960
happiness at work

00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,880
which is basically cards against

00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,679
humanity for

00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,120
feelings you play a black card that says

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,840
uh i must work very long

00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,039
hours and then you pick a yellow card

00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:31,200
from your hand

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:34,720
that could be a solution to that uh that

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,080
problem like um breathe as much as

00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,840
possible for four seconds hold that

00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,440
breath in for six seconds exhale for

00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,320
eight seconds does meditation help with

00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,720
that

00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,440
maybe maybe not oh ask a favor do a

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,760
favor

00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,760
that could help me with working long

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,640
hours

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,440
uh yeah so i have tons and tons of games

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,000
like that

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,480
and i will be happy to share them games

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,480
from

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,159
requirements gathering to tech debt to

00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,960
how the software development life cycle

00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,200
works

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,960
soft skills problems there's a game for

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,400
any problem that a team could find

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,320
themselves facing

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,400
and almost every group can find

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,320
something to improve their skills in

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,640
this is another way of testing what i

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:15,600
know can i build a narrative

00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,200
can i make associations with things can

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,919
i make the right choice when i'm asked

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,640
about

00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,640
requirements

00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,200
so i hope i've convinced you to

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,039
that play is really important that

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,320
bringing play into your work life is

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:34,320
going to improve it

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:36,400
so how

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,240
we have another graph coming up y'all

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,559
this is the zone of proximal development

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,480
this is essentially a

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,159
description of how we learn we start

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,240
with what is known and that's something

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,720
i can do completely on my own

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,400
i'm an expert at it i feel good doing it

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,400
i could possibly teach someone else

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,559
for me personally that's cupcakes i'm

00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:57,760
really good at making cupcakes y'all

00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,799
i love them they're the best a skill's

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,240
too difficult to mask

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,840
for someone to master on their own but

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,440
can do it with guidance and

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,080
encouragement from a non-knowledgeable

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,240
person

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,400
is where most of our growth happens this

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,120
is just outside of our comfort zone but

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,720
someone can guide us along here

00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,360
an example for me would be making

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,120
fondant animals or fondant roses

00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,399
i'm not confident enough to do that by

00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,399
myself

00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:21,679
but maybe with a good tutorial youtube

00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,880
video or friend

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,799
i could probably do that pretty easily

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,399
past that is what is not known something

00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,840
that i can't do

00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,840
even if i've got someone super

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,200
knowledgeable guiding me it's just too

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,360
much

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,520
an example would be sugar work i'm kind

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,760
of terrified of hot sugar

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,880
and i would have a really hard time

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,240
working with it

00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,520
even with someone who is very

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,520
knowledgeable leading me along

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,000
when introducing concepts like play time

00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,480
wolf time to our teams

00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,120
we have to be careful not to put it out

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,559
there too

00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:58,159
quickly not to do too much if your team

00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,720
isn't psychologically safe enough to

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,480
play

00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,799
or if you don't have a culture of being

00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:05,840
psychologically safe enough to

00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:07,919
have crazy ideas then

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,440
it can be really hard to get started it

00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,240
can be difficult to say

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,840
y'all this is really gonna help us and

00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,930
have everyone go

00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,080
oh

00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:19,600
[Music]

00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,080
that's an actual reaction i've gotten

00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,080
from people

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,080
and honestly that can and that can

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,840
undermine what you

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,240
are trying to accomplish it can

00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,080
undermine the whole idea of playtime

00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,559
and the idea of building the bonds even

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,559
stronger

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,840
so start small that's my biggest piece

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,440
of advice to everyone is start small

00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,120
look at the culture you've got in your

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,600
company in your team

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,360
in your peer group and think about

00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,399
something that you can bring in really

00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,559
easily

00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,880
a lot of times starting with a stand-up

00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,240
ceremony is a really great place

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,640
because it's a little bit fun it's a

00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,360
little bit silly it takes 10 seconds of

00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,679
maximum and it really gets your day off

00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,120
on

00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:05,600
on the right foot so try that

00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,640
try something like that and gauge the

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,799
response

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,640
if it's a good response then try

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,440
something a little bit more

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,399
out there i would suggest a scavenger

00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,760
hunt

00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:20,559
oh coming full circle i see jenny

00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,960
the idea of the scavenger hunt is to

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,080
start

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,120
personalizing our relationship for me to

00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,919
say to you

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,559
show me something special and for me to

00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,559
say to you

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,600
here is something special this is

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,520
something that means

00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,799
something to me and now you know a

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:38,880
little bit more

00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:42,320
about me how i work how i operate and

00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,320
because we've shared it actually starts

00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,840
making our bond stronger

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,679
when i look at you i'm gonna think about

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,840
that thing and you're gonna think about

00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,720
my weird music maybe you'll even be like

00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,960
so can you send me a link to ghost

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:59,120
feeders song veins

00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,120
i'm like sure it's gonna get weird y'all

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,840
these things are really fun they're

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,760
really great ways to start small

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,600
once you've got that done down and

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,520
people seem to be responding well

00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,720
start talking about an agile learning

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,520
game so

00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,200
test fear if you've got testers um like

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,640
i said i have about a dozen games that i

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,880
can send you

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:21,440
um about the requirements gathering that

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,240
one's really easy to do a resume

00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,799
and start working this in start saying

00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,640
oh

00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,919
we're learning about this we're not

00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,480
we're not just playing

00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:33,200
we're doing work we're learning and from

00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,919
there you can start moving into more

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,200
games like go fish do you want to play

00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,520
rummy online

00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,960
how about a rousing game of settlers of

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:45,200
kadam

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,600
online any play is good

00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,360
any play that we can get into our lives

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,159
into our work lives is going to increase

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,760
our bonds

00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,440
it's going to make us a better stronger

00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,799
team because it makes us better

00:30:53,440 --> 00:31:00,480
stronger people in general

00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:03,039
so to recap play a team bonding and

00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,640
building activity

00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,559
creatures who need to learn the most

00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,240
play the most teams that are not

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:11,519
incredibly psychologically safe

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:15,039
teams that are still super stormy really

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:19,120
need play start small don't try and run

00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:20,880
in with an hour-long session of go fish

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,799
start with something smaller start with

00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,159
something like stand up

00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:27,440
or an agile game and remember any play

00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,240
is healthy

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,399
anything we can get into our teams that

00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,320
increases this bonding that lets us test

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,000
our social hierarchies that lets us test

00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:39,279
our professional development

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:41,360
is so healthy for us and so amazing for

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:43,919
us

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,000
um as i said my name is jenny bramble i

00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,519
hope you've been live tweeting this talk

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,279
hope you've been using the hashtags i

00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,720
hope you're in the slack channel

00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,559
because we're going to have some rousing

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,880
conversation after this

00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,679
this is one of my favorite talks to give

00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,799
because there's

00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:00,720
so much richness to it and so many

00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,159
things we can learn

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,320
all right y'all we are going to be

00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:07,760
switching over to questions now

00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,760
so i hope you've got them ready

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:14,640
so one of our uh artifacts

00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,840
members had said the recent group boot

00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,080
camp graduate

00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,840
with the music performance masters and

00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,840
advocating for play time and some of

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,600
these extras feels really privileged for

00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,080
somebody not used to the tech workplace

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,640
yet

00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,000
how would you advocate for them kind of

00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,440
trying to incorporate this into their

00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,080
workplace

00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,200
first off congratulations huge

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,559
accomplishment

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,480
so proud of you uh second off so

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,559
there are a lot of small steps we can

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,480
take and one of the small steps is

00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,200
starting with like stand up and all of

00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,720
that

00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,039
the what i would suggest for you

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,000
specifically because you've got a music

00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,640
background

00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,279
is there is a really great talk by uh

00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,960
jess

00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,480
and i always mess up her last name i'll

00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,679
shoot it to you on slack

00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,279
um it is about how music and music

00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,919
theory makes us better people

00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,120
and makes us better tech workers and

00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,200
it's it's kind of how

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,360
she learns through music and that can be

00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,120
a way to introduce in something that's

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,080
not necessarily work but can be a little

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,720
bit fun

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,240
and then say okay so i've introduced you

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,559
to some music theory i've started

00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,399
getting some of that in there

00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,840
what's another piece like that we can

00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:21,760
talk about well

00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,440
we know that music helps us and learning

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:26,559
music helps us learn better

00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,600
so let's uh do something silly like

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:30,880
drawing

00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:33,679
a game of drawful 2 has a lot of

00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,679
similarities to learning music and to

00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,519
doing those kinds of activities so that

00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,600
can be a way to really sort of slide it

00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,120
in under the radar

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,120
and i highly recommend it if you want

00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:46,159
more tips and everything hit me up

00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:49,679
and i will find a link to that talk uh

00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:52,240
later today yeah um it sounds like your

00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,000
dog wants to play right at the moment um

00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,279
yeah that's my mom's dog

00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,600
she's not in the house so i can say i

00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,360
don't like it um it's a fine dog he's

00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,519
just loud

00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,679
um do you have recommendations for how

00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:06,240
to introduce people to a more

00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,679
traditional work added or from a more

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,399
traditional work attitude

00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,520
to having wolf time so this is

00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:14,000
absolutely the

00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,839
absolute hardest thing to do when you've

00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,960
got a traditional mindset you've really

00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,200
got that

00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,040
eight hours work work work work work

00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,200
maybe you can take a smoke break

00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,079
but that's it and that can be really

00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,480
hard to sort of

00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,760
break into whenever you've got these

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,879
these quote unquote fun things you want

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,119
to play

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:33,040
i suggest starting with learning games

00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,720
because ah we're not playing we're

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,240
learning y'all

00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,760
and that's another great way to sort of

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,079
sneak this in we say

00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,760
you know we're not sitting down and

00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,440
doing a puzzle we're not sitting down

00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,320
and doing a coloring book page

00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,159
what we're doing is we are refining our

00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,720
ability to gather requirements by

00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,399
playing 99 balloons

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,839
and that can be a really good way to

00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:56,079
start getting a little bit of that in

00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:58,240
there and once the

00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,200
that kind of hardcore starts softening a

00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,720
little bit

00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,560
then you can start talking about other

00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,839
things like okay we've done this

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,880
requirements gathering game it was

00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:08,240
really interesting

00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:10,800
let's do a paint by numbers game uh it's

00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:12,079
sort of the same right and that could be

00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,960
a really good way to really

00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:17,200
bring in the idea of play to a workplace

00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,320
that is a little bit more formalized and

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,920
a little bit less

00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,920
open to those sorts of things yeah

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,680
um and kind of similarly i know i

00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,520
personally am part of a brand new

00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:30,480
engineering department that hasn't had

00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:32,240
developers before um so i'm one of the

00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,599
first two and we're solely bringing in

00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,280
more people over time

00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,280
um do you have good suggestions on how

00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,480
maybe we could build up a great culture

00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,680
from a tiny team

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,079
in the beginning ah

00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:46,000
psychological safety psychological

00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:50,560
safety listening to people

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:52,480
and holding space for people who don't

00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:54,000
want to speak

00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,640
a lot of times we look at teams and

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,079
we're like psychological safety is about

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,480
having room to speak

00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,640
up about having the ability to challenge

00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:06,000
the hierarchies that are in place

00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,040
it's also about being okay with what's

00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,720
happening

00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,320
so i have a lot of friends at work who

00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,240
are very quiet who don't

00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,480
stand up and challenge and i want them

00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,240
to feel safe to be that person

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,160
as much as i want people like me to be

00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,880
like ah fight the man

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,480
or whatever i'm doing at the moment so i

00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,200
would say psychological safety

00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,200
hold space for people and don't overly

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:29,280
pressure people to take advantage of the

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:32,400
space that we're holding

00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,079
yeah um and i guess final question do

00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,400
you have thoughts on how to allocate

00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,160
time for these games especially with

00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,680
work that have either really busy

00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,560
schedules or expect a lot of

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:45,200
expectations on like delivery of you

00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:47,200
know code or whatever

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,400
so that is again a mindset change and a

00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,480
culture change

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,400
if we are in a place where we don't have

00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,079
time to take a break where we don't have

00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,040
time to step away and

00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:59,119
say okay i need to do this i need to

00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,880
take care of myself i need to go

00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:02,160
use the restroom i want to go take a

00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,160
walk around the block

00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,839
if our schedules don't have space for

00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,599
those things in there

00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:09,520
then we've got a culture problem at work

00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:13,359
that we need to start talking about

00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:14,720
we must must must have space to be human

00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:16,160
especially during the pandemic

00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,079
especially with everybody at home and

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,079
their kids at home their dogs at home

00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,839
all of that we need space to be people

00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:37,839
more than ever and we need to work that

00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:37,839
into our schedules

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,560
