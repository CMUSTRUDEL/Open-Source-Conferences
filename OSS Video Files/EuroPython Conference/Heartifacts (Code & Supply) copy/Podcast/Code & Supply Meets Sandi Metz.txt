happy to have you yeah it's very

00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,540
exciting yeah um okay so I guess what

00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,980
we're gonna we'll start with kind of

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,739
like how you got your start in the

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,289
industry um so can you tell us like how

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:51,270
like how you got interested in computers

00:00:49,289 --> 00:00:54,390
and programming specific knowledge ok so

00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:56,579
that was so long ago like I'm not sure

00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,649
that my experience are getting started

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,890
well ok I was going to say I'm not sure

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:04,199
it's of interest or of use to anyone but

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,810
I'll back I'll back up now I gotta look

00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,790
at the time because I can go on so in

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,500
some ways my experience says parallel

00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,420
the experience of people the day where

00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,290
they're going to say code schools or

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,759
being self-taught at programming I

00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:22,590
started writing code back when there

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:25,170
weren't really programmers gosh I won't

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:27,990
even tell you what year but it involved

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:31,070
punching cards let me say that ok right

00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:34,560
so mainframe computers were just

00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:37,650
becoming affordable and so there weren't

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,479
programmers and I ended up going to

00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:42,840
votech school trying to you know I ended

00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:44,670
up failing out of music school and going

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,500
to votech school trying to get a job and

00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:49,470
they tried to put I wanted to take

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,079
drafting and I took the little pre test

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:55,909
at the vote Expo and they insisted that

00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:58,799
I that I sign up for data processing in

00:01:55,909 --> 00:02:00,840
and that yeah and that sounded so

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,350
incredibly boring that I resisted it

00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:08,160
idolan need a processing right what is

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:10,530
that and so you know the tech schools

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,930
exist because employers that need

00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,780
skilled labor what

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,299
there's no there aren't enough people a

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,969
cabinet making her auto body or

00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:24,569
mechanics right there was a time I know

00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:29,189
it's unbelievable when votech school's

00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:31,250
top computer programming and so I after

00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:34,709
resisting mightily ended up caving and

00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:37,109
going to data processing at votech

00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:40,709
school and on the morning of day one I

00:02:37,109 --> 00:02:43,260
wrote a Fortran program and it was like

00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:47,549
magic all right remember the first

00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:49,500
program year of a road it was like oh it

00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:51,209
was just astonishing like I caught the

00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,980
bug that day and I've been writing code

00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:55,620
ever since and that was a long long long

00:02:52,980 --> 00:03:01,260
time ago nice yeah I definitely know

00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:03,269
that feeling I my first program was some

00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,010
random saying that I wrote with my dad

00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:09,120
when I was super young i was like maybe

00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:12,540
nine ten kids here uh it was a pc it was

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:16,500
a like a old old old gate like when

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:19,079
gateway had like the golden g ago like

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,870
that happen gateway Adele were big

00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:24,780
competitors yeah yeah um I think was

00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:28,979
like I'm i think was like a pentium one

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:31,319
maybe pentium too yeah yeah that was

00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:33,000
okay so okay wait Emma I want to know

00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:34,620
from you what was your first first

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,599
computer program what language and what

00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:41,340
hardware um I think it was a sick I had

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,430
a little bit of exposure to we had an

00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:48,750
old Tandy box that my brother played

00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:51,299
with occasionally and um but I think

00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:56,579
that my first experiences were basic on

00:03:51,299 --> 00:04:02,150
our old HP pavilion something as Windows

00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:07,519
95 bucks is still the 80 motherboard a

00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:10,829
form factor and whatnot you know pre uh

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,629
acpi power on and off thing where you

00:04:10,829 --> 00:04:17,970
actually had like whether it's which via

00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:19,079
the power supply on its own um it's

00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:24,840
funny because it did have a button on

00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:26,099
the front for suspend before uh it was

00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,740
like before suspend really meant that

00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:30,400
much

00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:33,880
again not s3s and suspender at every but

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,560
didn't have a turbo button okay I was

00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,090
waiting to jump in but i'll come back

00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:42,000
let's come back to the turbo when

00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:47,560
amateur it didn't have a turbo button um

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:52,660
it did I think it was a pentium one with

00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:55,389
like it was before the AH gosh what was

00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:59,770
it it was it was it was I think it had

00:04:55,389 --> 00:05:02,009
MMX exactly that that's the seat or the

00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:08,830
feature that I had was like mxs emek

00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:11,020
mmxi uh yeah sorry got and we had a we

00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:15,580
had gte internet I don't know if that

00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:17,979
helps at all of it like before AOL or

00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:25,900
before we had a well there's that and

00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:31,389
then of course AOL ought to gig hard

00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:33,669
drive i think it was very scared ok so i

00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:37,990
actually built bought parts and build an

00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:42,070
80 80 60 it had a turbo button on it

00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:45,250
that switched it from 4.77 up to like

00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:48,909
nine megahertz whatever it was the chip

00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:53,800
right i mean it was it had a 30 oh my

00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:55,750
gosh see what would it okay I get them

00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,810
all confused so right now if I it's not

00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:01,180
gigs it's maybe Meg's would that have

00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:03,580
been a 30 it was a 20 but you could do

00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:06,219
some weird reformatting which made it

00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:09,159
incredibly unreliable to turn it up to

00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:12,819
thirty to thirty mega hard drive right

00:06:09,159 --> 00:06:15,460
it was horrifying he could do very

00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:17,860
little I mean it was das right yeah man

00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,960
windows was a big like windows three was

00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:23,740
such a big upgrade anyway back in the

00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:25,599
day yeah programming we think it's in

00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:28,150
our blood right we never stopped being

00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:30,639
nerds yeah yeah it's actually really

00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,289
interesting to kind of see all that

00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:36,880
stuff like to kind of be nostalgic about

00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:39,130
it i think it's yeah i think

00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,530
I think that it was it was it's nice to

00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:45,880
see like it's it's really cool to see

00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:48,580
that you you know got into it so so long

00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:52,900
ago and yet you're still like a big name

00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:55,230
and you're still still doing it I I mean

00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:59,410
the big name thing was an accident okay

00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:01,600
fine everybody use a programmer okay I

00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:04,030
mean definitely in my sort of long

00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,010
programming career I know programmers

00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:07,600
who seem bored with their jobs right I

00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:12,280
work places where people single were

00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:14,590
their job but but most of us who you

00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,510
stay sort of attached and interested in

00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:19,810
enthusiasm about programming like we

00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:21,850
never get bored because it's fun right

00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:24,100
it never ceases to be fun so it's

00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:25,570
amazing I I feel incredibly lucky like I

00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:29,440
was one of the people that got in this

00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:31,510
so early and then now I look back and I

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:36,070
think would I have done if I hadn't been

00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:38,590
raincoat yeah like I can't think of a

00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:40,990
job that would have you know that would

00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:44,970
be that could have maintained its

00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:47,350
interest and challenge for so many years

00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:49,960
yeah and that's the thing too is that

00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:53,620
it's also it's also a career path where

00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:55,240
like there is always something else to

00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,190
learn like the thing that I love so much

00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,290
as I'm continually learning and

00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:02,740
continually like new stuff is coming out

00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:05,290
a new you know ways of doing things like

00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,240
it's definitely profession where there's

00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:08,530
no shortage of things you can learn and

00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,470
things you can try and things that you

00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:13,420
can do yeah and that's a huge benefit

00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:15,730
but it's also a huge stressor for a lot

00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:18,460
of programmers to ya effect that that

00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:21,960
stream of information like the things

00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:25,180
that we have to know to do our jobs keep

00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:31,510
changing and you can't like you can't

00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:34,410
stop yeah good and bad yeah yeah um so I

00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:36,580
guess uh we can sort of pause on that

00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:38,500
like one of the things that I've found

00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,599
that helps me is that I just sort of

00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,250
like I guess I've been fortunate enough

00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:44,500
to the things that I'm presented with to

00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:46,089
learn are things that I'm just so read

00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:50,570
or like ridiculously interested in

00:08:46,089 --> 00:08:54,029
learning um but do you have any like

00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:55,950
advice where I guess advice for how to

00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:59,330
try and stay ahead of that and try and

00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:01,649
keep trying to find things to say I

00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:06,959
don't know I feel like I'm terrible at

00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:09,120
that like I'm terrible at knowing wait

00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,170
like I i have friends let me say this i

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,779
have friends who are really good at

00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:17,450
keeping up with what's going on in the

00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:20,279
world and I rely on them to tell me like

00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:22,770
trends that I might need to pay more

00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:24,630
attention to and so that would be one

00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:27,180
bit of advice right some people seem

00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,709
hardwired to be good at that like they

00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,880
seem to read everything and pay

00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:32,040
attention to everything and know

00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,260
everything and if you're not that kind

00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,209
of person which i'm really not like i

00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:38,220
like i don't want to answer my email I

00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:40,470
don't want to take phone calls right I

00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,660
want to put my head down and do work and

00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:44,339
so what that means is there's a whole

00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,709
body if there's a whole stream of

00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:49,350
information flowing around me which I'm

00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:51,480
not paying that much attention to and it

00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:54,899
could go badly wrong right not paying

00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:56,730
attention and so I I do two things one

00:09:54,899 --> 00:09:58,620
is it a friend gave me some great advice

00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:00,360
when I was stressing about like not

00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,440
keeping up not reading hacker news every

00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,180
day right you can go on and on not

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,430
following everybody on twitter not it's

00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:08,089
just it never ends the stuff that you

00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:10,890
could feel like you had to know about in

00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:13,050
this great friend Jen may lives in June

00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:14,190
may we lives in san fran and she's in

00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:16,410
that startup scene where they're all

00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,550
kind of crazy anyway and she told me

00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:22,230
once when I was dressing out she said

00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:23,970
it's just news yeah and and if you if

00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:27,570
you ignore it it'll be gone tomorrow

00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:28,860
there will be new news and so that was

00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:30,959
one piece of advice right don't pay too

00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,490
much attention to it but then the other

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,930
thing is I have a friend who pays a lot

00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:37,110
of attention to it and I just asked him

00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:41,490
I stupidly so it's good what should I

00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:43,920
know so yeah enlist others who are good

00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:48,600
at it that would be my advice okay yeah

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:50,220
um so you you also uh um so you came to

00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,899
Ruby from small talk i remember i

00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,720
watched a talk where you you kind of

00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:58,589
showed was it six key words at small

00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,860
talk head yeah so what drew you to Ruby

00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:03,520
what you know I had a real job I mean

00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,070
okay I love Ruby oh my

00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:08,800
I'm so grateful for the existence of

00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:10,150
Ruby but I was a small I mean I would

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,660
still be writing small talk if there

00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:17,350
what if there had been a really good

00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:21,100
well supported open source version of

00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:23,170
small talk in the early 90s right the

00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:25,020
problem is we were paying I was working

00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:28,180
at Duke University and we had big apps

00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:30,100
that were written entirely on small

00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,570
talk-- that generate you know that did

00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,220
the grant management stuff for the

00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:35,710
university so there's lots and lots of

00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:38,620
many millions of dollars of money came

00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:41,140
to Duke for grants that were submitted

00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:43,270
through that app and we were just die in

00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:47,860
pain licensing fees I mean it's always

00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:49,750
like the big picture here is you know

00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:53,560
even though there are good open-source

00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:55,570
small talks now the those guys like they

00:11:53,560 --> 00:12:00,310
rolled the dice on closed source and

00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:09,040
lost and we all left yeah yeah and so I

00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:11,260
I was at a conference we write Java I I

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,970
just you know I've always been a I've

00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,620
spent most of my life and dynamically

00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:16,630
typed object-oriented languages and so

00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,920
if you got raised that way then those

00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:20,200
statically typed object-oriented

00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:21,580
languages seemed very constrained Yeah

00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,530
right and I'm not saying that there

00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:26,980
aren't reasons why you'd have to use C++

00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:28,900
or Java there definitely are but in my

00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,850
life I haven't much like I've written

00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:35,440
mostly sort of neither medical or

00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:36,580
business apps and so I came from small

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,580
talk and then it just got too expensive

00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:42,670
in Java had one that at that point back

00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:44,200
in the mid 2000s but I went to a

00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:46,810
conference I was trying to pick it was

00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,630
my job to pick some kind of database

00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:51,490
framework i was looking at hibernate and

00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:53,830
i went to a conference in a guy Bruce

00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:55,870
whatever his name is that road all the

00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:57,730
java ebooks i went to his talk on

00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:59,770
Hibernia nice and i went up to meds and

00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:02,260
I said I represent a group of people a

00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:04,300
group of small talk programmers who have

00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:07,030
transitioned to j2se e and we're looking

00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:10,530
for a database framework and he said go

00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:10,530
see Dave Thomas's talk

00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:17,890
Dave Thomas was there doing that 15

00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:21,100
minute rails demo uh-huh and so I saw

00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:22,990
that and I my boss was away okay here we

00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:26,320
will pretend that my boss never hears

00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:28,480
this podcast so I bottles away i go and

00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,399
i buy the book i buy that tutorial right

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,899
i run home i buy this is what i'll take

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,760
it to work on money i steal it i give it

00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:34,990
to everybody and oh I did the two door

00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,010
over the weekend right I give it to

00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:37,660
every bit of money and I tell him

00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:40,209
everybody has to do this tutorial this

00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:42,570
week because when the boss gets back a

00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:49,029
week from today well you're a real shop

00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:52,360
nice yes they did and we did and so we

00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:56,440
had a big important production app out

00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:58,420
on rails ODOT 13 and made I did made a

00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,459
bunch of terrible decisions right thing

00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,470
about chain doing a technology change

00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:04,570
for a mission-critical app whose

00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:05,950
deadline couldn't slip that's what and

00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:08,350
you know I was the one I had to stand up

00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:10,540
and in public and say we will make this

00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:12,520
work but we did and it is a tribute to

00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,829
rails and so at you know the small talk

00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:18,339
people like Ruby a lot so that it was an

00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:20,260
easy sell to the programmers it was a

00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:22,600
time when open-source seemed a little

00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:25,149
sketchy to the management you know they

00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,589
were afraid but that battles now long

00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:29,500
since been one right ten years later

00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:31,420
would say that close so software was a

00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,529
better deal and open source anyway

00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:35,350
that's how I got to review it was just

00:14:32,529 --> 00:14:38,380
accidental really yeah I feel really

00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:43,120
lucky and you just ended up being like a

00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:45,610
pirate staging a rails you well it was

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,430
such a good idea and I felt okay I know

00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:52,750
it was a okay ribbing rels is a good

00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:54,520
idea it was probably a little it was a

00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:56,649
little humorous involved in me is

00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,540
telling all the people at Duke that I

00:14:56,649 --> 00:15:03,790
could make I could solve whatever

00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:05,800
technical hurdles existed like we went

00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:08,560
production we went live in production

00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:13,149
before mongrel existed when there was

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:15,070
really no good solution well I'm so what

00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:16,870
that's not quite true we were writing it

00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:19,300
mongrel came out while we were writing

00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:20,949
it and then when we were tried to when I

00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:23,440
tried to go from the dev server to the

00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:24,670
prod server nothing worked like to

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,910
before we're going to go live it was

00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:30,310
that kind of life back at like some some

00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:31,690
of the problems weren't saw like you

00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:32,920
could write a really fast app but you

00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:35,610
couldn't actually deploy it to

00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:38,860
production back in those jetties yeah

00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:41,440
and so but he not been it all worked out

00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,850
it was kind of a near thing but you know

00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,980
I think there are a lot of people from

00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:50,500
that era who have stories like this

00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:55,000
right right yeah that's awesome so I

00:15:50,500 --> 00:16:02,020
your I mean Emma do you want to chime in

00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:11,020
sure ah I was wondering um so you know

00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:22,660
you sort of staged a coup and at what

00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:26,430
point did you go from at what point did

00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:30,640
you did your interest in Ruby go from

00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:34,180
you know this thing is better to I want

00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:41,380
to write a book about I never wanted to

00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:43,750
write a book I mean here's a thing and

00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:45,310
people here's what i would say someone

00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:47,920
this is a quote from someone it might be

00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:50,170
Chad Fowler I heard say this that many

00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,760
people want to have written books but

00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:54,850
very few people really want to write

00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:57,820
them right they have written and so I

00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:59,290
didn't I didn't want to write a book I

00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:01,620
went to that firm I went to the first

00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:05,079
railsconf in Chicago whenever that was

00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:08,079
2005-2006 and I ok you know that thing

00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:11,199
where if you know a thing a technical

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:13,810
thing it seems obvious and simple yeah

00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,699
and right you know it's like everybody

00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:17,620
ought to know it I like why would you

00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:20,140
tell anybody a thing that you know

00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:26,290
because that would just be boring all

00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:28,930
right and so and but I had and so I have

00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:30,550
this thing like you know how every we

00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:32,590
all of your strengths are also

00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:36,499
weaknesses like the other side of the

00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:42,529
coin okay so i have this

00:17:36,499 --> 00:17:47,820
really leaky filter in my brain and so

00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:50,279
things get connected in weird ways which

00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:52,019
means that the symptoms of this are that

00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:54,419
I can sometimes say inappropriate things

00:17:52,019 --> 00:17:58,320
and I have to watch out for that right

00:17:54,419 --> 00:18:01,860
just come out but but the other symptoms

00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,869
are that once I and I'm not the

00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,940
brightest guy in the room but once I

00:18:03,869 --> 00:18:08,460
understand a problem very often I can

00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:11,789
explain it in a way that makes sense

00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:15,269
using and uses sort of unexpected

00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:16,889
analogies all right things seem really

00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:18,360
simple to me once I understand now I

00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:20,549
don't always understand right away but

00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:22,200
once they do it's like and so what

00:18:20,549 --> 00:18:26,309
happens is very often for something I

00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:29,460
understand I'm sometimes really confused

00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:31,559
by other people's explanations now I

00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:34,409
tell you this because I walked out of a

00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:35,610
tech talk at that first rails coffin so

00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:37,049
I don't even know what it was someone

00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:40,289
was explaining something he made it

00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:43,619
sound incomprehensible it was just

00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:44,759
absolutely so confusing and it was like

00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:46,440
one of those things where really smart

00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:47,220
people say here's this really smart

00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,749
thing that you're probably already

00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,950
afraid of and look now i'm going to give

00:18:48,749 --> 00:18:51,119
you an explanation that you find in

00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:53,909
comprehensible so at the end you're

00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:55,559
gonna feel really really stupid right

00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:57,480
was one of those things like it did not

00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:59,669
help this explanation so i was out in

00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:01,080
the hall having a rant about that to

00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:04,710
peak to the people i was with I was like

00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,509
God why are they why they do that it

00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,669
just means people feel stupid like this

00:19:06,509 --> 00:19:10,409
is not that hard like it's just a

00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:13,740
feeling you know it's just things people

00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:15,869
don't know like and I got overheard by

00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,389
woman who is now my editor at addison

00:19:15,869 --> 00:19:20,159
wesley oh wow alright so that's what

00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:21,749
happened let that be a lesson to you

00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,509
right i was having a rant in the hall

00:19:21,749 --> 00:19:25,710
and so she started a campaign to get me

00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:28,139
to write a book I don't know what she

00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:30,299
was thinking but she did and I was just

00:19:28,139 --> 00:19:33,059
like I people like me don't write books

00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:36,090
like I right male and documentation in

00:19:33,059 --> 00:19:39,299
code that's what I read and I don't do

00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:44,999
that and so she was very persistent like

00:19:39,299 --> 00:19:47,789
if there's value and puter it really is

00:19:44,999 --> 00:19:49,919
a triumph of old school publishing

00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:52,080
because I didn't want to write it was

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,210
from that date it was almost five years

00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,299
to the day I agreed to start writing it

00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:58,499
oh she never let up every time I went to

00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:03,350
a conference I'd see her and she'd buy

00:19:58,499 --> 00:20:06,479
me an expensive meal not be like oh I

00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:08,249
and since she is cycled through argument

00:20:06,479 --> 00:20:10,979
after argument after argument and I

00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:14,789
finally decided to do it actually

00:20:10,979 --> 00:20:15,989
there's a talk I give about the course

00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:17,399
of writing that because then once I

00:20:15,989 --> 00:20:19,470
started writing and it took me two years

00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:22,080
to do it and I pretty much hated every

00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,909
minute of it I wasn't good writing I

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:28,409
didn't really know how to do it I didn't

00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:31,259
know it was just hard you know I read a

00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:32,849
lot so my steam you know I like the if

00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:34,249
your reader your standards for the

00:20:32,849 --> 00:20:37,799
written word are very high but then

00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:40,200
producing stuff that reads well to you

00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:42,269
as a reader is not as easy as one might

00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,840
think it doesn't just pour out not of me

00:20:42,269 --> 00:20:49,859
anyway so anyway so I wrote the book

00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:52,229
because in the end I just gave in and

00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:53,879
said I would and then I started on it

00:20:52,229 --> 00:20:57,929
because of that and then I finished it

00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:59,489
because after a year of working on it i

00:20:57,929 --> 00:21:03,749
realized that i would hate myself

00:20:59,489 --> 00:21:06,090
forever if I quit right because what do

00:21:03,749 --> 00:21:08,220
you do are you gonna quit quit it's a

00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:09,239
big project I kept in a secret for a

00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,590
long time I didn't tell people I was

00:21:09,239 --> 00:21:14,700
working on the book and I did that so I

00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:15,840
could quit without feeling bad and then

00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,549
I finally started telling people I was

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,169
working on I can't people would tell me

00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:20,849
oh you know let me read it I want to

00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:22,470
read it let's give me a chapter and I

00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:23,879
would give people what I'd written and

00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:26,129
no one would read it they're all busy

00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:28,499
that's not I mean I'm not this is not a

00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:30,269
complaint but no one you know no one is

00:21:28,499 --> 00:21:34,889
interested no one is as interested in

00:21:30,269 --> 00:21:36,119
your problems as you are Yeah right so I

00:21:34,889 --> 00:21:41,190
would give him the book in the wind rain

00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:44,249
so I had knowed did you know i did it i

00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:47,879
mean i did it because in the end I felt

00:21:44,249 --> 00:21:51,659
like I would hate myself forever if I

00:21:47,879 --> 00:21:54,419
didn't finish and I wrote it for I wrote

00:21:51,659 --> 00:22:00,119
down the thing that I wish someone had

00:21:54,419 --> 00:22:01,649
told me you know and that's really and

00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:05,460
so it's fine you know people everywhere

00:22:01,649 --> 00:22:12,809
I go people well alright let me see this

00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:14,849
so I ok can't read your own press you

00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:16,619
can't because what is it you know that I

00:22:14,849 --> 00:22:18,480
mean now there's sort of this internet

00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:21,659
sandy there's internet sandy and there's

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,970
me and I'm okay like I don't mind

00:22:21,659 --> 00:22:26,820
playing internet sandy when I go out in

00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:28,739
public I do it you know and people would

00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,539
I hear people I hear people saying to me

00:22:28,739 --> 00:22:33,539
things that I say to other people who

00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:36,389
are very influential to me right I met

00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:39,059
can't back recently and I told him how

00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:41,789
much his books had meant to me and and I

00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:45,210
could I recognized in his response to me

00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:47,489
the thing I say right because because

00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:51,649
what you want to do say you want to be

00:22:47,489 --> 00:22:54,480
gracious and grateful without accepting

00:22:51,649 --> 00:22:57,869
that you are in any way special at least

00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,599
I do yeah right and so the things you

00:22:57,869 --> 00:23:05,190
say are things like I'm so it's I'm so

00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:09,859
glad it was useful to you mmm I mean

00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:12,210
seriously and so you know it's important

00:23:09,859 --> 00:23:14,399
now here I'm going on a whole tangent

00:23:12,210 --> 00:23:16,200
now and I'm not going to do that it's so

00:23:14,399 --> 00:23:17,429
I wrote a book the original question I

00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,690
remember the original question why did

00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:21,440
you write a book I wrote a book not

00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:23,820
really because I wanted to write a book

00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:28,080
but but I'll tell you this i'm very glad

00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:29,460
I did who knew yeah yeah I mean I here's

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,609
what I would say you guys should write

00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:35,519
books there's something you know now

00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:37,940
that you didn't used to know yeah it's

00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:41,389
sort of generous open-hearted

00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:44,369
explanation of that to your earlier self

00:23:41,389 --> 00:23:49,320
has an audience and that might be

00:23:44,369 --> 00:23:52,259
surprisingly big hmm yeah yeah yeah I

00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:55,769
think that that is a lot of the things

00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:58,979
that you said especially the that you

00:23:55,769 --> 00:24:00,599
recognize your own statements back I

00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:03,690
hope it was I hope I'm glad it was

00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:06,659
useful to you or even you know um I've

00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:10,259
noticed that even and I've given a

00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:12,149
couple of talks I mean I'm pretty new in

00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:12,930
the game but I give it a couple of talks

00:24:12,149 --> 00:24:17,820
at

00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:21,360
going to play and uh you know I it's

00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:26,160
it's stuff that again like he said I

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:28,260
thought was pretty simple and I also

00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:32,040
accept that there are probably people

00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:34,380
there who went and left it and you know

00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:37,590
less the building and were like oh why

00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:40,980
did she say this like this but um you

00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:42,510
know in the end I guess I some some

00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:46,050
people did come up to me afterwards and

00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:47,400
say hey I learned a lot and that you

00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:49,050
know helped connect some dots or

00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,370
something like that that's it's one of

00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:51,330
the nice things that I like to see and

00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:53,940
it's one of the nice things that I

00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:55,500
that's why I like to see talks even

00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:58,980
about things that I already know about

00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:02,210
because you know if nothing else getting

00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:05,630
that read on some some other person's

00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:10,920
interpretations of something yeah I

00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:13,040
really great so let me okay I'm gonna

00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:16,140
jump in good on you for giving a talk

00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:20,220
right well so many people don't right

00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:21,930
they like that fear that we have of you

00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:23,430
know I don't know what I mean there's a

00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:25,170
couple things right like I'm gonna look

00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:26,580
like an idiot I'm gonna fall to her I'm

00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:28,670
gonna choke myself for fall off the

00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:32,790
stage or everybody knows it already

00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:36,810
right who am I to say a thing right that

00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:40,410
thing gets in the way in I don't know

00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:41,550
the feeling like like you know someone

00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:44,670
told me something really interesting

00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:45,930
early on and they said divide your

00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:47,580
audience into thirds and who knows of

00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:49,680
thurs is the right but it just seems to

00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:52,410
your experience given this talk and it

00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:53,370
seems to validate this he said a third

00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:55,770
of the people already know it and

00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:58,230
they're like yeah uh third of the people

00:25:55,770 --> 00:26:00,000
are the third of the people are so new

00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:02,000
it's such a new idea to them but they're

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,140
like oh no way that's the way too hard

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,970
and a third of the people are right

00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,930
there and you're making you're helping

00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:10,740
them take that next step and they're

00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:15,300
like oh mind blown what an amazing idea

00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:17,550
right so there's that like it is that

00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:19,080
right it's always it's for someone even

00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:20,910
if it's not for everybody when it been

00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:23,460
then when I was writing puter my editor

00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:24,840
told me a thing which I thought which

00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:26,820
actually started to be very very true

00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:33,059
she said people love the story

00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:34,710
no yeah yeah and that if you and that

00:26:33,059 --> 00:26:35,850
goes to your thing about like I they

00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:40,830
heard it in a different way put a

00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:43,380
different way right right like if you if

00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:46,320
you respect your audience by showing up

00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:48,720
well prepared they don't really care if

00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,240
they already know it but they love

00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,519
hearing it put the way you would put it

00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,690
and I find that very comforting right

00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:56,429
it's like ok they're not gonna eat me

00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:59,809
alive even if they're you know it like

00:26:56,429 --> 00:27:04,980
all i have to do is do is respect them

00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:07,110
by showing up having you know clearly

00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,059
worked on this talk clearly done

00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:11,159
preparation clearly practice clearly

00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:13,710
made slides if i do all those things

00:27:11,159 --> 00:27:15,809
then even the people who already know

00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:21,840
everything i'm going to say or gonna

00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:23,460
enjoy the talk yeah it's a it's really

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:27,450
interesting because i tend to suffer

00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:29,759
from the same kind of like I whenever

00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:32,129
anybody like I'm really bad at taking

00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:34,289
compliments sometimes like people tell

00:27:32,129 --> 00:27:35,399
me like this is really good like you you

00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:37,500
did this really well and I just like

00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:39,389
never know what to say really so I'm

00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:41,820
usually just like thanks I can help you

00:27:39,389 --> 00:27:44,009
here's what you say right we practice

00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:45,779
right now actually say something nice to

00:27:44,009 --> 00:27:50,669
me say something nice to me will

00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:52,559
practice okay uh um so I really enjoyed

00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:54,029
the talk you gave on dependency

00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,580
injection I thought it was it definitely

00:27:54,029 --> 00:27:58,320
changed the way that I thought about

00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:59,639
dealing with inheritance so that

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,679
actually changed a lot of the way that I

00:27:59,639 --> 00:28:03,750
approach problem solving thank you so

00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,159
much it's really a pleasure to hear that

00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:08,039
it was a lot of work to put it together

00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:10,379
and it makes it worthwhile to hear that

00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:17,370
it's valuable to people see there you go

00:28:10,379 --> 00:28:19,049
you just think oh it's a weird okay

00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:22,470
there's a weird balance right between

00:28:19,049 --> 00:28:26,909
like like do you feel like you're

00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:29,159
smarter than everybody else no no no we

00:28:26,909 --> 00:28:33,570
are not in we are not in any danger of

00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:35,100
turning sorry right but you

00:28:33,570 --> 00:28:37,500
have to take the compliment because

00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:40,000
their comp right you have to take it and

00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,830
so don't be too deflected so stop that

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,630
both okay all right I don't know if

00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:48,010
you're doing it maybe you're not but yes

00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:49,780
there's a way to be deflective about

00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:52,500
like like I don't want to hear that your

00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:56,470
special thing that that makes me afraid

00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:58,210
yeah but but I'll it does it does it's

00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:01,540
like what because if you buy into that

00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:06,630
then that it seems like you come to a

00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:11,020
bad end right yes that can come of that

00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:13,210
but but for to have people value your

00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:17,380
efforts that's a wonderful thing that

00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:20,080
never gets old yeah yeah yeah that's

00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:25,150
very I think it's kind of funny like I

00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:27,820
don't know it seems and all positions

00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:32,470
are wrong as we know including this one

00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:35,260
but it seems like there are a lot of

00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:41,110
people in tech who follow that same sort

00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:42,940
of idea of of like no nobody wants to

00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:46,750
hear what I have to say about this thing

00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:50,770
and then um I almost wonder in some

00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:54,190
cases if that's like if tech kind of

00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:57,910
even attracts the sort of people who who

00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:59,890
don't want to do that sort of thing but

00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:03,010
on the other hand I mean I really try

00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:04,930
attracts everybody its class I mean my

00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:10,390
interactions with everyone else around

00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:12,510
us around me I you know are completely

00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:14,790
different from the next person's but um

00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:17,770
it's funny because I mean I think that

00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:21,730
like you said everybody knows something

00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:24,580
so it's really easy to fall into the

00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:26,320
trap of I mean like someone came to me

00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:28,390
and was like you should do talk about

00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,370
this thing I was like no no no and then

00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:32,350
I ended up doing it and it was fine and

00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:39,490
you know what helped some people and

00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:40,960
then um I've talked to other people and

00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:44,280
they've I've been like you should do a

00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,290
talk about this thing like you know you

00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:48,940
you having this conversation with me

00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:50,530
really opened my eyes to you know a

00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:52,300
different way of looking at something

00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:53,779
something that comes to mind a whole lot

00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:56,359
is version control

00:30:53,779 --> 00:30:58,759
like specifically not using version

00:30:56,359 --> 00:31:00,679
control but like ways of Manning's

00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:03,799
managing version control other than

00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:05,570
here's some code I committed it huh you

00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:07,759
know rewriting history and rebasing and

00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:11,419
stuff I had a talk with a friend a long

00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:15,019
time ago who and still pushing to maybe

00:31:11,419 --> 00:31:19,729
potentially give it time but um I really

00:31:15,019 --> 00:31:21,379
enjoyed that uh and so I think maybe in

00:31:19,729 --> 00:31:23,119
general it's sort of that sort of thing

00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,950
I don't know I guess I guess the point

00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:29,089
is maybe we should all be pushing each

00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:33,820
other to talk and I think I hope that at

00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:36,950
least code and supply so plug again ah

00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:38,719
you know helps people feel good in that

00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:40,820
sort of way sorry you were gonna say

00:31:38,719 --> 00:31:41,809
something in no no what you just made me

00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:44,359
have a thousand thoughts and I was

00:31:41,809 --> 00:31:45,979
trying not interrupting just you take

00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:48,109
you off on a digression from but before

00:31:45,979 --> 00:31:52,460
I go let me digress once code supply

00:31:48,109 --> 00:31:54,979
awesome name awesome a very much like

00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:58,460
going to the hardware store to get code

00:31:54,979 --> 00:32:01,039
I love that it's kind of its kind of

00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:03,830
Pittsburgh II uh you know Pittsburgh

00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:09,219
being an industrial town by nature up

00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:09,219
until the EPA became a thing basically

00:32:15,729 --> 00:32:21,769
Pittsburgh's things so yeah it's that I

00:32:18,649 --> 00:32:24,229
had no involvement in making that name

00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:28,190
but go Justin and or any other folks

00:32:24,229 --> 00:32:31,099
were part of that yeah sure but yeah it

00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:33,349
seemed really good so I'm coming up our

00:32:31,099 --> 00:32:35,869
abstractions conference soil I hope to

00:32:33,349 --> 00:32:38,839
get I hope to find schwag oh we've got

00:32:35,869 --> 00:32:45,710
swag yeah so I need a t-shirt that says

00:32:38,839 --> 00:32:47,419
code supply yeah I'm just saying so you

00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:49,460
guys get on that the logos cool it

00:32:47,419 --> 00:32:50,929
should be on a t-shirt okay wait so I

00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:54,710
wrote down two things while you were

00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:58,419
talking about the whole thing about it

00:32:54,710 --> 00:33:04,869
was an interesting thought that our

00:32:58,419 --> 00:33:04,869
business might draw people who

00:33:05,779 --> 00:33:13,009
of okay the notion that we're the people

00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:15,769
that say no one's here everybody knows

00:33:13,009 --> 00:33:18,830
that no one wants to hear it it made me

00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:21,999
think gosh is it is it possible that we

00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:25,190
all have more humility than average

00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:27,859
because there's this but well because

00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:31,879
there's this notion of tech as sort of

00:33:27,859 --> 00:33:36,259
the you know hotshot egotistical jerk

00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:38,529
programmer and and it's definitely they

00:33:36,259 --> 00:33:42,049
exist there's no doubt about that but

00:33:38,529 --> 00:33:44,389
maybe there's a silent majority of us so

00:33:42,049 --> 00:33:47,029
that was a really that was just a novel

00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:49,149
idea to me the the other reaction I had

00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:53,359
when you said that was like well maybe

00:33:49,149 --> 00:33:56,690
maybe it's maybe if that's true it could

00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:58,519
also be that you know one of the one of

00:33:56,690 --> 00:34:00,200
the things about the business we're in

00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:06,080
is there's lots and lots and lots of

00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:07,879
opportunity to get to teach a group to

00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,500
get up in front of give a talk like

00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:11,000
there's a way in which it's very self

00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,409
selecting but there are tons of

00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,480
opportunities and that those

00:34:12,409 --> 00:34:18,829
opportunities just don't exist in other

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:23,059
businesses if you're a bank manager you

00:34:18,829 --> 00:34:25,639
go to conferences and give talks right

00:34:23,059 --> 00:34:28,669
if you sell car less so there's there's

00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:32,240
one sense that we have this enormous you

00:34:28,669 --> 00:34:34,279
know opportunity to do that but then in

00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:37,490
order to do it very often it's self

00:34:34,279 --> 00:34:40,609
selecting well there's a way in which

00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:42,859
someone came and got me but that's a

00:34:40,609 --> 00:34:45,829
rare experience right mostly people have

00:34:42,859 --> 00:34:49,549
to choose to give tues to give a talk to

00:34:45,829 --> 00:34:51,440
choose to get on that path and then then

00:34:49,549 --> 00:34:52,760
you have to overcome both things right

00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,779
you have to overcome your natural

00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:59,660
reticence your natural humility and then

00:34:56,779 --> 00:35:03,650
the absolute you know it can be

00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:05,539
terrifying and so the into that drag

00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:08,299
drag me back around to D now that you've

00:35:05,539 --> 00:35:10,309
given some talks are you do you think of

00:35:08,299 --> 00:35:12,200
yourself as somebody gives talks or you

00:35:10,309 --> 00:35:14,720
give are you prepping your next stop are

00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,010
you submitting to conferences do both of

00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,350
you I would like to hear the neck sort

00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:20,260
of that question

00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:22,240
I've been told that I should submit or

00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:25,690
submit it to some more conferences I

00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:29,610
still am not there yet um I think that

00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:32,940
this podcast is actually part of that

00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:35,950
and I don't know I i was brought in by

00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:38,500
Alex and Justin after some time after

00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:40,570
they had Ted sometime in the podcast so

00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:48,400
I think I bad had something to do with

00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:50,710
that maybe um but yeah I I think in a

00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,210
lot of cases i'm waiting to like feel

00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:55,240
like I actually have like a pretty good

00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:57,070
handle on something before I can I do

00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:07,560
which is funny because I'm gonna do that

00:35:57,070 --> 00:36:12,520
with that I wrote that down here going

00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:14,800
but like are you a person do you think

00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:17,050
of it like now okay my self-identity

00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,090
right for a million years I would tell

00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:23,680
you I write code that's what I do but

00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:24,990
now I teach and I give talks and it you

00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,400
know frankly I don't write enough code

00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:29,260
right that that's the sad that's the

00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:31,720
only sad thing about my life I do really

00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:34,510
do miss that all day long every day

00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:39,520
writing code and it's year and more fun

00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:41,920
really than almost anything but there's

00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:43,510
an identity switch if you become the

00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,070
kind of person who gives ox at

00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:48,960
conferences or become the kind of person

00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:54,850
who runs a podcast and it requires

00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:58,030
accepting that you have you things to

00:36:54,850 --> 00:37:01,920
say that are useful to Utley to some

00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:05,530
category of others and that's a hurdle

00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:09,060
accepting that as truth right it being

00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:12,580
okay with that right mr. to Humble Alex

00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:13,780
really it is and so it's not so bad when

00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:15,070
you answer that question for me here I

00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:21,310
didn't enter I don't mean to turn this

00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:23,890
into an interrogation but it um so I

00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:27,760
will say I don't uh I don't identify

00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:30,070
somebody who gives talks I do like

00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,850
giving talks but I don't like I'm not on

00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:33,420
the

00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:35,920
in circuit or submitting you know

00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:38,410
proposals for presentations to every

00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:39,700
conference that comes across but I do

00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:41,910
have actually really funny story about

00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:50,650
the first talk that I ever gave the team

00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:52,900
which was on mini test and like there's

00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:54,610
no video of it thankfully because I

00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:59,290
asked Justin if he had a video and

00:37:54,610 --> 00:38:01,150
there's not um but I get up and I have I

00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:03,910
used like I didn't use keynote or

00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:05,680
PowerPoint or anything I used xjs and

00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:08,410
like a website so i had like that i had

00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,240
a Jekyll site serving some hand like

00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:13,690
serving just like I done the slides and

00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:16,830
Hammel and had it running um the code is

00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:23,380
actually on github for the for this talk

00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:26,950
but the CSS like I like modified the CSS

00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:30,310
at the last minute and the resolution of

00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:35,770
the screen was four by three aspect

00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:37,570
ratio my laptop is 16 by 10 so I like

00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:39,310
the first thing that happens when i

00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:41,170
switch from the first slide where it's

00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:43,270
just as mini test across the front of it

00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:45,670
to the next slide is everything is off

00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:50,770
what the whole thing is off and i was

00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:52,480
just like oh crap like what do i do so I

00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:53,890
like went back and I tried to like I

00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,150
really quickly try to lie change

00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:57,310
something and it didn't work so I just

00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:58,270
like went back and was like well we're

00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:00,280
gonna do this and I'll just scroll

00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:02,980
through the code and do this so like the

00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:08,260
slides were awful completely living it

00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:11,890
on stage yeah um and it was one of those

00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:14,560
things to wear like I the first maybe 30

00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:18,460
seconds or a minute I was dying inside

00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:21,190
because I was just like this is crap I

00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:23,050
don't want to turn yeah like I I don't

00:39:21,190 --> 00:39:25,540
know if it was visible to anybody like i

00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:28,240
imagine i had to be like the grossest

00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:30,190
shade of green but then afterwards like

00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,840
after i got into it and i just got into

00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:33,670
my spiel where I was like this is how

00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:36,280
many test works this is how all of its

00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:37,720
like must syntax works this one method

00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,070
is everything you need to know about all

00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,850
of the magic that happens in this

00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:44,170
library like once I got into that um

00:39:41,850 --> 00:39:44,710
it's like I started to feel a lot better

00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:47,200
and by the

00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:50,830
and I felt completely fine and despite

00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:54,099
the fact that the slide deck was broken

00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:57,690
beyond belief I felt really good and so

00:39:54,099 --> 00:40:00,040
in a way it's kind of it was kind of

00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:03,099
liberating for me to do the next talk

00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:05,349
because in my mind the worst possible

00:40:03,099 --> 00:40:06,970
thing that could have happened already

00:40:05,349 --> 00:40:10,720
happened in the first talk and that was

00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:14,440
perfectly fine so like the next one was

00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:17,440
just gonna be better right ah I do have

00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:19,690
a talk that I'm kicking around ideas for

00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,030
uh I don't know I gotta like figure out

00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:27,310
I got to figure it out still it's like

00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:29,530
um it's the it's basically I have like a

00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:33,160
slug for it which is just like make

00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:34,599
change easy but I don't I don't have

00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,839
anything other than that but it's based

00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:40,869
like basically I I think sometimes

00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:44,980
people back themselves into corners with

00:40:40,869 --> 00:40:46,570
code and so it's basically when you have

00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:50,530
to go and revisit code or look at code

00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:52,180
like take a minute and look at it and do

00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:55,720
whatever whatever work you're doing like

00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:57,609
just it's kind of inspired by Kent backs

00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,680
quote that you put on twitter which is

00:40:57,609 --> 00:41:02,950
lazy and then make the easy changes yeah

00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:05,619
it's kind of based on that but I gotta

00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:08,500
figure out a good code example cuz the

00:41:05,619 --> 00:41:10,089
hardest thing right yeah yeah like it

00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,440
because now you're trying to make an

00:41:10,089 --> 00:41:14,680
example that everyone in the audience

00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:17,560
can understand in two minutes Yeah Yeah

00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:19,119
right good luck with that yeah i mean it

00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:22,240
is possible it's just hard it's really

00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:24,430
that's a war finding the thing the

00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:28,480
sketch that stands in for the you know

00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:29,800
the art painting yeah that you can teach

00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:31,450
you know where you can give people the

00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,310
idea and let them extrapolate from it

00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:36,869
out to the bigger picture in one yeah

00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:41,470
yeah and justin is really i'm gonna say

00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:42,760
encouraging as a euphemism freeze like

00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:45,250
yeah you gotta do it you gotta do it

00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:47,230
like he's he's really good about trying

00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:50,890
to get people to give talks he's hmm

00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:52,450
it's very good yeah i mean it's not for

00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:54,490
everybody first of all all right so we

00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:56,380
want to be careful about not make people

00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:58,299
feel like their lives aren't worth

00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:00,699
living if they don't want to get

00:41:58,299 --> 00:42:04,170
talks but I mean I think there's

00:42:00,699 --> 00:42:07,779
probably a lot of people out there who

00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:09,579
would love to do it like what why don't

00:42:07,779 --> 00:42:11,109
why don't why isn't everybody lined up

00:42:09,579 --> 00:42:14,739
to give a talk they don't feel qualified

00:42:11,109 --> 00:42:16,150
or they're afraid yeah right and there's

00:42:14,739 --> 00:42:19,150
probably a third category which is don't

00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:20,589
have time right yeah right and I feel

00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:23,319
completely respectful of the don't have

00:42:20,589 --> 00:42:25,420
time people have lives and families and

00:42:23,319 --> 00:42:29,380
kids and dogs I have a dog now oh my

00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:32,130
gosh talk about the time sink puppy

00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:36,039
because that's my excuse for everything

00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:37,900
yes okay so but so either you feel

00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:39,729
unqualified and we've just decided that

00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:41,559
that's not true because you know things

00:42:39,729 --> 00:42:43,449
that you know things now that you didn't

00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:45,309
used to know so all you have to do is

00:42:43,449 --> 00:42:49,719
tell that you used to be the thing you

00:42:45,309 --> 00:42:51,369
know now right that's a talk um you

00:42:49,719 --> 00:42:53,469
don't have time well then that you just

00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:55,420
you know you don't you don't have time

00:42:53,469 --> 00:42:57,939
didn't then you don't do it right but

00:42:55,420 --> 00:43:03,670
then there's that big category of feel

00:42:57,939 --> 00:43:08,589
terrified yeah right and you know and

00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:10,449
some people so okay so let me ask you

00:43:08,589 --> 00:43:12,479
see you see you got up on stage and your

00:43:10,449 --> 00:43:16,599
slide for a total disaster and you're

00:43:12,479 --> 00:43:20,109
some shade of green but then right away

00:43:16,599 --> 00:43:22,329
it got better yeah say why tell people

00:43:20,109 --> 00:43:26,140
why what happened when i run stage what

00:43:22,329 --> 00:43:30,640
did you notice um I think like the

00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:33,099
change was that I was so like I really

00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,900
like mini tests like I like that that I

00:43:33,099 --> 00:43:36,789
can read the whole thing in an hour and

00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:38,679
know how it's working I know every bit

00:43:36,789 --> 00:43:40,989
of magic in it and I can't even begin to

00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:43,509
open up our spec and like figure it out

00:43:40,989 --> 00:43:46,439
so I couldn't really right yeah so I

00:43:43,509 --> 00:43:49,569
knew the subject matter really well and

00:43:46,439 --> 00:43:52,689
to sing very well prepared right yeah

00:43:49,569 --> 00:43:57,160
that helps when you're terrified yeah

00:43:52,689 --> 00:43:59,079
what else um and then to like once I

00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:01,900
started talking and going through it

00:43:59,079 --> 00:44:03,219
like the things that I was scared of

00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,509
which is like this is broken and

00:44:03,219 --> 00:44:06,069
nobody's gonna like it just didn't

00:44:04,509 --> 00:44:08,140
happen it wasn't like I got booed off

00:44:06,069 --> 00:44:11,319
the stage or people started throwing you

00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:12,040
know honey I'm trying I'm trying to get

00:44:11,319 --> 00:44:13,390
you to say is

00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:15,670
very specific thing about the audience

00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:17,080
right like what happened he looked at at

00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:20,590
the minate you thought they would hate

00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:22,390
you but instead what did what feel II

00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:25,870
did you get from the people who are at

00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:27,280
your talk that they were just they

00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:30,790
wanted to hear what I was going to say

00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:33,070
they're rooting for you yeah and you can

00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:34,900
feel it can't you like I like even

00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:37,990
before people even when people didn't

00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:39,940
know my name like like my talks you can

00:44:37,990 --> 00:44:42,460
almost see the difference in them from

00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:44,050
the day that puter got published because

00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:46,270
i was given talks before that and then i

00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:49,480
gave talks after that and after that i'm

00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:51,010
very much you know I go to i get up

00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:55,750
around stage and I feel like everybody's

00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:59,980
like I feel buoyed up by the friendly

00:44:55,750 --> 00:45:01,300
regard of the Ruby community and so when

00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:03,940
I get on stage I feel like their

00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:05,740
favorite aunt you know like I feel like

00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:08,440
I can go through and poke fun of people

00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:10,350
and tell them to behave and shake my

00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:13,660
finger at them I feel very relaxed

00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:16,960
without community now but before when

00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:19,030
people had no idea who I was but I would

00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,040
still could go on stage and you go up

00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:22,240
there and you think you know that you're

00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,070
going to throw up or you get it I have a

00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,870
whole list of fears right I'm going to

00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:28,540
trip walking up the stairs to stage I'm

00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:30,130
going to spill that water they give you

00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:31,720
I'm going to take a drink of that water

00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:34,840
and start choking start coughing on

00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:36,430
stage right the can't get the video

00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:38,410
hooked up like you know you've seen them

00:45:36,430 --> 00:45:40,360
you've seen speakers have all of these

00:45:38,410 --> 00:45:41,740
problems but the truth is when you get

00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:44,560
up there you look at the audience they

00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:47,080
just want their just rootin for you yeah

00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:51,900
and that was this real surprise to me I

00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:54,130
thought they wouldn't want to eat me hey

00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:56,170
and so that i don't know i would tell

00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:58,630
people that right like everybody has

00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:59,980
something to say it's like despite the

00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:01,300
fact that it is terrifying and we don't

00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:03,040
want to discount that at least it was

00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:05,980
for me I was very afraid the first time

00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:09,220
I got on stage to give a talk it turns

00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:11,950
out that they they're not really waiting

00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:14,740
for you to stumble right there trying to

00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:16,420
it they're trying to make you they're

00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:19,690
trying to comfort you as long as you're

00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:22,260
well prepared yeah anyway I want more

00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:25,940
people to give talks can you tell yeah

00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:29,710
yeah I think we should yeah

00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:32,960
yeah I should give more like one people

00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:36,609
yeah it's really not that before

00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:40,280
anything I think you said something

00:46:36,609 --> 00:46:41,480
important it's just offhandedly and that

00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,859
whole thing which is like you know

00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,849
you've seen all these things and it's

00:46:42,859 --> 00:46:45,140
like well yeah you probably have seen

00:46:43,849 --> 00:46:48,170
those things and then you're like oh

00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:50,510
jeez that sucks and then you you know it

00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:53,030
didn't matter and that's rest of the

00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:58,430
times like oh well you know the

00:46:53,030 --> 00:47:01,099
presenter tripped and choked on water is

00:46:58,430 --> 00:47:02,780
like oh I think that's not what you

00:47:01,099 --> 00:47:04,280
remember I mean you remember that happen

00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:05,780
at some point that's not what you

00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:08,210
remember about the content that's the

00:47:05,780 --> 00:47:11,270
thing yeah it didn't it didn't make you

00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:13,160
hate them it made you go whoa for them

00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:17,119
right it made you liked it more if

00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:19,040
anything yeah and so that whole series

00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:21,530
of terrorism I like my night terrors

00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,880
about I mean fortunately almost

00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:25,310
everything that can go wrong has gone

00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:29,810
wrong to me so I got to practice all of

00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:32,690
them and now I just you know I mean I

00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:34,940
was somewhere recently and the I had

00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:37,069
google notifications on so I was in the

00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:39,140
wrong time zone I was in Europe and so

00:47:37,069 --> 00:47:40,010
it was some regular meeting I have like

00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:42,800
I was supposed to go to the gym or

00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:46,400
something and so it popped up and Tino

00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:50,900
ended keynote like like it toggled to

00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:52,670
the foreground and keynote somehow I was

00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:56,180
still open but it was somewhere else and

00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:58,400
I didn't know it because I was standing

00:47:56,180 --> 00:48:00,410
in front of both my laptop and the

00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,910
screen was behind me so I'm like cabin

00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:03,710
on and on and on and they're looking at

00:48:01,910 --> 00:48:08,240
my desk top right is it this of all I

00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:10,160
think is up there I can see they all

00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:11,450
seem a little distracted right you can

00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,550
tell when you're looking at a big

00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:15,440
audience all this and finally I look

00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:16,550
around and I realize it oh that's not I

00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,859
don't even know what they're looking at

00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:20,599
least it's something you know and into

00:48:18,859 --> 00:48:22,550
then I'm like trying to all tab and it's

00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:24,920
all Pavan on the other monitor not my

00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:26,450
monitor so I can't even find like

00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:28,880
anything and finally I look around and I

00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:31,430
realize oh if I just all tab to keynote

00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:33,170
it'll all be fine and I can remember

00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:34,220
telling him I didn't I could not just

00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:37,150
walked up in the front of the stage and

00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:37,150
I said well whatever

00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:42,860
can they all laugh just like that they

00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:45,770
left just like that right and they were

00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:50,650
just like yeah whatever and we do what

00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:52,790
can you do absolutely fantastic yeah

00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:56,330
good let that be a lesson to you turn

00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:57,770
all your notifications off yeah yeah we

00:48:56,330 --> 00:49:00,170
know that but I don't know I never

00:48:57,770 --> 00:49:08,510
thought of my calendar might screw me on

00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:10,820
stage yeah oops yeah I I had a panic

00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:13,460
moment whenever I started my first talk

00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:15,560
that was like oh gosh I got a tab

00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:18,050
through all my tabs and find the Google

00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:22,240
Drive tab oh geez everyone's seeing on

00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:24,530
my Twitter stuff and all my email and

00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:26,300
and I don't even think anybody else

00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:28,430
remember that but I remember that

00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:33,670
because it's one of those things but in

00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:36,560
the end I mean I mean I have learned to

00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:38,060
do everything like before i leave my

00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:40,880
house I have an external monitor here

00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:45,860
which is the same as the you know screen

00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:48,380
and so I set it all up before I unhook

00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:50,060
everything to go I set my laptop up just

00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:52,100
like it's going to be so that i can plug

00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:54,830
in that extra monitor and it will be the

00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:56,630
right you know it'll be which one you

00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:58,250
know the right slot the right place and

00:49:56,630 --> 00:50:01,520
you know the direction i expected

00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:03,050
because I learned to my you know you

00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:04,760
you'll find out to your peril when you

00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:06,410
get up there like like like which what

00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:08,450
is the most painful thing you have seen

00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:10,850
happen two speakers being unable to get

00:50:08,450 --> 00:50:13,040
their slides projected yeah it's the

00:50:10,850 --> 00:50:21,830
most stressful part right it's right I

00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:24,140
can talk right Alex yeah yes yes for

00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:26,990
sure so you know and i revert like i

00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:29,390
read a bunch of books about stress and

00:50:26,990 --> 00:50:30,590
performance under pressure because

00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:34,160
aren't you know I've a psychology degree

00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:36,140
and so I went and looked at like how I

00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:37,730
did research about how to deal with that

00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:40,160
because I was so afraid the first time I

00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:41,690
gave a talk and one of the things they

00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,580
talk about is practice and they and they

00:50:41,690 --> 00:50:45,800
want the practice to be under as

00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:49,010
realistic as circumstances as possible

00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:50,180
and so I do everything like I don't do

00:50:49,010 --> 00:50:51,980
so much anymore

00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:53,690
I'm just more comfortable with it but at

00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:55,490
the beginning I would like come in why

00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:58,070
would walk into my office right here at

00:50:55,490 --> 00:51:00,680
this desk i'm sitting at with my laptop

00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:02,450
and I sit it down and I open it and I

00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:04,370
get my remote out and i hook the dongle

00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:06,410
of and i hook it up to the thing i met

00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:08,660
you know i do it and then i would

00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:11,210
rehearse the talk but the rehearsal

00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:14,000
starts with a closed laptop that's not

00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:16,490
attached to those devices and that

00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:20,180
really helps a lot like even now when i

00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:23,180
get in situations where I can't get my

00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:26,690
slides displayed on the monitor I'm a

00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:28,220
lot more comfortable with it yeah I

00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:30,680
actually do the same thing I have a

00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:32,720
really long cable like hdmi cable that

00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:36,680
comes out from the back of my TV so I

00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:38,630
will just set up like a table with stack

00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:40,570
of books and put my laptop on it plug

00:51:38,630 --> 00:51:46,580
the cable in and I'll like practice it

00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:48,140
staring at an empty couch just like you

00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:50,480
know going through it because then it is

00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:51,920
oh it's exactly the same thing like I'm

00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,840
gonna be looking at the laptop screen

00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:56,210
the actual screens gonna be behind me I

00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:59,960
have my phone in the remote mode and I'm

00:51:56,210 --> 00:52:01,820
doing that like it I do think I do that

00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:03,920
just to make sure that I know what it's

00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:06,260
going to be like well and i'll tell you

00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:08,180
a situation in which that can be turns

00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:11,060
it will turn into real a real handy

00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:12,970
practicing someday like someday you're

00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:16,910
going to be asked to give a talk online

00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:18,320
over a hangout oh yeah and then they

00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:20,540
have to turn everything off on their

00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:23,990
android us you get that echo feedback so

00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:27,200
basically you see nothing but your

00:52:23,990 --> 00:52:29,180
slides just looking at your slides so

00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:31,250
you're so then you have to like talk in

00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:32,900
a really animated way as if people or

00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:37,790
maybe laughing at your jokes in some

00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:39,680
distant land right to really are but if

00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:42,140
you do that if you practice it at home

00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:45,440
then you can give it even you can give

00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:47,390
it to your imaginary audience yeah I

00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:49,730
think that another thing that would also

00:52:47,390 --> 00:52:53,530
work is people who are sort of afraid

00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:55,490
about the concepts of doing a talk

00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:57,770
something that I've been considering is

00:52:55,490 --> 00:53:00,980
also doing some some like screen casts

00:52:57,770 --> 00:53:03,170
or even just like you know like a talk

00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:08,150
to my webcam sort of thing about

00:53:03,170 --> 00:53:12,290
uh whatever topic that I want to talk

00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:14,000
about um I think that that would be

00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:17,030
really useful cuz also I mean that's uh

00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,309
sometimes it's just something that you

00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:21,770
there's somebody's blog post out there

00:53:19,309 --> 00:53:25,010
brakes this thing down in some sort of

00:53:21,770 --> 00:53:28,670
way or whatever uh but there's not

00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:30,170
enough of that for some tech things I

00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:34,819
feel like and that's one of the things

00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:36,530
that I like for instance i use that a

00:53:34,819 --> 00:53:38,319
lot for there's someone who had like

00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:41,960
lectures for like different parts of

00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:48,799
symbolic logic but i used whenever I was

00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:50,390
in in school some years ago and um it

00:53:48,799 --> 00:53:52,099
was it was nice to be able to like watch

00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:54,109
this other person watch someone other

00:53:52,099 --> 00:53:56,000
than my teacher explained it first of

00:53:54,109 --> 00:54:00,470
all you know someone other than the book

00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:02,210
explain it and just watch anybody

00:54:00,470 --> 00:54:06,309
explain it at all like four things that

00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:08,900
I didn't get or whatever um I think that

00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:10,069
there should be a big push for that sort

00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:12,619
of thing and it's probably less

00:54:10,069 --> 00:54:15,559
stressful and I mean it's simultaneously

00:54:12,619 --> 00:54:17,450
more stressful today hmm I don't know

00:54:15,559 --> 00:54:19,069
what stressful like I'm somewhat it's

00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:21,049
less stressful because you don't have to

00:54:19,069 --> 00:54:24,589
work like you can record it again

00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:30,710
whenever your slides don't work and you

00:54:24,589 --> 00:54:32,960
took but you I you also have the added

00:54:30,710 --> 00:54:36,440
pressure of now this thing is is out

00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:40,690
there and it's permanent in air quotes

00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:44,780
will say not so but it's interesting

00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:48,799
yeah it's um a time jitter yeah I you

00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:50,390
know it much more like that seems harder

00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:54,170
to me like it's a little intimidating to

00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:55,339
me to think about getting you know I and

00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:57,740
they needs about it's the perfection

00:54:55,339 --> 00:54:59,150
thing that's what if you give a talk at

00:54:57,740 --> 00:55:00,950
a conference he would be screwed up they

00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:03,380
and they record it so it's as permanent

00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:05,059
as your screencast right useful for

00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:07,609
courted thing but somehow it feels like

00:55:05,059 --> 00:55:09,430
nobody thought it was I'm not asserting

00:55:07,609 --> 00:55:15,500
that was perfect i was just on stage

00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:16,609
yeah hey where is I'd say what would be

00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,019
good practice they probably good

00:55:16,609 --> 00:55:18,279
practice

00:55:17,019 --> 00:55:20,529
me I should probably do it too now

00:55:18,279 --> 00:55:22,630
you've said it now I feel some now I

00:55:20,529 --> 00:55:25,569
feel like mmm because I'm afraid of it a

00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:28,059
little bit yeah so one of the things

00:55:25,569 --> 00:55:29,429
that I've started doing recently is so i

00:55:28,059 --> 00:55:31,929
have a blog where i talk about just

00:55:29,429 --> 00:55:33,459
anything and everything like whatever is

00:55:31,929 --> 00:55:35,499
on my mind so it's not just code stuff

00:55:33,459 --> 00:55:38,229
it's like the climbing trip that i went

00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:39,880
on or whatever and i started i got a

00:55:38,229 --> 00:55:41,319
camera last year so part of that is I

00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:42,699
was like oh I'll try and shoot some

00:55:41,319 --> 00:55:45,640
video put some video on YouTube that's

00:55:42,699 --> 00:55:47,169
basically my blog but in video form and

00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:50,739
one of the things like there's a post

00:55:47,169 --> 00:55:52,539
that I was working on about like Dropbox

00:55:50,739 --> 00:55:54,189
can't feel like discontinuing mailbox

00:55:52,539 --> 00:55:56,829
and carousel and like all the stuff and

00:55:54,189 --> 00:56:00,549
I actually wrote it and tried to read it

00:55:56,829 --> 00:56:02,829
on camera and the video was awful it was

00:56:00,549 --> 00:56:04,779
really bad and I was like okay this is

00:56:02,829 --> 00:56:06,880
way too formulaic like it's scripted I

00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:09,039
can't actually read this thing on camera

00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,509
and then I just said well here are the

00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:12,939
three things that I want to talk about

00:56:10,509 --> 00:56:14,649
and I just put them on a whiteboard in

00:56:12,939 --> 00:56:17,019
the blick behind the camera just three

00:56:14,649 --> 00:56:21,009
bullet points and winged it completely

00:56:17,019 --> 00:56:23,289
winged it and um the thing about like so

00:56:21,009 --> 00:56:25,599
for doing screencasts one of the things

00:56:23,289 --> 00:56:27,729
was before I edited it the raw video

00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:29,889
looked really bad like I was not happy

00:56:27,729 --> 00:56:31,089
with it i was gonna do like a couple

00:56:29,889 --> 00:56:34,299
more shots i was gonna try something

00:56:31,089 --> 00:56:35,819
else but I had a paused moment where I

00:56:34,299 --> 00:56:38,649
was like I don't really have time to

00:56:35,819 --> 00:56:39,699
take a hundred takes of this thing so

00:56:38,649 --> 00:56:41,229
I'm just gonna use the one that I have

00:56:39,699 --> 00:56:42,339
and I'll just edit it and if it's really

00:56:41,229 --> 00:56:46,479
bad I'll wait a week and I'll do it

00:56:42,339 --> 00:56:48,039
again mmm you know and so the raw video

00:56:46,479 --> 00:56:50,349
there was a lot of stopping a lot of

00:56:48,039 --> 00:56:52,569
like like me pausing and like not like

00:56:50,349 --> 00:56:55,479
getting choked up on my own words mm-hmm

00:56:52,569 --> 00:56:57,639
and when I edited it I was able to like

00:56:55,479 --> 00:57:01,959
edit all that stuff out you see be

00:56:57,639 --> 00:57:04,659
smooth huh after Eddie yeah yeah so um

00:57:01,959 --> 00:57:07,209
so that's that's the thing to like being

00:57:04,659 --> 00:57:09,249
able to do the screenshots I think at

00:57:07,209 --> 00:57:11,169
least for me I'm much better when i try

00:57:09,249 --> 00:57:16,719
and wing it scripted stuff doesn't I'm

00:57:11,169 --> 00:57:18,279
not good with scripts oh yeah have you

00:57:16,719 --> 00:57:19,959
seen any of my talks online have you

00:57:18,279 --> 00:57:22,139
ever watched me give a talk online yes

00:57:19,959 --> 00:57:24,459
yeah you're like compliments scripted

00:57:22,139 --> 00:57:26,949
knowing pletely scrutiny here's the

00:57:24,459 --> 00:57:30,400
problem like already there's so much

00:57:26,949 --> 00:57:33,250
stuff that if I go off script

00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:35,049
they go over time oh okay that make

00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:36,880
sense or I'll have that thing where you

00:57:35,049 --> 00:57:38,289
put a slide up and you think this would

00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:40,059
be a great thing to say right now and

00:57:38,289 --> 00:57:42,369
then you realize it's like better three

00:57:40,059 --> 00:57:44,230
slides from now and it was it was on its

00:57:42,369 --> 00:57:47,079
into speaker notes for three slides from

00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:51,900
out for a good reason yeah you know and

00:57:47,079 --> 00:57:54,640
so I I mean I do ad lib a little but

00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:56,789
it's that thing that obsessive editing

00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:59,170
which is why book stays yeah right

00:57:56,789 --> 00:58:00,940
because there's a there's like an almost

00:57:59,170 --> 00:58:02,829
perfect way to do it that will will

00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:04,720
compress the maximum amount of

00:58:02,829 --> 00:58:08,349
information into the smallest amount of

00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:10,150
space and if I don't you know I mean if

00:58:08,349 --> 00:58:13,480
I didn't maybe if I quit making you know

00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:17,859
500 slide coach Medlock's that would be

00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:21,099
a little easier but so I will say this

00:58:17,859 --> 00:58:24,579
for the the talks that I've given um I

00:58:21,099 --> 00:58:26,740
do have like speaker notes that are

00:58:24,579 --> 00:58:28,359
basically paragraphs mm-hmm and then I

00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:29,650
just kind of read over them and I don't

00:58:28,359 --> 00:58:32,170
actually look at them during the thing

00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:34,059
but like I'm I'm like I've read over

00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:38,650
them and read them with the slide so

00:58:34,059 --> 00:58:40,089
much that I can track it very well how

00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:41,650
many times is the right number of times

00:58:40,089 --> 00:58:47,319
to rehearse a talk before you give it in

00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:48,970
public ah so I will rehearse while I'm

00:58:47,319 --> 00:58:50,289
actually making the deck so I'll make a

00:58:48,970 --> 00:58:51,670
few slides and I'll go back through and

00:58:50,289 --> 00:58:54,460
read it and make sure like oh this flows

00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:56,920
okay when I get the slide deck done I'll

00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:58,630
do it maybe two times by myself and then

00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:01,119
maybe a third for another person and

00:58:58,630 --> 00:59:03,819
then I'll not actually do a rehearsal

00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:05,859
but just like like arrow key through the

00:59:03,819 --> 00:59:09,220
slides before like a few hours

00:59:05,859 --> 00:59:12,700
beforehand mm-hmm so so for me I do it

00:59:09,220 --> 00:59:15,190
I'd say end-to-end probably four times

00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:18,609
but I'm also doing it while putting the

00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:19,869
deck together as well so am I want you

00:59:18,609 --> 00:59:21,369
to answer that question how many times

00:59:19,869 --> 00:59:24,549
is the right number of times to rehearse

00:59:21,369 --> 00:59:27,400
a talk I think that sounds about right

00:59:24,549 --> 00:59:30,789
to me I mean I still have when a woman

00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:34,809
an experienced but uh yeah I was gonna

00:59:30,789 --> 00:59:37,750
say like three and a half ish including

00:59:34,809 --> 00:59:40,630
revisions during those time so I rather

00:59:37,750 --> 00:59:44,270
than that I just sorted rather than like

00:59:40,630 --> 00:59:46,550
Alex said I tended to

00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:48,380
try to lay it out like trying to try to

00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:50,210
make an outline and then make slides

00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:52,820
from that and then see how it actually

00:59:50,210 --> 00:59:54,440
goes in the thing and see us you know

00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:56,810
like oh this content should go before

00:59:54,440 --> 01:00:00,320
this content and see if that helps it be

00:59:56,810 --> 01:00:02,120
any better but yeah yeah so people

01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:04,970
should expect at least that right that

01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:07,310
would be the minimum yeah all right I

01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:09,380
mean I feel better like again I'm a

01:00:07,310 --> 01:00:13,070
little I'm an obsessive over preparer so

01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:14,570
I would do more but I don't I at one

01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:16,400
point I would tell people 10 10 is the

01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:18,470
right 10 is the right number of times to

01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,780
go through it front to back as if it

01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:22,550
were real in your office and I don't do

01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:26,390
that anymore I mean that was an excess

01:00:22,550 --> 01:00:30,950
of a paranoia but I for me it's like I

01:00:26,390 --> 01:00:32,390
don't I feel good on stage if I and also

01:00:30,950 --> 01:00:35,210
it's important to sleep between their

01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:36,560
rehearsals yes yeah right so you can't

01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:37,700
do it five times in one day like if I

01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:39,230
were going to do five times I would feel

01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:43,070
like I would have to do it once a day

01:00:39,230 --> 01:00:45,170
for five days yeah is and so I'm still

01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:47,810
probably in the five camp but closer to

01:00:45,170 --> 01:00:51,770
you closer to your numbers then I used

01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:54,200
to be Thank oh yeah i also have a

01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:58,400
tendency to wing it and that may or may

01:00:54,200 --> 01:01:00,110
not be to my benefit so important know

01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,210
some people were very good at that right

01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:03,620
i wish i would I wish I were better at

01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:10,370
the wing in it because then I could do

01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:12,260
let's prep yeah but either way like

01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:14,950
being better with prep or being better

01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:17,990
with I mean I guess it's all about like

01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:19,400
figuring out which way works best for

01:01:17,990 --> 01:01:22,400
you and the only way to do that is to

01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:26,330
give a talk at codon supply next month

01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:28,310
by filling out our form online perfect

01:01:26,330 --> 01:01:33,130
apply that country right now yeah I

01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:35,000
think you should uh Alex do you have any

01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:36,740
more things that you want to talk about

01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,050
I feel like we're getting close to time

01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:46,540
yeah we were getting pretty close to

01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:46,540
time I think Tiffany a head ass

01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:55,760
oh it was going so well looks like it

01:01:53,060 --> 01:02:04,720
looks like Alex might have dropped um I

01:01:55,760 --> 01:02:07,460
think what he was gonna say was was the

01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:12,200
blog post the wrong abstraction about

01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:15,050
like Syria's location oh did I cut out

01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:17,119
you cut out you were going on the name

01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:21,770
back but you were saying the wrong

01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:24,170
abstraction oh yeah so basically what

01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:29,119
led to to writing the ramen the wrong

01:02:24,170 --> 01:02:31,790
abstraction and because basically your

01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:35,230
assertion is duplication is cheaper than

01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:38,030
the wrong abstraction and so I guess

01:02:35,230 --> 01:02:43,280
what kind of led to to writing that post

01:02:38,030 --> 01:02:45,619
and and uh okay well first of all okay

01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:51,109
maybe cuz I could go on and on about

01:02:45,619 --> 01:02:53,060
that oh I I want to go pick a firm

01:02:51,109 --> 01:02:55,700
stance I'm not saying that dryness is

01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:57,830
bad I'm not saying that we should repeat

01:02:55,700 --> 01:03:03,170
ourselves okay like everything I'm about

01:02:57,830 --> 01:03:05,599
to say depends on people's ability to

01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:08,810
apply this advice to their own

01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:11,930
situations but here's what I see like my

01:03:08,810 --> 01:03:15,109
job now is to travel and look at code

01:03:11,930 --> 01:03:17,630
that's what I do I that's really it's

01:03:15,109 --> 01:03:20,119
what I do for living right and I see a

01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:22,910
phenomenal all the time where people

01:03:20,119 --> 01:03:24,470
have code bases maybe that other people

01:03:22,910 --> 01:03:26,000
wrote that have evolved over a period of

01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:27,800
years that have gone increasingly

01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:31,280
complex that they're having difficulty

01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:33,740
changing and very often it's because

01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:36,230
they have the wrong abstraction and so

01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:38,330
you can see this the you know you can

01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:39,859
tell because they had one piece of code

01:03:38,330 --> 01:03:41,480
that used to be called from a different

01:03:39,859 --> 01:03:46,430
play a bunch of different places and

01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:48,290
that code has over time evolved to

01:03:46,430 --> 01:03:51,170
contain conditionals and multiple

01:03:48,290 --> 01:03:52,849
execution pass through it okay and then

01:03:51,170 --> 01:03:54,020
they want someone wants a new change in

01:03:52,849 --> 01:03:55,369
that change we're just going to require

01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:57,470
like going in and change something has

01:03:55,369 --> 01:04:01,070
47 if saves in it

01:03:57,470 --> 01:04:02,270
and so I go and I look at their Cody in

01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:04,250
that that's always the code they want me

01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:05,599
to help them with right some something

01:04:04,250 --> 01:04:07,400
that even they understand it like

01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:09,650
there's no way for me to understand it

01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:10,820
at that point and when I look at it I

01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:13,160
say do you understand this in there i

01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:16,820
know we understand it cycling why are

01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:19,430
you work out of it this is not you know

01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:21,619
work it but they feel obligated to and

01:04:19,430 --> 01:04:24,160
when I tell them it's like this is where

01:04:21,619 --> 01:04:26,390
it's really handy to be internet sandy

01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:30,859
because I don't give people advice and

01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:33,980
they think it's right and so I Tom just

01:04:30,859 --> 01:04:35,390
take it back just take all that code and

01:04:33,980 --> 01:04:37,400
inline it back where it came from and

01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:38,720
delete all the stuff all the branches

01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:40,849
that don't go with the place where

01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:43,520
you're calling it from and then look at

01:04:40,849 --> 01:04:45,950
what you have and see if you know some

01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:50,510
it's easier and they look at me like

01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:53,180
they've been saved yeah it's clear that

01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:54,950
we just think to do that like we don't

01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:59,210
there's some way in which we feel as if

01:04:54,950 --> 01:05:01,940
we are not allowed and so that advice

01:04:59,210 --> 01:05:04,369
has come from my own experience of doing

01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:06,140
that but also from the fact that I I

01:05:04,369 --> 01:05:07,670
give that advice to people and then I

01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:10,359
see him six months later the conference

01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:14,330
and they're like oh my god you saved us

01:05:10,359 --> 01:05:16,970
and it's like rocket science it's almost

01:05:14,330 --> 01:05:18,589
anti rocket science right it's a thing I

01:05:16,970 --> 01:05:21,560
do because I don't understand their

01:05:18,589 --> 01:05:23,450
problem yeah and it's easy to you know

01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:25,280
just in line at all like reintroduce of

01:05:23,450 --> 01:05:27,440
duplication and move off in a different

01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:30,500
direction and so that it's funny that

01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:35,330
has gotten a lot of press a lot of

01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:38,930
retweet like it's a sign of how um much

01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:41,780
trouble this issue is causing us the

01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:45,800
amount of sort of buzz it has gotten on

01:05:41,780 --> 01:05:48,950
the internets yeah and so it's like

01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:50,869
let's just do the simple thing you know

01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:53,720
let's not be trapped into going forward

01:05:50,869 --> 01:05:55,099
if it's wrong like it's okay we can and

01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:57,020
we can be really generous right we can

01:05:55,099 --> 01:05:59,000
say what was what it was right at one

01:05:57,020 --> 01:06:02,000
point in time and things have changed

01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:04,460
and now it's wrong so let's rewind and

01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:07,910
think about it again I don't have to be

01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:09,740
bad or wrong you know no one has an evil

01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:11,220
for this code not to be right anymore

01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:14,070
yeah

01:06:11,220 --> 01:06:17,070
yeah no it's it's some really

01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:18,990
interesting I so I do embedded software

01:06:17,070 --> 01:06:21,210
now side I right on like for

01:06:18,990 --> 01:06:22,890
microcontrollers and one of the things

01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:25,080
that I've noticed is it often times when

01:06:22,890 --> 01:06:27,210
I'm trying to think through some logical

01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:30,630
problem the thing that I have to do is

01:06:27,210 --> 01:06:33,720
make a mess like and then clean it up

01:06:30,630 --> 01:06:34,980
after the fact because I like just can't

01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:36,270
whatever i'm trying to do i can't fit

01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:38,160
into what already exists so i just have

01:06:36,270 --> 01:06:40,290
to kind of like do what i was going to

01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:42,480
do make a mess and then like look and

01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:45,300
see how i can clean it up later and I

01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:47,880
feel like that talk sort of spoke to

01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:51,180
that process or that that blog post sort

01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:52,619
of spoke to that process that I do I

01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:54,359
thought it was it was really interesting

01:06:52,619 --> 01:06:56,730
and I know I know Tiffany was was

01:06:54,359 --> 01:06:58,530
curious about it as well just write it

01:06:56,730 --> 01:07:01,080
down just make it work it to green right

01:06:58,530 --> 01:07:06,840
can't watch it Kent says quick green

01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:08,580
excuses all sins yeah it's a green then

01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:10,230
you can refactor under green like many

01:07:08,580 --> 01:07:12,720
good things happen if you get working

01:07:10,230 --> 01:07:14,099
code and often that working code doesn't

01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:16,500
have lots of a level of an indirection

01:07:14,099 --> 01:07:17,880
in it like that it's often easier to get

01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:20,609
it working if you just write a couple of

01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:22,109
bad procedures yeah and I'm the old guy

01:07:20,609 --> 01:07:23,580
but i'll give you permission to do that

01:07:22,109 --> 01:07:24,660
right like right some bad procedures and

01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:25,890
look at them get the green they can

01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:28,500
refactor on a green it's much easier

01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:30,330
everything is easier if you act as if

01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:34,609
you don't understand the whole problem

01:07:30,330 --> 01:07:39,030
before i'm getting it all working yeah

01:07:34,609 --> 01:07:41,849
all right awesome so i think we are kind

01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:43,560
of wrapping up on time do you want to

01:07:41,849 --> 01:07:46,560
tell people where they can find you it

01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:52,020
on twitter etc etc at Sandy Mets on

01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:53,640
Twitter SI and di am etz i have really

01:07:52,020 --> 01:07:55,410
that's it i'm kind of unresponsive on

01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:58,050
twitter because you know I confessed

01:07:55,410 --> 01:08:00,300
early on in this podcast about not

01:07:58,050 --> 01:08:04,650
keeping up with the news but I am there

01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:06,480
and I do pay a little attention um yeah

01:08:04,650 --> 01:08:08,070
anyway that's the best way to reach I've

01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:13,260
website i have blah blah blah blah blah
