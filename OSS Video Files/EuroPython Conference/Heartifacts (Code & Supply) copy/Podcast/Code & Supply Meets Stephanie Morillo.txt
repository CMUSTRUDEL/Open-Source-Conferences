four years ago when a good friend of

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,990
mine taught me how to program and since

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,120

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,759
that you do so you said you're a writer

00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:36,810
your technical copywriter you also you

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:38,159
also have done a lot of things like

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,860
written essays on things like diversity

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,439
and tech hiring I'm just kind of curious

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,210
like how for you the journey into

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:49,229
becoming like joining the tech industry

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,729
and becoming a like entering that

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:54,689
industry what was that like for you like

00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:57,090
yeah yeah um I I want to say that I

00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:59,549
entered tech out of need basically um

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,670
when I started learning how to program I

00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:05,009
was in between jobs and things were

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,500
weren't looking too bright there weren't

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,819
too many jobs in the industry that I was

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,590
looking for communications and public

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:12,510
relations isn't an industry that's

00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:13,890
particularly growing and I was 14

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:16,230
agencies

00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,880
but during my time working at a

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,740
strategic communications firm for

00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,510
nonprofits I got into online engagement

00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,450
and one of the things that we were doing

00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:27,090
was working with a developer PHP

00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,590
developer to like basically update an

00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,180
entire clients website and that's when I

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,800
realized that I was really interested in

00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,690
I didn't really know what a developer

00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,310
was I didn't know how they differed from

00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:37,620
a web designer I didn't I didn't

00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,940
understand these things and um I started

00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,020
talking to a friend of mine one day and

00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,570
she was like you should really talk to

00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,550
my husband Steven Steven uh is a

00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:46,320
developer he's a programmer he builds

00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,720
websites and maybe he can teach you some

00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,420
stuff and um I met up with Steven and he

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,830
actually got me into ruby on rails that

00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:55,890
was his preferred technology at the time

00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:58,500
and then I started meeting with him once

00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:00,360
a week for two or three hours and I had

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,250
the time because I was unemployed so it

00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,640
actually worked out perfectly he gave me

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:08,040
an old um pc that he had installed

00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,870
ubuntu on so you know I because i was

00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,370
working with windows I mean my entire

00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:13,230
professional career I'd use Windows I

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,580
never used a mac so he was like all

00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:16,830
right now we're not going to use windows

00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,870
because no so here's the boom to so I'm

00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:20,940
here having to learn who wound to the

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,250
command line and of course learning ruby

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,320
and all these things and i had my ups

00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,790
and downs right i had my my times when I

00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,049
was like okay this is great movies great

00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:30,239
coating is great and then all the times

00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:32,610
that I got really really discouraged

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,019
moreover because I was learning to code

00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,930
with an end goal and the end goal was to

00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:39,079
get a job so when you have when you add

00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,310
that kind of pressure to yourself um

00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:43,470
coating can like learning how to code

00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:46,440
and code well seems like an

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:48,269
insurmountable task coding already takes

00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,030
up a lot of mental bandwidth I learned

00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:52,860
and and so it was it was a lot of it was

00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,930
a lot of me like having to learn how to

00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,660
program and also how to reteach myself

00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,070
how to take it easy that tech is really

00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,630
hard it's not that your dorm it's just

00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:03,420
that the stuff is kind of hard and not

00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,799
necessarily intuitive um and through

00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,900
doing that for about a year I started

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,540
taking some movie classes Rose classes

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,250
and Stephen was actually hired by

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,870
General Assembly to develop their back

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,930
end web development course it was a 10

00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:17,549
week course that focuses on Ruby and

00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:20,549
Ruby on Rails and they still offer this

00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:21,930
course and he asked me to be his

00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:22,979
teaching assistant for the first-ever

00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:25,050
course that they were going to produce

00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:26,820
here New York that was back in April of

00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,950
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,880
and that's how I got my start in both

00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:36,780
tech and startups um education tech

00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:38,370
coincidentally is nice yeah yeah so um I

00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,950
think it's interesting with we kind of

00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,990
there's this whole sort of movement now

00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:44,460
about like everybody needs to learn how

00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:46,050
to code and it's something that we've

00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,480
talked about on the show a little bit

00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:50,910
before and it sounds like you started

00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,680
learning how to code you didn't um you

00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:54,750
weren't trained in coding through school

00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,880
or anything so you started out in from a

00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:00,030
different track um do you think that

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,170
that was like I guess how was that

00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,480
experience she said it was you know a

00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:05,370
little bit rough to start out sometimes

00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:09,890
I'm just wondering like do you think

00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:13,020
that is a way that people can pursue or

00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:16,680
how do you view that whole aspect sure

00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:18,360
um I when I first started out I remember

00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,120
telling myself over and over again how I

00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,530
wish I could go back in time until 18

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,460
year old me that computer science was

00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:28,080
the way but I also i also came to terms

00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,590
with the fact that a lot of my education

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,000
and my learning really didn't gear me

00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,620
towards that track I grew up thinking

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,260
that if you were going into stem you

00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,390
have to be a genius for me anytime I'd

00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:41,100
hear kids major you know if I ever

00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:43,140
interacted with somebody who majored in

00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,550
in stem in college I remember thinking

00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,470
wow this person must be really smart

00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,720
they must know something that I just

00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:50,790
don't know um there was really no way 10

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,920
12 years ago when i was in college to

00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:56,070
know that tech would be what it is today

00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:58,680
I'm so in in that sense I think that

00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:00,750
it's it's I think it's totally fine to

00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,790
come into it as a mid-level professional

00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:04,530
and in fact I think it's a great thing I

00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:07,290
think it's an encouraging thing because

00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:09,390
a lot of us still have this belief that

00:06:07,290 --> 00:06:11,220
what we graduate when we graduate from

00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:12,510
college and the job that we go into is

00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:13,920
going to be what we're gonna do for the

00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:16,410
rest of our life like that's going to be

00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:17,880
the defining you know that's going to be

00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:20,220
the thing that defines everything you're

00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:23,250
going to do for the next 50 years that

00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:26,250
you are a productive citizen and I think

00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,930
that learning that encountering tech at

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,760
the point of my life that I did really

00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:31,500
helped me appreciate it because it was

00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,420
something that I really just wanted to

00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,580
do um it was something that I didn't

00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:37,140
know I had the capability of doing and I

00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,210
think it's always beautiful when a

00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,740
mid-level professional and and I think

00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,720
this is especially true

00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,789
people who are much older who are

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,009
already 20 30 years into their careers

00:06:44,789 --> 00:06:48,389
and and they come into coding and

00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:50,940
they're like wow you know tech is really

00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:53,940
interesting I think what it does is that

00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:56,340
it rekindles this uh this curiosity this

00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:57,990
love of learning and it really says that

00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,490
you and it really I think gives people

00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:02,819
the opportunity to reinvent themselves

00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:06,120
and frankly I think that my experience

00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:08,490
working in a different industry helped

00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,099
me come into tech with a much more

00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:12,300
nuanced worldview and just a view of

00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:14,729
what it's like to work in different

00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:17,039
environments in general I still

00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:18,389
primarily do writing for a living and

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,970
that's what I did when I graduated from

00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:22,710
college I was a writer but I write for a

00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:24,360
very very different audience in a very

00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:27,479
different industry and what I learned

00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:30,180
was I could take the knowledge that that

00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:32,729
I acquired you know learning how to code

00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:35,610
and interfacing with software developers

00:07:32,729 --> 00:07:37,979
and be able to use the skills that i

00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:39,389
already possess i was able to marry the

00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:41,909
two you know I didn't have to just leave

00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:45,210
one completely for the other arm and

00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:47,430
even then like my my interests have

00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:49,919
changed substantially based on where I

00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:52,050
work now I don't I don't do much I

00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,630
haven't done much software development

00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:56,490
coding at all i would say in over a year

00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:59,370
I'm really out of practice but I've

00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:00,719
started falling in love is falling an

00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,880
obsession I'd say I'm kind of obsessed

00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:04,440
with like anything to do with system

00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,270
administration now servers are

00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:08,400
fascinating to me deployment is

00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:11,039
fascinating I really like networking

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,719
networking like this is like I know I'm

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,979
doing things like the complete opposite

00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:15,960
way I feel like it's like you start off

00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:17,909
with networking and 19 then you go into

00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,520
software development know for me was the

00:08:17,909 --> 00:08:23,789
complete opposite um but that's also the

00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:27,150
fun thing is uh you know as I think as

00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:28,860
people progress in their career um in

00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:30,659
tech so it doesn't matter what when you

00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:32,700
come in you're always going to start

00:08:30,659 --> 00:08:34,589
piecing things together and and though

00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:38,180
the picture will get bigger and clearer

00:08:34,589 --> 00:08:42,959
you know the further you go along I

00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:48,630
think that that's a good point to bring

00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:53,279
up I feel like whenever I was going into

00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:54,360
school I I came from you know a sort of

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,029
traditional

00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:58,350
background of like going to school going

00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:00,870
to college or whatever and learning more

00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:03,480
stuff but I also had a lot of experience

00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:07,230
on my own like outside of classes and

00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:09,240
what not learning but I think that I

00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:12,149
know that my supervisor at my old job

00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,459
and one of my co-workers at my like one

00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:20,670
of the you know more senior people on my

00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:26,130
team now at Travis um both originally

00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:27,810
had anthropology degrees um and they you

00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:31,589
know just sort of got into it I think

00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:34,050
that there is a stigma almost against

00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:36,200
like like like you said before about um

00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:38,850
giving me computer science degree uh

00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:42,570
even specifically a computer science

00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:44,070
degree a lot of the things that you

00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:46,380
might learn in that degree you might not

00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:50,190
use I think that it's becoming a much

00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:58,640
more generalized a thing and you know

00:09:50,190 --> 00:10:02,910
sort of like Alex said we all we're all

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:05,120
being sort of pushed in this direction

00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:07,560
of like learn how to code and all right

00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,690
everybody is is being pushed into the

00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,130
tech field because I mean even and

00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:13,769
especially even coating you know

00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:15,269
whenever it comes to like the assistive

00:10:13,769 --> 00:10:17,130
administration stuff and whatnot you

00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:19,380
were talking about I mean that's that's

00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:21,660
where I came from and then even so all

00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:23,850
of that stuff is still managed by by

00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,959
code at this point I mean all of the

00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:29,760
networking stuff is just somebody's

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:31,470
application that you know simulates

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:35,100
those things between a bunch of VMs at

00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:40,050
this point so um like that stuff can be

00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:44,279
really hard but then I there's there's

00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:46,470
such a broad it's almost people say like

00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:48,990
working with computers as if it's like

00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:53,579
this generalized topic and it's actually

00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:55,740
like like most things at this point are

00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:58,399
all in that field and you know there's

00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:02,010
there's a place for for someone who's an

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:04,199
experienced writer it to be you know I I

00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:05,699
am one hundred percent positive that if

00:11:04,199 --> 00:11:07,740
I wrote about something and you wrote

00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:08,339
about something you could do way better

00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:12,360
than me

00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:13,949
because I don't I imagine that I you

00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:18,899
know that was one of my sticking points

00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:23,959
in in school um and whatever so yeah I

00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:27,449
think that's a good point um yeah yeah

00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:29,970
so I do want to go back to the comment

00:11:27,449 --> 00:11:31,139
you made about how you view like people

00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,850
that would go into computer sciences

00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:35,220
they had to be super geniuses because I

00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:37,620
think that that's something that does a

00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,809
serious disservice to our career and it

00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,009
like there's this this thing that's put

00:11:39,809 --> 00:11:42,809
out in the industry where it's like

00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:44,939
we're looking for a rockstar developer

00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:47,970
and we want to rock star a plus like we

00:11:44,939 --> 00:11:50,370
want you know we want somebody that like

00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:52,259
is just amazing everything we do and I

00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:57,089
think that sets an unfair standard like

00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:58,860
I would never call myself a rock star

00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:00,209
right like I would just met with it's

00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:04,079
not something that I would do and I feel

00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:06,629
like that one it automatically like

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,879
turns people off but I think it also not

00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:10,620
just from that job I think it also turns

00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:13,319
people off from the entire field because

00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:14,970
it's like oh this is such a like like if

00:12:13,319 --> 00:12:16,740
you're not the most amazing program or

00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:20,879
ever then these companies don't want to

00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:25,110
touch you when you know like I feel like

00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:26,819
I feel like it's it's not true like of

00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:29,100
all of the programmers in the world

00:12:26,819 --> 00:12:31,559
maybe like five percent of them are

00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,149
these super rock star genius types right

00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:35,579
but like most people are just writing

00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:37,110
you know a web service or something and

00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:38,249
they're they're they're really smart

00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:40,920
don't get me wrong they're really smart

00:12:38,249 --> 00:12:43,620
but they're not like they're they're not

00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:46,800
you know doing like nuclear physics or

00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:48,870
something to make the website so i just

00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,519
i thought it was an interesting point it

00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:54,240
like that I feel like that stigmatizes

00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:55,679
the field a little bit and also is some

00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,980
somewhat of a barrier to entry for

00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:00,360
people that wanna to come in so I guess

00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:03,029
do you have any thoughts on that

00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:06,240
specifically or how that is evolving or

00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:09,809
yeah um I mean I can just talk about it

00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:12,749
based on how like how that would play

00:13:09,809 --> 00:13:15,870
out in my head how you know I felt how I

00:13:12,749 --> 00:13:18,569
felt how I just learned how to it I

00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:20,879
internalize instead of just saying okay

00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:21,699
this instead of questioning the fact or

00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:24,069
acknowledge

00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:25,899
in the fact that the material was really

00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:28,119
difficult to learn because programming

00:13:25,899 --> 00:13:30,100
for me in particular was not very

00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:32,259
intuitive and I and even for the most

00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,839
even for the folks that are really

00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:37,139
really really smart and they still hit a

00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:39,220
wall everybody still hits a wall and I

00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:40,779
instead of just recognizing that I

00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:42,759
internalize that and I was like there

00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:44,290
has to be something with me maybe I

00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:46,600
could have done better with math when I

00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:49,089
was younger maybe if I was because I

00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:50,290
mean it's you know technology is still

00:13:49,089 --> 00:13:52,419
part of stem and I think when people

00:13:50,290 --> 00:13:53,859
talk about the sciences and you know

00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:55,389
we've revered those kinds of folks

00:13:53,859 --> 00:13:57,669
because there aren't a lot of them

00:13:55,389 --> 00:14:00,819
around we know that there's a lot of

00:13:57,669 --> 00:14:04,869
work involved in order to to acquire

00:14:00,819 --> 00:14:07,299
those skills that knowledge of with with

00:14:04,869 --> 00:14:10,600
with reason I mean these are I mean tech

00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:13,480
engineering science like though these

00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,399
are fields that that require that level

00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:19,569
of them detail and attention to detail

00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:21,160
so it's not it's not that that thing is

00:14:19,569 --> 00:14:24,999
necessarily it's not that that kind of

00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:27,579
reputation is I would say like not like

00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:32,439
mal earned or whatever but I would think

00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:34,749
that um if people really understood what

00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:37,569
a website was like the fact the reason

00:14:34,749 --> 00:14:39,129
why I think there is this whole like you

00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:41,470
have to be rocks are in a genius is

00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:43,839
because a lot of people don't see the

00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:46,600
magic they don't know what's behind the

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:49,359
screen they don't actually know how

00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:51,069
these things run they don't we don't and

00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:53,019
and technologists we don't do a very

00:14:51,069 --> 00:14:55,089
good job of communicating it with Pete

00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:56,739
to people we don't really tell people

00:14:55,089 --> 00:14:58,929
how the internet works we don't really

00:14:56,739 --> 00:15:00,339
tell people what goes into building a

00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:02,589
web application and I don't mean we have

00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:05,319
to go into like a hundred million steps

00:15:02,589 --> 00:15:07,929
just like on a very basic high level

00:15:05,319 --> 00:15:08,949
what is a web application I mean a lot

00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:11,139
of people don't know the difference

00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:13,149
between a web application and a website

00:15:11,139 --> 00:15:14,829
but for a developer would be obvious so

00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:18,039
a lot of things that are obvious to

00:15:14,829 --> 00:15:20,259
technologists are not as obvious to end

00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:22,359
users who don't have a technical

00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:24,879
background and certainly to people who

00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:27,489
aren't really aware of the field you

00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,109
know I feel I remember when I first saw

00:15:27,489 --> 00:15:31,119
the command line I remember seeing like

00:15:29,109 --> 00:15:32,740
all of the green you remember the matrix

00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:36,070
like when you do the conversion

00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:37,959
I mean I'm sorry yeah yeah that's what

00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:39,899
tech is you know and you see movies and

00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:42,279
it's always somebody you know just like

00:15:39,899 --> 00:15:43,720
furiously going away at the keyboard and

00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:47,709
typing out a whole bunch of stuff back

00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:49,959
and how words and something happens and

00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:51,459
because of that because of that

00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:53,560
particular kind of culture and then of

00:15:51,459 --> 00:15:55,330
course you know we have the midst of the

00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,490
person who has been programming since

00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:00,070
the age of 12 you know that's the text

00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:02,170
version of the Mozart bunder contino

00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:03,730
Mozart's been writing you know all kinds

00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:05,860
of crap since he was six years old

00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:08,589
that's like our equivalent of that kind

00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:12,640
of myth that methodical figure and I

00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:14,260
think that um having that is a is

00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,080
problematic because it doesn't make it

00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:19,089
approachable we should say yeah tuck is

00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:21,279
hard but it's approachable there are

00:16:19,089 --> 00:16:24,220
getting many different avenues to

00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,200
learning tech tech is not just building

00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,880
websites and web applications certainly

00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,589
that is a huge thing because we interact

00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,880
with those things day to day but there

00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:34,270
are actually a lot of other components

00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:37,060
that go into into tech into the web um

00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:38,980
and I think that is also an issue the

00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:40,899
fact that we have not done a good job of

00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:43,779
communicating the actual tech ecosystem

00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:45,940
I mean I didn't I didn't know what other

00:16:43,779 --> 00:16:48,279
people there were there aside from

00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:50,709
software developers I didn't know yeah I

00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:52,240
sort of knew what a network was maybe

00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,770
not really i didn't know that there are

00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,880
people that were administrating a

00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:56,709
network i didn't know that there were

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,690
people engineering a network you know

00:16:56,709 --> 00:16:59,950
that all of these things and then as i

00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:02,079
start learning about all of these

00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:04,059
different pieces when they start falling

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,220
together i get mad at myself because I'm

00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:07,839
like dough that makes sense but I don't

00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:09,520
know what I don't know and the public

00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,500
doesn't know what it doesn't know so if

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,929
we did a better job of communicating

00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,850
what we do what different careers are

00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:17,679
out there I think people would start to

00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:19,600
feel they start to see themselves in

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,220
something because not everybody who goes

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,319
into tech or has an interest in tech

00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,179
wants to be a software engineer and

00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:27,579
neither should we push people to go

00:17:25,179 --> 00:17:28,840
solely into the software engineer my

00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:32,920
software engineering me almost

00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:34,960
exclusively web developer route um so if

00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:39,340
you know if we continue I think to offer

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:41,590
this myopic uh like view of what tech is

00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:43,660
and then if we continue to surround it

00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:46,659
with all of these myths I think you know

00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:48,519
it does make it hard for for anyone um

00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:50,590
you know would have an interest but

00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:52,299
wouldn't know where to start to feel

00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:57,909
that you know maybe there's a place for

00:17:52,299 --> 00:18:00,309
them they're cool yeah um so I one of it

00:17:57,909 --> 00:18:03,599
I want to shift gears a little bit I

00:18:00,309 --> 00:18:06,340
know that you've uh you've done a lot of

00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:09,119
community development things like that I

00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:11,499
know you've also uh you've written about

00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:17,830
things like diversity written about

00:18:11,499 --> 00:18:20,529
things like how privileged is tied with

00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:23,710
privacy I was wearing if you want to

00:18:20,529 --> 00:18:25,629
talk about those things as well um yeah

00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:27,190
for sure um is there anything specific

00:18:25,629 --> 00:18:30,429
you want to talk about it just like in

00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:32,710
general like just in general like your

00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:35,460
view approaching those topics cuz I feel

00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:40,919
like they're they're topics that are

00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:43,869
becoming more like they're becoming more

00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:45,429
forefront I guess and yeah just your

00:18:43,869 --> 00:18:48,639
experience with a quit tackling them I

00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:51,190
think that a good way to segue into that

00:18:48,639 --> 00:18:54,099
would be you know we're talking about um

00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:56,909
getting into tech and whatnot but there

00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:59,289
I still it's it's easy and there it's

00:18:56,909 --> 00:19:02,049
easy in some ways because there are a

00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:04,599
lot of resources out there and I you

00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:07,239
know I think a large number of people

00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:08,830
like sort of knew a friend or somewhat

00:19:07,239 --> 00:19:11,019
something like that who could sort of

00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:14,080
help them really get excited about these

00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:15,879
things or you know even meetup groups

00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:18,549
like code and supply but there is still

00:19:15,879 --> 00:19:24,489
a diversity barriers to a lot of those

00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:25,509
communities and I think that what the

00:19:24,489 --> 00:19:29,830
work that you've done is really

00:19:25,509 --> 00:19:32,950
important but uh please from there thank

00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:35,289
you thank you yeah um so I what got me

00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:37,450
interested in in it's interesting like

00:19:35,289 --> 00:19:39,609
now when I think about my writing I

00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:41,139
really do think about where i was in my

00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:43,389
in my journey and tech at that

00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:46,659
particular time and and that's kind of

00:19:43,389 --> 00:19:48,340
what i started focusing on so um one of

00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:50,919
my first pieces i think my first piece

00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:53,379
was about feel-good stories like you

00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:56,619
know how how you know the tech industry

00:19:53,379 --> 00:19:58,599
rallies behind feel-good stories but we

00:19:56,619 --> 00:20:00,490
those aren't sustainable and i think i

00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:03,429
use an example of this

00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:06,090
one man who he was homeless here in New

00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:08,290
York City and a young entrepreneur um

00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:10,929
offered to teach him how to program and

00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,550
he taught this man had a program and I

00:20:10,929 --> 00:20:14,170
remember how it was like all the rage a

00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:16,240
few years ago you know he was in he was

00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:19,540
in the newspapers in the media but um

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,309
after the media died down I learned that

00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,840
maybe a month or two after the last

00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:24,700
article that had been written about him

00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,080
he was still homeless and he was still

00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:29,020
looking for a place to live and I just

00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,630
remember thinking how the the story in

00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:33,880
the path to tech or you know to a career

00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:36,490
that is for you know that that can be

00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,440
lucrative on it is a career that can

00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:40,390
really help people get gainful

00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:43,270
employment it's still not very easy to

00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:45,100
go into I mean when I started working at

00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:46,960
a start-up there were very few people of

00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,100
color in that in particular I mean when

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,990
it comes to people of color in

00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:52,179
particular that is always something that

00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:55,300
strikes out to me because I identify as

00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:56,679
a person of color first so um I just

00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:59,410
remember thinking wow they're not

00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:01,450
they're not a lot of us here um this is

00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:03,670
hard to get into and then I start as

00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:06,370
time started go you know as time went on

00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:07,809
I realized that uh you know not only my

00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:09,580
one of the few women of color I'm one of

00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:12,100
the few native new yorkers you know who

00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:14,110
works here I'm one of the few XYZ who

00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:16,960
works here and I started to see that too

00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:19,210
in the greater tech community as I

00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,740
started participating and going to start

00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:22,720
to conferences and things like that's

00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:26,110
different tech conferences people are

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,940
generally I think most people that I've

00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:29,890
encountered any way are really well

00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:32,980
meaning and really want up and really

00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:35,650
want to get the diversity question right

00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:37,059
so to speak and that everybody wants to

00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:38,710
everybody this is a problem that

00:21:37,059 --> 00:21:41,530
everybody that a lot of people want to

00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:44,170
solve a lot of people wanna want to see

00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:46,780
salt it is not a very easy thing to

00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:50,770
tackle and even in my work in my writing

00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:53,320
in my community work um I find that it

00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:56,950
is uh it's still difficult because i

00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:59,050
myself am learning um you know I have to

00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:01,510
recognize privileges that i have over

00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:02,800
other people and that's not always an

00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:07,179
easy thing to do and it's not always

00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:10,390
easy to UM come to terms with with that

00:22:07,179 --> 00:22:12,610
or you know find like or you know like

00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:13,960
it's it's really it's just really messy

00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,490
thats really

00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,470
it's really hard I think to make sense

00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:18,850
of I write a lot about it but I can't

00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,620
tell you that I understand it any better

00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:22,390
now than I did in the beginning if

00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:24,490
anything I think now that it's just a

00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:27,220
lot more convoluted and very messy just

00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:29,890
because I've worked in it longer but I

00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:32,620
think that nonetheless it is a very it

00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:35,140
is a worthwhile effort and I do hope

00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:37,480
that um people in text start seeing

00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:42,100
diversity as more than just a check mark

00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:45,880
to take off um and also to take people

00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:47,350
who do work in diversity to take them

00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,970
seriously especially the people that

00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:52,020
devote themselves to it I don't consider

00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:56,080
myself a diversity expert whatsoever um

00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:57,549
but i but i do care about it i mean i

00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,730
know that they're people that have that

00:22:57,549 --> 00:23:02,890
had created careers out of helping you

00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:05,830
know with policy you know corporate

00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:08,110
policy helping um companies with

00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:10,419
diversity initiatives all kinds of stuff

00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:12,990
and I think that those are people who we

00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:15,429
need to tap into and we need to

00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:17,620
frequently bring into this conversation

00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:20,200
a lot because they definitely have

00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:23,320
perspectives that um you know a lot of

00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:25,419
us a lot of us don't and I think that

00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,880
when we start seeing them as a as

00:23:25,419 --> 00:23:31,659
another part of the the tech ecosystem

00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:33,010
of the tech industry um I I hope that

00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:35,649
that will begin to change the

00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:48,279
conversation and hopefully we'll start

00:23:35,649 --> 00:23:52,450
seeing more positive change yeah yeah i

00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:55,770
think the the topic of diversity is

00:23:52,450 --> 00:24:00,750
pretty near and dear to me in some ways

00:23:55,770 --> 00:24:04,830
coming from or from the the queer women

00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:09,429
angle and whatnot which stays a lot of

00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:17,649
stuff about as well but I that's another

00:24:09,429 --> 00:24:22,690
podcast um uh yeah it's interesting I

00:24:17,649 --> 00:24:26,139
don't know uh coming into my old job I

00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:27,750
think I was like one of four women on my

00:24:26,139 --> 00:24:31,260
particular

00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:33,900
um on my floor of the building or

00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:36,540
whatever out of like 50 people or

00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:38,640
something like that and you know

00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:43,380
definitely the only one in

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:47,730
infrastructure um and that's that's a

00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:51,330
pretty common thing uh and it would the

00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:54,240
ratio was even worse as far as people of

00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:56,370
color were concerned and that's really

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,070
sad to see it was and that's the average

00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:02,370
company uh it's funny because we get

00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:08,160
sort of there's there's at least a lot

00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:10,650
of um awareness in in the startup sphere

00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:13,920
and in the the sort of like online super

00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:17,310
connected so you have everything but I a

00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:19,290
large number of tech jobs still remain

00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:20,880
to be the ones that are not where were

00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:23,030
you know like where I've already heard

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,680
of you I already follow you on twitter

00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:30,540
all this thing that I've I have friends

00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:35,640
who know you and whatever um so I it's

00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:37,760
almost um I don't know it makes you

00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:40,440
realize that it's a much bigger issue

00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:44,400
whenever you can sort of stand back and

00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:47,930
look at like like even in our somewhat

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:53,180
more idealized still not very idealized

00:25:47,930 --> 00:25:57,990
um environment we still don't have um

00:25:53,180 --> 00:26:05,130
it's still a major fight and uh not

00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:07,290
fight but um I struggle and something

00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:09,300
that we need to be mindful of I don't

00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:11,880
know yeah I know that makes that makes a

00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:15,480
lot of sense um sorry Alex I'm gonna cut

00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:17,550
you off oh no sir elton um so I like I

00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:19,560
don't know I've had to be honest um

00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:22,200
recently I've had to just step back a

00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:25,590
bit from the diverse from the diversity

00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:28,620
conversation or even like talking about

00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:32,880
it frequently because I've noticed like

00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:35,070
how that affected my mental health you

00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,100
know just like always being I feel like

00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:39,660
it's it's it's also i feel like the

00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:41,670
problem that i encountered was that I

00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:43,470
felt like as a person who was

00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:45,630
of an underrepresented group that the

00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:47,880
onus was somewhat on me to bring up

00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:50,730
these topics and to talk about it and to

00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,260
bring it up and I'm you know I've gotten

00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:54,510
to a point kind of where I'm a little

00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:57,150
tired of a feeling that I have to be the

00:26:54,510 --> 00:27:00,210
person to talk about it all the time

00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:01,470
which which makes me sad too because I

00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:03,780
feel like it's not that I don't care

00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:05,550
about these issues these issues affect

00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:06,720
more than just me they affect all kinds

00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:10,140
of people so these are issues that I

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:11,910
care about very very dearly but I've

00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,620
also had to learn to step back from the

00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:17,820
conversation because it can be something

00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:19,830
that is potentially engulfing it takes a

00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,300
lot of like I remember just spending a

00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:23,490
lot of time talking about it thinking

00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:25,440
about it working through it on working

00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:27,180
about you know talking about it at

00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,560
conferences um through my through my

00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:30,990
stuff with women of color in touch at

00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,850
all of that stuff and then I started

00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:34,620
feeling that all of my focus and my

00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:37,740
attention was going towards that

00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:39,570
conversation and I didn't feel I felt

00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:41,490
like I was expending energy and I wasn't

00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:43,740
conserving any energy and I wasn't I'm

00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:46,830
actually spending time doing the things

00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:49,440
that I really wanted to be doing um so

00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:51,750
I've I've actually given myself a bit of

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:55,020
permission to I've given myself the

00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:57,330
permission to just not be as in involved

00:27:55,020 --> 00:28:01,050
in the conversation you know I feel that

00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:02,970
that to being an observer really allows

00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:05,190
me to learn so if i if I'm just

00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:07,530
listening I can listen to other peoples

00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:09,870
to other groups to other people's issues

00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:11,670
and concerns I don't always have to

00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:14,160
comment about it I don't always have to

00:28:11,670 --> 00:28:16,560
be the person with an opinion on it

00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,880
because I'm not a diversity expert this

00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,470
is something that I want to make clear

00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,990
it's not it's not something that I do

00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:24,450
professionally and I think that they're

00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:27,660
professionals they're people like like

00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:30,570
Nicole Sanchez of github like ash Dryden

00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:32,640
who do an excellent job of this kind of

00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:35,490
work and they understand it on many

00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,800
different levels and I think that that

00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:39,390
you know I want to talk about it but I

00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:40,800
also want people to know hey there are

00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:43,620
people that are actually working on this

00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:45,570
and they're doing really great work and

00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:47,250
we should we should bring them into the

00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:48,720
conversation as soon as possible so I

00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:52,710
think that's the that's the posture that

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,090
I've taken recently yeah that's totally

00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:56,549
understandable

00:28:54,090 --> 00:29:05,750
not to belabor the point or anything but

00:28:56,549 --> 00:29:08,340
yeah it's uh I I don't even you know I

00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:12,210
you know followed some folks like cash

00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:14,580
and and whomever I even whenever I was

00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:18,059
in school and by the time that I i got

00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:20,190
into tech as sort of like just trying to

00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:22,350
like into the actual industry out of

00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:27,240
school and out of you know whatever has

00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:29,580
already sort of trying to cuz it yeah it

00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:32,279
and I've seen a number of other folks

00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:35,120
sort of do the same sort of thing right

00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:38,940
where it just gets to be a whole lot

00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:43,070
yeah so I can't blame you is i guess and

00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:48,480
i will i'll stop pushing it after that

00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:49,890
yeah I I think um I was so I just think

00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,799
I work sometimes I'll just like put some

00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:53,820
talk on like in the background I'm not

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,309
actually watching it i just have the

00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:58,140
audio whatever i mean the one that I one

00:29:56,309 --> 00:30:00,960
of the ones that I did today I was

00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:03,779
listening to Kent Beck sees at work I

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,460
don't either if you've seen it he talks

00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:07,529
about just being comfortable at work but

00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:11,520
one of the things that he opened up with

00:30:07,529 --> 00:30:13,860
was um somebody had come up to him and

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,080
said like I feel like I have to leave

00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:18,270
parts of myself like I have to cut off

00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:20,669
parts of myself from entering the office

00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:24,330
and that was kind of like I guess in the

00:30:20,669 --> 00:30:25,470
forefront of my mind as we're talking

00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:27,450
about this is that I feel like that's

00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:35,070
kind of not a position that you want to

00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:38,610
be in but uh huh uh huh so I guess just

00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:41,730
go back to talking about um telling tech

00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:44,850
stories i guess like telling it this the

00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:48,630
story of technology and and the lense

00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:50,730
you work at digital ocean now yeah do

00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:54,179
you like what are some tools that you

00:30:50,730 --> 00:30:56,640
use to try and and help tell that story

00:30:54,179 --> 00:30:59,190
for digital ocean or four companies or

00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,880
places that you've been add in the past

00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:05,039
yeah um the story I'm sorry the story of

00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,080
up late like just but the story of

00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:07,900
technology as you see it because you can

00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:10,420
also block

00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:12,670
about like beginning web development and

00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:13,900
yeah yeah resources that you see she

00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,610
thought about a lot of different things

00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,910
I'm just wondering what are some of the

00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:22,480
some of the things you found that are

00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:25,090
easy ways to help tell that story in

00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:27,130
your writing yeah what has been helpful

00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:29,500
has been trying to do something and

00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:31,510
messing it up completely and then

00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,430
figuring out how it works and then

00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:36,070
writing about it that's seriously how I

00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:38,680
that's actually when I realized that I

00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:41,890
wanted to be a writer working and

00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:43,360
Technology not necessarily a tech at

00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:45,340
first I thought maybe a technical writer

00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,530
I'm not a technical writer I'm a

00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:50,470
copywriter but nonetheless I'm a writer

00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:52,860
who writes for a technical audience and

00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:56,170
I realized that what I really loved was

00:31:52,860 --> 00:32:00,400
getting completely trying to figure out

00:31:56,170 --> 00:32:02,560
how something work not it not working on

00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:04,060
it breaking apart a lot and then finally

00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,680
figuring out and then I'm like okay I'm

00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:08,020
gonna write about it and I'm going to

00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:09,820
try to help somebody you know with a

00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:12,330
little humor inject a lot of humor in it

00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:14,500
because it is kind of humorous um and

00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:16,630
hopefully you know someone will get

00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:19,150
value out of it because I what I love

00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:22,210
writing and blogging about ism I like

00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:24,370
things being clear and concise I like um

00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:26,050
I want people to know that you're not

00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:31,450
the only one that this has happened to

00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:33,190
um and I also love that it I don't know

00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,570
one of the things I like about tech and

00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:37,330
the stuff that I have to do my day to

00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:39,040
day because I do have to actually know

00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:41,200
how to use the platform so that's why

00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,450
I've been tweeting a lot recently about

00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,210
linux and networking and all this stuff

00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:48,310
because I'm trying like everybody else

00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:50,380
you know get a web server running and

00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:52,060
then you know I have a firewall because

00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:54,130
I don't want somebody in Turkey like

00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:55,810
today by the way I figured out my server

00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:57,820
logs if somebody from Turkey was trying

00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:59,740
to break it to my server and I flip out

00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,910
and you know like this kind of stuff and

00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:02,950
I'm just trying to figure it out because

00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:05,080
if I figure it out then it's easy for me

00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:07,150
to communicate that to an audience who

00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,860
presumably has a certain level of

00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:10,600
technical knowledge and is coming you

00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:12,280
know going to the digital ocean website

00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,530
to learn a little bit more about you

00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,550
know our products or whatever so I'm one

00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:17,680
of the things that I'm really excited

00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:19,120
about my job is that my job really is to

00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,680
learn and is to learn as much as

00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,860
possible so that i can then communicate

00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:25,520
that to

00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:27,230
people in a very clear way similar to

00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,940
how our technical writers you know are

00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:31,100
tasked with having to figure that out

00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:33,740
and then write out the tutorials and the

00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:35,150
articles to help you get you know

00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:39,410
whatever it is that you need to get up

00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:41,120
up and running so so yeah I think that's

00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:44,980
that's what I love about it is that I

00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:47,960
think it's a it the writing about that

00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:49,790
keeps the focus on the learning and the

00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,220
experience of the learning and the joy

00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:54,650
of learning because it's not always easy

00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:56,870
it's often very hard and I think what

00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:58,370
makes it hard to is that I'm the kind of

00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:01,490
person that's afraid of afraid to ask

00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:03,020
you no right to ask questions but then

00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:05,179
learning how to overcome that just to

00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:06,950
like to figure out this problem and then

00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:08,480
feeling elated when I finally figure out

00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:10,490
this problem and then feeling like wow

00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,810
this person was so awesome they helped

00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:15,109
me through this problem that I thought I

00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:17,840
couldn't get get past um so that's what

00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:20,179
I think I'd really love about my job and

00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,980
what I love about being a writer in tech

00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:25,129
I mean I think that's why every that's

00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:27,200
why a lot of developers blog I I really

00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:28,879
hope that's the kind of spirit that's

00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:31,580
the kind of spirit I would love to see

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:34,280
more projects inject into their

00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:35,720
documentation you know that like wow you

00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,040
know we figured out this thing that was

00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,330
really really cool and we know it's

00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,470
going to help you and I'm going to show

00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:42,109
you how it's going to help you and why

00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:43,970
it's gonna change things for you it's if

00:34:42,109 --> 00:34:45,919
we saw that kind of attitude I think

00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:47,840
people would would understand why

00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:49,460
they're writing is so important my

00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,440
documentation for example is so

00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:54,619
important when you look at it through

00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,710
that lens so I don't know if that

00:34:54,619 --> 00:35:00,140
answers your question that was kind of

00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:03,740
definitely does I I really like the idea

00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:05,780
of like fostering the sort of culture of

00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:07,850
learning like I really like that a lot

00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:09,020
it's really interesting you said like so

00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:11,420
much of what you do is you learn by

00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:13,250
breaking things that's basically like

00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:15,530
that's the thing that I tell people all

00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:19,060
the time I've become at work I've become

00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:21,350
kind of the resident get expert yeah and

00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:22,910
people all the time or like how do you

00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:26,000
know this and I was like I messed up a

00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:27,770
lot that's how like but you're seeing it

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:32,210
now you should have seen it like three

00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:34,490
four years ago it was bad yeah that's

00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:35,510
and that's and then it's and then you

00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:37,010
get excited

00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:38,720
tell people how was it you figure it out

00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:40,580
and then it becomes a story I think when

00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:42,650
you yeah that's why a lot of I try to

00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:46,160
keep my blog posts as story like as

00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:48,320
possible because um it helps me it helps

00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,720
me remember it and it also keeps that on

00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:54,290
that feeling of excitement alive and my

00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:55,760
writing um so yeah so breaking things as

00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:57,320
much as possible and then documenting it

00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,230
and I would recommend that anyone who

00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:01,610
works in tech do this and it not it

00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:05,090
doesn't mean necessarily need to be

00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:06,800
something that somebody else reads you

00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:08,480
know if particularly if you don't feel

00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,210
at your strong writer it really is just

00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,250
more about yourself and to just

00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:17,000
encapsulate that feeling of how it felt

00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:20,300
to finally get past whatever obstacle it

00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,920
was that you got got past um because I

00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,480
think having that that feeling is

00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,610
extremely important especially when

00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,990
you're trying to to help other people or

00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:29,600
if you encounter the problem again

00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:31,400
you're like okay you know what happened

00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,860
the first time around how was I feeling

00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,620
how did I get past it alright cool like

00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:40,580
now I have context and now I can I can

00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:43,310
you know hopefully get past it I think

00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:44,780
that's one of the one of the great

00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:49,670
things about something like shameless

00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:53,680
plug codon to play you know that's um i

00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:59,360
plug anymore if it's on our podcast

00:36:53,680 --> 00:37:01,010
would um yeah I mean I've given a couple

00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:05,810
of talks even about really basic things

00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:09,020
because I realized that um you know and

00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:13,820
I I really enjoyed Alex's get tuck uh

00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:17,270
some some time ago I was really cool and

00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:20,150
informative and you know I I was the get

00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:22,100
expert at my job and I had given a

00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:24,890
similar talk you know some time before

00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:27,350
that whenever we were they were just

00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:33,620
moving some stuff off of a subversion to

00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:38,260
get um and yeah I I really like that

00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:41,510
idea I've been on my own just trying to

00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:44,060
push myself to like you know any anytime

00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:45,950
that I figure something out or I feel

00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:49,250
like I know this thing like relatively

00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:51,500
okay and like I should make like a bug

00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:55,670
posted like a screencast or something

00:37:51,500 --> 00:38:00,140
like that um I I am really happy to see

00:37:55,670 --> 00:38:01,400
that a lot of people do that um I feel

00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:03,620
like a screencast would probably work

00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,990
better for me in some some cases you

00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:07,430
know re whatever I mean like even like

00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:10,340
you were saying before about networking

00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:14,090
or whatever I give a little thing about

00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:15,890
networking because I um you know I

00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:17,900
understand it really well but I talked

00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:20,150
to other people who I considered to be

00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:23,320
very very sorry people who were like I

00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:25,970
learned a lot from you in this thing um

00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:29,630
even you know sort of like you said

00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:32,180
before I we don't do a good we

00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:35,720
developers don't do a super great job of

00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:37,910
explaining how everything actually works

00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:39,740
in like a web application I think that's

00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:42,470
Eden to each other and you know that's

00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:47,450
that's partially that's personally an

00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:50,180
okay thing I mean um it's less stress in

00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:52,430
some ways but it's also sometimes it's

00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:55,460
nice to to have a more generalized you

00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:57,320
know knowledge yeah I think it's just

00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:59,750
more like a general knowledge and

00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:01,850
awareness versus like this is exactly

00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:03,590
how every single component works because

00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:06,740
that's that's just not feasible it's not

00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:08,990
possible um but it's it's I think it's

00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:11,690
nice to know like you know what other

00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:14,060
things touch upon whatever it is that

00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:16,640
the thing you're doing um touches upon

00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:19,490
um and it just goes to show that there's

00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:21,380
so much so much to learn and I think

00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:23,480
that's also a very encouraging thing too

00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:24,830
for beginners intact when they come

00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:27,530
across people that are really really

00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:29,440
knowledgeable and have really like deep

00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:31,550
domain knowledge in one particular area

00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,230
but that person doesn't that doesn't

00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:35,510
necessarily mean that they have that

00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:38,810
deep of a technical expertise in other

00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:40,340
areas so when beginners know realize

00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:42,170
that they're like okay great so doesn't

00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:44,690
mean that I happen to know every single

00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:46,910
thing that there ever was about

00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:49,070
technology you know I can still focus on

00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:51,110
one thing but have like a general

00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:55,760
knowledge or understanding or awareness

00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:58,640
of you know other aspects so yeah it's

00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:03,440
an interesting landscape in general and

00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:06,560
it's uh yeah I like the Justin

00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,840
always says like every code and supply

00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,740
event pretty much he says like you

00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,000
should come like if you're thinking

00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,260
about giving a talk you should come and

00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,930
give a talk because everybody knows

00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:17,540
something that other people in the room

00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:19,220
don't know and like they would find

00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:21,110
interesting so like everybody has

00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:23,330
something that they can teach somebody

00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:27,950
else right and so I really like that

00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:30,400
kind of I like that specifically as a

00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:32,510
call to action for people to give talks

00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:41,030
yeah that's you're listening to this

00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:45,140
give a talk awesome but right we are

00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:48,230
kind of getting um a little bit close to

00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:49,970
time so I'm going to sort of throw it to

00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:51,320
you Stephanie to do like any kind of

00:40:49,970 --> 00:40:55,040
plugs where can people find you on

00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:59,990
Twitter um your blog everything for sure

00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:01,220
hey I was gonna say real quick just if

00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:02,750
you want to say a couple words about

00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:04,870
your singing career because that's what

00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:08,750
yeah that's right you're a musician too

00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:11,780
for that okay i'm putting ready before

00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:17,000
it as like stephanie marie oleg check

00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:18,230
out spot if I'm like oh yeah it's so yes

00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,720
that's true it's something that I've

00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:24,470
kind of been like hiding a little bit

00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:27,050
recently but not so much so no that's

00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:28,670
totally cool so I actually it's funny

00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:30,800
it's only recently that I've started to

00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:32,870
see myself as a musician second it used

00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,060
to be first up until about like a year

00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:37,700
or two ago um but I started out singing

00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:39,890
I'm classical music when I was 14 and I

00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:43,400
thought that I wanted to go into opera

00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:44,810
um I was then 24 and realized okay I

00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:46,910
don't really want to go into opera as

00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:49,700
much anymore so I started gigging and

00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:51,920
just performing around New York um doing

00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:56,300
like a lot of bossa nova jazz kind of

00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:58,250
stuff and then um yeah I started working

00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:59,630
on a music blog so i worked on a music

00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:01,400
blog that was based out of Brooklyn for

00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:02,690
about three years and when i was living

00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,340
in malaysia i worked at a music magazine

00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:05,870
so i had the opportunity to just like

00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:08,360
hang around with a lot of musicians and

00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:12,890
when I came back I started working on my

00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:15,200
own music um and in December of 2014 I

00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:16,320
released an EP and I did a music video

00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,270
and I did

00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:21,090
you know put up like all the bells and

00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:22,230
whistles for that um but yeah music and

00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:24,390
singing is something that I've been

00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:25,800
doing it since I was about six years old

00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:27,960
so it's something that's very near and

00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,840
dear to my heart I think singing was the

00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:32,730
thing that um really really helped me

00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:34,260
dream and really helped me kind of get

00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:35,550
out like I grew up in the Bronx I grew

00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:38,190
up in the inner city wasn't so great

00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:39,900
back in the 90s and I'm singing in music

00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:42,450
in particular really helped me kind of

00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:43,890
escape that it was like my escape um I

00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:46,740
always thought of myself as you know

00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:48,870
them being famous one day I'd learn I've

00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:50,790
since grown and those aren't the dreams

00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:53,160
that I had but I love music nonetheless

00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:55,770
and I'm it's something that I that I do

00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:58,200
for myself mostly now I did perform

00:42:55,770 --> 00:43:01,140
though at a at a Brooklyn jas a
